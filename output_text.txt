Real estate investing is an expensive habit. You need money to
finance the purchase, renovate your fixer-upper, and cover
the holding costs while you prepare to sell or rent the property.The good news is that it doesn’t all have to be 
your money. In fact,
the less of your own money you can use and the more you can
borrow, the bigger the return on your investment. Add the poten-tial credit and market woes like the first decade of the 2000s, andinvesting in real estate also becomes a bit more of an adventure.
Lining up financial resources well in advance of scouring the neigh-
borhood for investment opportunities enables you to pounce on abargain and gives you leverage in negotiating the price you ulti-mately pay for a property. When you place an offer on a house andother bids come in, the seller may accept your offer of thousandsof dollars less simply because you have the financing in place toquickly close the deal. Ready cash also frees you to plan and beginrehabbing the property immediately instead of waiting around forsluggish loan approvals and credit checks.
If you’re thinking that you can’t possibly get your mitts on enough
cash to finance your venture, 
Financing Real Estate Investments For
Dummies is the book for you. Here you discover the best sources
for investment capital and how to go about tapping into these
sources to fuel your next venture.
About This Book
This book isn’t a get-rich-quick guide to investing in real estate 
or a guide or a tutorial on how to buy property with no moneydown (although we do cover that topic). 
Financing Real Estate
Investments For Dummies delivers what the title promises — a
treasure map that shows you where to find sources of real estate
investment capital and guidance on how to dig it up.
Ralph and Chip are both seasoned investors. We’ve each built wealth
through investing in real estate — buying and selling fixer-uppers andbuying and renting out both residential and commercial property.Although we have used our own money on occasion to finance ourpurchases and renovations, we’ve primarily succeeded with theuse of other people’s money (OPM). Our grandmothers were ourfirst financial backers, but we’ve expanded our options since then.03_422335-intro.qxp  3/11/09  11:50 AM  Page 1We have more than 50 years’ worth of combined experience in
buying and selling real estate and securing the financing to do it. Inthis book, we share what we know with you, showing you how totap into loans from banks; mortgage companies; private lenders;federal, state, and local government programs; and more. In theprocess we cover financing for both residential and commercialproperties.
Conventions Used in This Book
Compared to other books on financing real estate investments,
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies is anything but con-
ventional, but we do use some conventions to call your attention
to certain items. For example:
/H12012Italics highlight new, somewhat technical terms, such as hard
money, and emphasize words when we’re driving home a
point.
/H12012Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted and numbered
lists.
/H12012Monofont highlights Web addresses.
Financing the purchase and renovation of residential properties,
such as homes, is quite different from financing the purchase andrenovation of commercial properties. You deal with differentlenders who use different methods for evaluating your loan appli-cation and the property you’re planning to buy.
In this book, we cover both types of financing, but you should
know up front the differences between residential and commercialproperty:
/H12012Residential: One- to four-family dwellings classify as residen-
tial properties, which qualify for residential financing.
/H12012Commercial: Properties used to conduct business and any
rental properties designed to house more than four families
qualify as commercial real estate. Loan approval for theseproperties hinges more on the property’s potential for gener-ating sufficient income to make the payments than on the bor-rower’s financial strength.
In addition, even though you see three author names on the coverof this book — Chip, Ralph, and Joe — the “we” is usually Chip andRalph talking. Joe is the wordsmith — the guy responsible forFinancing Real Estate Investments For Dummies 203_422335-intro.qxp  3/11/09  11:50 AM  Page 2keeping you engaged and entertained and making sure weexplain
everything as clearly and thoroughly as possible.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we encourage you to read this book from cover to cover
to maximize the return on your investment, we realize that intoday’s busy world you may have time to read only the informationpertinent to your situation. If so, you can safely skip anything yousee in a gray shaded box. We stuck this material in a box for thesame reason that most people stick stuff in boxes — to get it out ofthe way, so you wouldn’t trip over it. However, you may find thestories and brief asides uproariously funny and perhaps evenmildly informative (or vice versa).
Foolish Assumptions
We assume you already mastered the basics of investing in real
estate. If you haven’t, we encourage you to pick up a copy of either(or both) 
Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric
Tyson and Robert S. Griswold, or Commercial Real Estate Investing
For Dummies by Peter Conti and Peter Harris (Wiley).
If you’re interested in flipping houses or focusing on foreclosure
properties, check out Flipping Houses For Dummies or Foreclosure
Investing For Dummies by Ralph R. Roberts with Joe Kraynak. If
you’re thinking of becoming a landlord, we strongly encourage you
to first read Property Management For Dummies by Robert S.
Griswold. Not everyone has the right stuff to be a landlord, but if
you know what you’re getting into before you take on the role, youcan significantly improve your survival odds.
How This Book Is Organized
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies facilitates a skip-
and-dip approach. It presents the information in easily digestible
chunks, so you can skip to the chapter or section that grabs yourattention or meets your current needs, master it, and then skip toanother section or simply set the book aside for later reference.
To help you navigate, we took the 17 chapters that make up the
book and divvied them up into five parts. Here, we provide a quickoverview of what we cover in each part.Introduction 303_422335-intro.qxp  3/11/09  11:50 AM  Page 3Part I: Gearing Up for Financing
Your Real Estate Investments
When you become a real estate investor, you’re essentially building
a business; you should build it on a strong foundation.

rently available, show you how to compare different loan packagesto find the one that costs the least overall, and lead you throughthe loan application process from filling out the forms to closing.
By the end of this part, you should have the financing you need to
start hunting for residential real estate investment opportunities.
Part III: Financing the Purchase 
of Commercial Properties
In this part, we introduce you to the most common commercial
property types, so you can choose the type best suited to yourinvestment goals and evaluate the properties based on their poten-tial for generating a positive cash flow. We take you on a tour ofsome of the unique sources of financing available for commercialventures. Finally, we step you through the process of applying forcommercial real estate loans from application to closing.
Part IV: Sampling More Creative
Financing Strategies
In this part, you discover the pros and cons of hard money — cash
that’s generally easier but more expensive to borrow for purchasingFinancing Real Estate Investments For Dummies 403_422335-intro.qxp  3/11/09  11:50 AM  Page 4investment properties. We also show you how to finance the pur-
chase through the seller by purchasing properties on contract,how to partner with an investor who’s cash heavy, and how totrack down no-money-down deals.
These options aren’t for everybody, but when you’re in the market
for investment properties and can’t get your hands on conven-tional financing, these unconventional sources can be a deal saver.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is the highlight of every For Dummies title, offer-
ing quick strategies, tips, and insights on whatever subject the
book covers. The chapters in this Part of Tens reveal how to avoidthe ten most common mistakes when financing real estate invest-ments, which questions you should ask prospective lenders, tensteps to take to prepare for your next closing, and ten strategiesfor surviving a credit crunch.

Where to Go From Here
Financing Real Estate Investments For Dummies is sort of like an
information kiosk. You can start with the chapters in Part I to
master the basics and then skip to Part II if you’re planning onfinancing the purchase of residential property or Part III if yourfocus is more on commercial properties.Introduction 503_422335-intro.qxp  3/11/09  11:50 AM  Page 5For a quick primer on financing the purchase of real estate invest-
ments, check out Chapter 1. Chapter 4 is a great place to start ifyou’re not sure where to start looking for lenders — this chaptertouches on everything from banks and mortgage companies to pri-vate lenders and partnering with others who have cash.
We do consider Chapter 6 required reading. All too often investors
get burned because they focus too much on interest rates and noton other factors contributing to the overall cost of borrowingmoney. This chapter offers a quick way to compare two loans side-by-side to determine which one costs less over the life of the loan.
If you’re planning to invest in commercial properties, Chapter 8 is
also required reading. In this chapter, we show you how to evalu-ate different types of properties the way lenders do it when youapply for a loan.

Here, we provide a quick primer on real estate financing along with

Power with Borrowed Money
If you have any reservations about borrowing money to buy real
estate, you need to overcome those reservations by developing abetter understanding of leverage — using borrowed money to buymore and better properties, thus improving your chances of earn-ing bigger profits.
In the following sections, we show you why the goal of owning a
property free and clear isn’t such a smart move, reveal the secretof leveraging the power of borrowed money, and explain how youcan offer “cash” for properties even when financing the purchase.
Although we encourage investors to borrow money to increase
their leverage, keep in mind that borrowing money can carry signif-icant risks. As an investor, you can take action to minimize therisks — by carefully evaluating your real estate market and proper-ties under consideration, overestimating costs, underestimatingprofits, developing realistic backup plans, and so on; however youcan never completely eliminate the risk. You have to decide foryourself what an acceptable level of risk is.
Minimizing your potential by owning
property free and clear
For many Americans, paying off their mortgage early and owning
their home free and clear is the real American dream. Life would beso much better if they didn’t have to deal with a house payment.
For real estate investors, however, owning property free and clear
means that valuable equity is locked up in those properties —equity they can use to finance the purchase of other revenue-generating real estate. Don’t get caught in the trap of thinking thatpaying off a mortgage loan is a smart move — it may be a noblegoal, but it’s rarely a savvy strategy.
Maximizing your potential 
with other people’s money
Other people’s money (or OPM for short) is money that you borrow
from other people to finance your investments. OPM isn’t much of
a secret. Assuming you own a home, you probably used OPM tobuy it. You may have put down 5 to 10 percent of your own moneyas a down payment and then borrowed the rest.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 1005_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 10In most cases, OPM helps you earn a profit. When you calculate in
the appreciation of the home, the tax savings it represents, infla-tion, and other factors, you’re likely to earn more money off thehome than you pay out in interest over the life of the loan — barring a major housing meltdown.
The same applies to your real estate investments. The more OPM
you can put to work for you, the more you stand to earn — as longas your earnings from it exceed the cost of borrowing it. For moreinfo about OPM, check out Chapter 5.
Paying cash with borrowed money
In the world of real estate, cash is king. The buyer who shows up
with cash is in a significantly stronger position to purchase a prop-erty and negotiate an attractive price and terms than a buyer whoshows up needing financing.Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 11
Dealing with a major credit crunch
The mortgage meltdown, foreclosure epidemic, and global financial crisis that all
came to a head in 2008 led many real estate investors to believe that credit had allbut dried up. Banks were failing left and right, and the United States was forced tostep in with more than $1 trillion in economic rescue funds to keep cash flowing toindividuals and businesses that needed credit. Surely, real estate investors wouldbe the last on the list for cheap and easy credit.
Actually, the credit crunch didn’t put real estate investors out of business. In fact,
in many cases, it made conditions better for investors:
/H12012When the bubble burst, properties became much more affordable. Investors
could buy better properties for less money.
/H12012As millions of people worked through foreclosure, demand for rental properties
soared.
/H12012Financial institutions, eager to rid their books of empty, expensive, cash-sucking
foreclosures, became more willing to offer great deals. I (Chip) just had a clientpay $82,000 for a brand new property with a market value of about $275,000. Thebank had taken it back from a builder, was more than glad to just get it off thebooks, and was willing to finance it with a 15-year loan.
A credit crunch doesn’t mean that financing disappears — it just means that youprobably need to look for it in some unusual places. Even FHA has investor financ-ing with 25 percent down — and a lot of foreclosures they’re willing to deal on.Throughout this book, we show you how to tap into these markets — credit crunchand all.05_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 11When we say cash is king, however, we’re not advising you to show
up with a suitcase full of money. We’re telling you to show up withpreapproved financing — a financial backer who can deliver thecash on closing day. In other words, although you’re financing thepurchase as explained throughout this book, you’re still placingyourself in a position to offer cash.
Brushing Up on Basic Real 
Estate Financing Lingo
Throughout this book, we toss around some jargon common in the
real estate and mortgage lending industries. To the average con-sumer, these terms may sound Greek, but we assure you thatthey’re part of the English language. In the following sections, wedefine the most common and often misunderstood of these terms.
Identifying types of lenders
The moneymen and -women you deal with when securing financing
for purchasing investment property play various roles in theprocess. You need to know whom you’re working with:
/H12012Commercial lenders: They’re financial institutions rather
than individuals. They include banks, credit unions, mutual
savings banks, savings and loan associations, and stock sav-ings banks. (Chapter 9 discusses commercial lenders ingreater detail.)
/H12012Private lenders: A private lender is any individual who loans
money outside the channels of institutional lending. This
person can be a friend or relative, such as your Aunt Mabel,or an investor. Real estate investors often rely on privatelenders for access to investment capital when banks andother financial institutions turn them down. (For more aboutprivate lenders, check out Chapter 11.)
/H12012Mortgage banker: Mortgage bankers are financial institutions
that directly fund home loans and either service those loans
themselves (arranging and collecting monthly payments andmanaging any escrow accounts) or sell the mortgages toinvestors and contract out the servicing of the loans.
/H12012Servicer: The servicer is the institution contracted or
appointed to collect the monthly payments from the bor-
rower. They have to account for all payments and disburse-ments and provide yearly statements showing all transactionswithin a mortgage account to the borrower.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 1205_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 12/H12012Mortgage broker: Mortgage brokers are licensed by the state
to assist borrowers in finding mortgage lenders, comparing
loan programs, applying for mortgage loans, and securingfinancing for purchasing real estate. They act as the eyes andears for many different mortgage lenders.
/H12012Loan officer: Loan officers work for mortgage bankers or bro-
kers to assist clients in securing financing for purchasing real
estate. They essentially do the same thing brokers do, butthey have to work for a licensed broker or lender.
/H12012Loan originator: Another name for a mortgage broker or loan
officer.
See Chapter 4 for more on these types of lenders.
Grasping different loan types
Throughout this book, we introduce you to various types of loans
for financing the purchase of real estate, including conforming andnonconforming loans, jumbo loans, and hard money loans. In thefollowing list, we define the most common loan types and toss insome additional information that you may find useful.
/H12012Conforming loan: A conforming loan is one that meets the cri-
teria set forth by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac — the organiza-
tions that purchase the loans and then package them up tosell on Wall Street. In general, to qualify for a conforming loan,the borrower must
• Show sufficient income to cover monthly payments.
• Have enough cash for a down payment and reserves.• Have a good credit history.
For additional details about conforming loans and current cri-
teria, visit the Fannie Mae Web site at 
www.efanniemae.com .
/H12012Nonconforming loans: These include everything else outside
the Fannie/Freddie box. Sometimes referred to in the market
as subprime or even exotic loans, they’re bought by other
financial companies or investment banks and packaged to be
sold to Wall Street investors. When the subprime market suf-fers, as it did starting in 2008, far fewer of these types of secu-rities make it to market.
/H12012Conventional loans: These loans are outside the sphere 
of the government. In other words, they’re not FHA- or VA-
secured loans and aren’t underwritten by any governmentagency.Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 1305_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 13/H12012Jumbo loans: As its name suggests, a jumbo loan represents a
lot of money — specifically, more money than you can borrow
under the limits of a conforming loan.
/H12012Hard money loans: Also referred to as bridge loans , they’re
typically short-term, high-interest loans that enable investors
to get their mitts on some cash in a hurry. You can expect topay several points upfront (a 
point is equivalent to one per-
cent of the total loan amount) plus up to double the going
interest rate. (For more about hard money and strategies forusing it to your advantage, check out Chapter 11.)
/H12012Government loan programs: The government isn’t really in the
business of loaning money to homeowners and investors, but 
it facilitates the process for lenders by insuring the loans — ifthe borrower defaults on the loan, the government steps in tocover any losses for the lender.
The two most common government loan programs are Federal
Housing Authority (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA)loans. But federal, state, and local governments also provideloan programs to encourage investment in disaster areas andneighborhoods that they’re seeking to develop. Within theFHA and VA programs are some great hidden opportunities forinvestors. (See Chapter 4 for more about specific governmentloan programs.)
Brushing up on important legal lingo
Even though real estate deals are generally classified as financial,
they involve plenty of legalities, especially in relation to who ownsthe property or has a stake in it. Although real estate–related legalterms can fill an entire dictionary, you should have a workingknowledge of the following three:
/H12012Deed: A deed is a legal document that grants rights to a prop-
erty. Whenever you purchase a property, whoever is handling
the closing must file the deed with the county’s register ofdeeds to make the transfer of ownership official. As the offi-cial owner, you have the right to borrow against the propertyand transfer your rights of ownership.
Be careful signing any deed, especially a 
quitclaim deed (the
deed that allows a property’s owner to relinquish all rights to
the property). Real estate con artists often use the quitclaimdeed to hijack property from unwary owners. They may hidea single page quitclaim deed in a stack of papers, fooling theowner into signing the document without knowing whatthey’re signing. Then, they run down to the register of deedsand file the deed, making themselves the new owners, so theycan take out bogus loans against the property.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 1405_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 14/H12012Lien: A lienis a legal claim that a creditor holds against a
property in lieu of payment. Several parties can place a lien
on a property, including the lender who holds any first orsecond mortgage, the county tax assessor (for unpaid taxes),and contractors (if they financed the repairs or renovations).
As an investor, knowing who (if anyone) has a lien against a
property you’re purchasing and the monetary value of thatlien is important. All lien holders need to be paid in full uponsale of the property. If the property has a lien against it thatthe seller fails to disclose, you may become liable for paying itwhen you take ownership of the property.
/H12012Promissory note: Whenever you borrow money, you have to
sign a promissory note pledging to pay back the loan in full
according to terms of the loan, which always specifies a dead-line for full payment. Think of a promissory note as an IOU (asin “I owe you” this amount of money).
The promissory note is your pledge to pay back the loan. The
mortgage or deed of trust names the property as collateral inthe event that you default on the loan.Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 15
Who gets first dibs?
In the event of a foreclosure, certain liens take precedence over others, meaning
that when the property is sold at auction, certain lien holders are paid off first:
/H12012Tax lien: The proceeds from the foreclosure sale pay off any unpaid property
taxes first.
/H12012First mortgage: If any money from the proceeds of the sale remain, it pays off
the first mortgage or as much of the first mortgage as possible. This is also
referred to as a senior lien.
/H12012Second mortgage: If the homeowner took out a second mortgage, any remain-
ing proceeds from the sale go toward paying it off. Any second (or third or
fourth) mortgages are also referred to as junior liens .
/H12012Construction liens: If money still remains, it goes to the next lien holders in order
of precedence.
/H12012Homeowners: After all the lien holders receive their cuts, the foreclosed-upon
homeowners get the remaining crumbs, which can actually be quite a chunk of
change if they had a lot of equity in the property.05_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 15Pointing out mortgage concepts
When you take out a loan, the lender requires something of value
(collateral) to make sure it has something valuable to sell and
recoup its investment if you default on the loan. This collateral is
officially presented in the form of a mortgage or deed of trustdepending on the jurisdiction:
/H12012Mortgage: A mortgage is a contract between the lender and
borrower that gives the lender the right to foreclose on the
property in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan.
/H12012Deed of trust: A deed of trust is a mortgage contract that
places control of the deed in the hands of a third party — a
trustee. The trustee has the power to foreclose on the prop-erty in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan.
The mortgage market is large and complex, but it consists of twomain divisions: a 
primary and a secondary mortgage market.
/H12012Primary: This is the market in which you do business. It con-
sists of financial institutions that lend you money.
/H12012Secondary: This is the market where institutional lenders and
Wall Street investors converge. The primary lenders who actu-
ally loan money to homeowners and investors turn aroundand sell the mortgages or deeds of trust to investors. Thisgives the lenders more money to make available to borrowers.
Examining equity
Equity is the amount of money you’d have if you sold the property
today and paid off the balance due on the loan. More importantly,
as an investor, you can pull equity out of a property by borrowingagainst it. This power enables you to put that equity to work foryou in other investments.
Thanks to the credit crisis in 2008 and 2009, the equity require-
ments to obtain financing are growing. Lenders are taking a closerlook at market values, especially in what they call 
declining areas —
areas showing a pattern of recently declining housing values. As an
investor, you should be doing the same thing. Be cautious whencalculating equity positions and profit margins.
Although we encourage investors to tap the power of equity, keep-
ing some equity in a property (especially the home you own) is agood idea. Having equity to borrow against in the event of a finan-cial setback may save you from foreclosure and bankruptcy.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 1605_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 16Looking at loan-to-value (LTV)
The loan-to-value (L TV) is the ratio of the total loan amount to 
the value of the property. If you’re buying a $200,000 home with
$40,000 down and applying for a $160,000 loan, the L TV would be
$160,000 ÷ $200,000 = 80 percent
Generally speaking, lenders want to see lower L TVs for investmentproperties than for homes because a lower L TV provides more of abuffer to cover the increased risks inherent in investment proper-ties. Check out Chapter 3 for more about calculating the L TV andhow lenders use this number to evaluate risk.
Distinguishing Investment 
and Home Financing
Your first real estate investment should be your own home. In fact,
if you don’t own your home, we advise you to put down this bookand pick up a copy of 
Home Buying For Dummies by Eric Tyson and
Ray Brown (Wiley) first. Owning your own home carries the least
risk and the most potential tax benefits while bringing you up tospeed on the basics of real estate investing and ownership.
After you’ve purchased a home, you should have a fairly good
understanding of the mortgage loan application and approvalprocess. (We provide a refresher course in Chapter 7.) However,real estate financing differs quite a bit when you take on the role ofinvestor rather than homeowner. You and the lender take on morerisk. As a result, you can expect to pay more for the privilege ofborrowing money. In addition, your borrowing strategy is likely tochange. In the following sections, we cover these differences ingreater detail, so you know what to expect before diving in.
Paying a premium for riskier 
investment loans
When you invest in your own home, you literally have a vested
interest in making payments — if you don’t, you lose the roof overyour head. On the flip side, if you lose an investment property, itmay be painful, but it’s never 
thatserious, and lenders are well
aware of the difference. For them, investment loans are riskier
propositions. To mitigate the risk, they generallyChapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 1705_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 17/H12012Require a larger down payment.
/H12012Demand a larger loan-to-value ratio. (See “Looking at loan to
value (L TV)” earlier in this chapter.)
/H12012Charge more interest upfront in the form of points.
/H12012Charge a higher interest rate.
/H12012Require proof that you have reserves or liquid assets available
in case things don’t go as planned.
The actions that lenders take to mitigate the risks and the interest
rates and fees they charge vary greatly depending on the borrowerand the deal that’s on the table. Just make sure you have all thedocumentation and figures ready when you meet with your lenderfor the first time, as explained in Chapter 3.
Using quick cash to 
snag bargain prices
When you’re shopping for a mortgage to buy a home for your
family, you’re usually looking for a low-interest package, no or veryfew points, and attractive terms. With investment properties, 
cash
flow trumps interest rate. In other words, access to cash is often
more important than the cost of the loan. To find out more about
the relative importance of cash flow and how to shop for loanswith the lowest interest rates and fees, see Chapter 6.
If the numbers work, what you pay in interest doesn’t matter.
Interest is just another expense. If you subtract all your expensesand can still earn the profit you want, paying thousands of dollarsin interest over a relatively short period is acceptable.
Accounting for taxes on your 
capital gains (or losses)
When buying and selling a primary residence, you don’t have to
think too much about the tax ramifications of the transactions. Inthe United States, a huge chunk of any profit you earn from the saleis usually tax exempt — up to $250,000 if you own the home your-self or double that if you and your spouse sell the home.
However, when you’re selling investment real estate, any profits
are subject to capital gains taxes. During the writing of this book,profits from real estate investments were taxed as follows:Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 1805_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 18/H12012Long-term capital gains: 15 percent if you hold the property
for at least a year and a day.
/H12012Short-term capital gains: 35 percent if you sell the property in
fewer than 12 months from the date you purchased it.
/H12012Income tax: If profits from investing in real estate are your
sole income, the IRS may consider it your job and tax your
profits as income, complete with an additional 15 percent inself-employment tax.
We’re not tax experts. Consult a CPA who has experience dealingwith real estate investors for details on how the government isgoing to tax your profits and for suggestions on how to reduceyour tax burden. Your measure of success isn’t how much yougross but how much you net. By reducing your tax bill, you can sig-nificantly increase your net gain.
Protecting your personal assets
Just like most things worth doing, real estate investing exposes
you to risk. Perhaps the biggest risk is that you’re working withborrowed money from lenders who expect you to pay it back. Ifyou make a lousy investment decision or an investment goes belly-up despite your best efforts, lenders are going to do everythinglegally possible to collect their money.
You also face the ever-present risk of litigation — having a dis-
agreement with a buyer, seller, tenant, contractor, or someone elsethat eventually leads to a costly lawsuit.
Eliminating risk isn’t possible, but you can take several measures
to lessen the risk, including operating through an LLC, transferringpersonal assets to someone else, or having a qualified attorneycover your back. Check out Chapter 2 for more details.
Exploring Common Sources 
of Investment Capital
You probably picked up this book because you want to start
investing in real estate, but you don’t know where to dig up thecash to do your first deal. In the following sections, we show youwhere to start digging.Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 1905_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 19Tapping your own cash reserves
If you’re single, or you and your significant other are on the same
page about this real estate investing thing, cracking into your nestegg to finance your investments may be the quickest way to getyour fingers on some investment capital.
It’s also the riskiest option, because if anything goes wrong — you
get laid off or fired, become too ill to work, or encounter unex-pected expenses — you have fewer reserves to keep you afloat. Inaddition, limiting yourself to your own resources also limits yourpurchase power — you have to buy houses in a lower price rangeand may not have sufficient cash to properly renovate the property.
A great way to ruin a relationship is to bet the farm on big profits
without the knowledge and complete agreement of your spouse orsignificant other. If your investment doesn’t pan out (and even if itdoes), the other person may take offense at not being consulted.
Even with these caveats, many beginning investors have gotten
their start by financing their own ventures — partially or in full.And you want to know about these resources if you need somequick cash in a pinch.
Clearing out your bank accounts
Having a few thousand dollars socked away in a savings account is
always a good idea, just in case you run into a cash flow problem. Ifthat house you bought and fixed up is taking a few months longerthan expected to sell, your little nest egg can help cover the pay-ments until you find a buyer.
Use your savings as a reserve, not as your main mode of financing.
Having some cash to fall back on can save you in a pinch.
Borrowing against the equity in your home
As your home’s value rises and you pay down the principal, you
build equity. You can often borrow against this equity by taking outa home equity loan or line of credit and then use the money forwhatever you want, including purchasing other real estate. Therecent credit crisis has made it harder to find these loans, butthey’re still out there for well-qualified borrowers.
We don’t recommend that you cash out all the equity in your
home, but if you have a substantial amount of equity, cashing out aportion of it can help you come up with a down payment or coverthe cost of repairs and renovations. (For more about home equityloans and lines of credit, skip to Chapter 11.)Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 2005_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 20Financing investments through a self-directed IRA
More and more investors are choosing to set up self-directed IRAs
and other types of retirement accounts that enable them to invest
in real estate rather than in stocks and bonds. The reasoning: Realestate often provides a better and sometimes even more securereturn on your investment.
With a self-directed IRA, you can buy and sell properties out of
your retirement account. Setting up a self-directed IRA, however, isno simple matter. Typically, a trust company manages the moneyand properties in the account, and all profits and losses from yourinvestments must stay in that account. Withdrawing money fromthe account results in the same IRS penalties you have to pay ifyou withdraw money from any type of retirement account.
Consult your financial advisor and accountant for details about
using a self-directed IRA to finance your real estate investments. Ifa self-directed IRA isn’t an option, you may be able to borrowmoney against your retirement account. Keep in mind, however,that borrowing against your retirement savings places those sav-ings at risk, as does any other investment.
Charging expenses on your credit cards
Maxing out your credit cards to purchase a car, clothes, electron-
ics, groceries, and other items that provide no return on yourinvestment is never a good idea. Using your credit cards to pur-chase investment properties that offer a solid, relatively quickreturn on your investment, however, can be a savvy (though risky)financial move.
Consider credit cards a last resort to cover the costs of repairs and
renovations if financing is tight near the end of a project. With thisstrategy, your investment activities can directly affect your per-sonal finances, which increases your exposure to risk. For moreabout this option, check out Chapter 11.
Borrowing from commercial lenders
One of the best ways to finance the purchase of investment proper-
ties is to meet with a qualified mortgage broker who can help youfind and evaluate various loan programs. These plans are oftenyour best deals — costing the least in upfront fees and interest.
For more about finding commercial lenders, check out Chapter 4. If
you’re investing in residential property, Chapter 5 reveals the vari-ous residential loan programs to choose from. If you’re buyingcommercial property, turn to Chapter 9 for guidance on choosingthe right loan program.Chapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 2105_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 21Don’t confuse “commercial property” with “commercial lender.” A
commercial property is any property that isn’t a one- to four-family
residential dwelling. A commercial lender is an institution (as
opposed to an individual) that loans money. In other words, you
can use a commercial lender to finance the purchase of residentialinvestment property.
Obtaining a hard money loan
When banks and other financial institutions turn down your
requests for investment capital (or you don’t have the time to con-vince them that a deal is pure gold), consider borrowing moneyfrom a hard money lender, as explained in Chapter 11.
One of the main advantages of a hard money lender is that the
person is likely to accept the property you’re buying as all the col-lateral needed to secure the loan, so you don’t have to place yourhome at risk.
Financing your purchase 
through the seller
Property owners who are eager to sell and don’t need all the cash
at once are often willing to finance the purchase themselves. Thistactic enables them to profit in two ways — by selling you theproperty for more than they paid for it and collecting interest fromyou. Seller financing take either of the following forms:
/H12012Land contract: A land contract is like a mortgage, except the
seller acts as the bank.
/H12012Lease option agreement: A lease option agreement is like a
rent-to-own deal — you lease the property for a specified
period, at the end of which time you have the option to buy it.
For more about seller financing, check out Chapter 12.
Taking on a partner
Whenever you don’t have something (like money, skills, time, or
talent) to accomplish a particular goal, you can acquire those skills, buy or hire them, or create a partnership with someone whoalready has what you need. If you have something someone elseneeds and they have what you need, you have what it takes to forma mutually beneficial relationship. For details on how to partnerwith someone who has the cash you need, check out Chapter 13.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 2205_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 22Choose a partner as carefully as you choose a spouse. Partnerships
often end when one person scams the other or disagreements ariseover who’s putting more into the projects and who’s getting moreout of them. Have your attorney write up a contract, complete witha prenuptial type agreement stating how all the assets will bedivvied up in the event that you part company.
Prepping to Meet with a Lender
Walk into a bank empty-handed and explain to the loan officer that
you need a loan to start investing in real estate, and we can almostguarantee that you’ll be laughed out the door. Before you eventhink about meeting with a prospective lender, get all your ducks ina row. Copy all the financial documents lenders are going to ask forand construct a fairly detailed plan on how you’re going to profitby investing in real estate. This section gives you an overview ofwhat you need to do before visiting your lender. Chapter 4 pro-vides complete in-depth info.
Gathering paperwork and other info
Before approving your request for a loan, lenders want to know
whether you’re good for the money — how likely you are to makethe monthly payments and pay back the loan in full. For investors,this means two things:
/H12012You’re in pretty good financial shape right now and have a
fairly clean credit history.
/H12012The property you’re planning to buy is more than worth the
money you’re borrowing to pay for it, and (if you’re going tobe renting out the property) it will generate sufficient incometo more than cover all your expenses along with the monthlypayments.
To verify your creditworthiness for yourself and be sure you haveall the documents and other information your lender requires, stuffa folder full of a copy of each of the following items:
/H12012Credit reports from all three credit reporting agencies
/H12012A net worth statement (assets – liabilities = net worth)
/H12012A debt ratio statement (ratio of what you owe to what 
you own)
/H12012Last two months’ bank statements
/H12012Last 30 days’ pay stubsChapter 1: Taking a Crash Course in Real Estate Investment Financing 2305_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 23/H12012Last two years’ federal tax returns and schedules
/H12012Statements of any business income
/H12012Appraisal or comparative market analysis for the property
/H12012Cash flow analysis of the property
/H12012Loan-to-value ratio of the property
/H12012Zoning information for the property’s location
/H12012City and county records for the property
Crafting a business plan
Real estate investors often scoff at the idea of creating a business
plan — a detailed presentation that shows how an investor plans
to purchase a specific property and earn a profit from it. Investors
often just want to buy and sell and rent out property and make alot of money — that’s the plan. They don’t like to think of them-selves as pencil-necked pencil pushers. If they feel in their gut thata property is a solid investment, that’s good enough for them.
At least that’s the false image that many people have of investors.
The most successful investors, however, do the math. They crunchthe numbers. And if the numbers don’t work, they don’t do the deal.
Do your homework. Do a comparative market analysis of the prop-
erty to make sure it’s worth what you think it’s worth. If you’rebuying rental property, check the rental history of the property —the owner’s tax records showing income and expenses. Craft abusiness plan showing exactly how this property is going to be arevenue generator.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 2405_422335-ch01.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 24Chapter 2
Shielding Your Personal
Assets from Investment Risks
In This Chapter
/H17075Grasping the need to cover your assets
/H17075Investing as a corporation to reduce your exposure to risk
/H17075Assigning ownership of certain assets to others
/H17075Avoiding collateral and cross-collateral damage
/H17075Dodging real estate and mortgage fraud
Funny thing about lenders — when you borrow money from
them, they expect you to pay it back. To ensure repayment of
a loan, the lender usually requires that you sign a promissory noteand a mortgage or deed of trust. The 
promissory note is your per-
sonal promise to repay the loan in full. The mortgage or deed of
trust names certain property as collateral for the loan.
If you happen to default on the loan (fail to make payments as stip-
ulated), the lender has the right to foreclose (sell your property to
the highest bidder). If the lender can’t sell the property for at least
as much as you owe on it, it may be able to sue you for the differ-ence 
(deficiency) in jurisdictions that allow deficiency judgments.
As an investor, you want to limit the assets that the lender has the
right to seize in lieu of payment. If you fail to make payments on aloan you took out to purchase an investment property, for exam-ple, you want to make sure that the bank can’t take possession ofthe home you live in, other businesses you own, or other assets,such as your car. To prevent the lender from going after personalassets and other business assets as payment, you need to 
shield
those assets — keep them legally and financially separate from
your investment properties. In this chapter, you discover variousstrategies for doing just that.06_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 25It’s a jungle out there. Fraud is more common in the real estate
industry than most professionals are willing to admit, so in thischapter, we also show you how to protect yourself against becominga victim or unwitting accomplice to real estate and mortgage fraud.
Understanding Why You Need to
Protect Your Personal Assets
As an investor, you’re a small-business owner, but you’re also an
individual who may have a spouse and a family to support. Youprobably have a home, a car, one or more personal bank accounts,a retirement account, and other valuables that you’ve worked veryhard for a long time to accumulate. You want to build even morewealth by investing in real estate, and you’re willing to take somerisks, but can you live with losing everything you now own?
The correct answer is (or should be) “no.” No, you shouldn’t risk
everything you now own to invest in real estate. Why? We canthink of two very good reasons:
/H12012You don’t want to or have to risk everything. You can protect
some or all your assets from risk by following the advice weoffer in this chapter.
/H12012If your investment goes belly up, you can recover much more
quickly and perhaps even pursue future investments by hold-ing on to more of your current assets.
In any investment, you should try to limit your exposure (bothfinancially and emotionally) to the individual deal. You’re investingyour time and talent and perhaps a little of your own money. Inaddition, you’re the one who’s taking on the burden of managingthe project, dealing with hassles, and worrying about whether yourinvestment is going to eventually turn a profit. All the lender isdoing is putting up the money, so let the lender step up to the plateand take the 
financial risk. That’s the price it pays for being able to
do business with you.
Limiting Your Personal Liability 
by Forming an LLC
Businesses form corporations for any number of reasons, but one
of the primary reasons is to establish the business as a separateentity. If, for example, you do business in your own name, youbecome personally liable for anything that happens in the coursePart I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 2606_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 26of doing business. If someone decides to sue you over something
related to your business, all your personal belongings are at stake.
By setting up a corporation, you essentially create a fall guy who
takes the blame if something terrible happens. A customer can sueyour corporation to the point of bankruptcy, and in most cases,you can simply walk away with your home, your car, and your per-sonal savings and belongings all intact.
One of the best and most popular corporate entities for real estate
investors is the 
limited liability company or LLC. By forming an LLC,
you limit your exposure to risk to the company, so it can fold with-
out negatively affecting your personal finances.
In the following sections, we provide guidelines on setting up an
LLC and managing your investments through it. For details aboutcreating and managing an LLC, check out 
Limited Liability
Companies For Dummies by Jennifer Reuting (Wiley).
Understanding the pros and cons
On its surface, an LLC appears to be the best of all possible busi-
ness entities, and in some ways it really is, but prior to taking theplunge, consider its potential advantages and disadvantages. 
An LLC offers the following benefits:
/H12012Generally requires less paperwork and fewer hassles: Small
business owners who form S-corps often get frustrated pre-
tending that they’re some huge corporation — filing all sortsof forms, holding or pretending to hold corporate meetings,and keeping a record of each meeting’s minutes. With an LLC,you avoid most of that nonsense — at least the meetings andthe minutes.
/H12012Provides greater protection: Operating as a sole proprietor-
ship leaves you completely vulnerable to lawsuits and other
legal claims against your personal assets. An LLC provides thesame sort of protection you can expect under the corporateumbrella.
/H12012Allows you to dodge the passive income bullet: If too much
of your income from real estate holdings is classified as pas-
sive, the IRS could convert your Sub-S into a C-corp (a regular
corporation), exposing you to double taxation. With an LLC,
you can do a pass-through, in which your real estate earnings
pass through the company and are treated as personal
income so that the company isn’t taxed separately, as well.Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 2706_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 27Although an LLC offers the protection of limited liability, it does
have a couple of its own limitations, as well:
/H12012If a member of the LLC dies or goes bankrupt, the LLC is dis-
solved, whereas a corporation can continue to exist as long asit has shareholders.
/H12012All properties within the LLC are exposed to risks associated
with the other properties held in the same LLC. In otherwords, someone trying to collect money for one of the LLC’sproperties can go after the other properties to collect pay-ment. For this reason, limiting the number of properties heldin any one LLC is a good idea.
Setting up an LLC
Anyone with a free weekend, a computer, and an Internet connection
can set up an LLC (although we recommend that you use an attor-ney). You download the forms, fill them out, and submit them toyour state commerce department, secretary of state, or bureau ofcorporations. Although each state has slightly different proceduresto follow and forms to complete, you should be able to find all theinstructions and documents you need on your state’s Web site.
Go to your favorite online search engine and type in “corporation”
followed by the name of your state — for example, “corporationArizona” (without the quotation marks). This search should bringup a link to the department in your state that handles LLCs andcorporations.
You can set up most LLCs on your own for very little expense and
paperwork, but we encourage you to consult with an attorney. Asavvy attorney can ensure you’ve set up your corporate shield in away that makes it less vulnerable to being pierced. You may alsowant to hire an accountant to manage the finances for the com-pany and ensure that any taxes that come due are paid on time.
The choice of which state you form your corporation in is of
utmost importance, especially in terms of how you’re taxed.Delaware, for example, is very corporation-friendly, which is whyyou see so many financial institutions, especially credit card com-panies, centered in Delaware. Discuss the options with youraccountant and attorney.
Taking and securing title to real estate
When you have an LLC in place, perform all business transactions
in the name of the LLC rather than in your own name. WhetherPart I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 2806_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 28you’re taking out a loan, signing a purchase agreement, or putting
your John Hancock on closing papers, make sure your LLC is listedas the responsible party and that you’re signing as a representativeof the company.
Accomplishing this task is fairly easy on your part because other
people are usually in charge of drawing up the paperwork. All youneed to do is instruct the person (real estate agent, closing agent,loan officer, or whoever is handling the paperwork) to prepare it inthe name of the LLC.
Unfortunately, on conventional loans with conventional lenders for
typical one- to four-family dwellings, getting a loan in the name ofthe LLC is nearly impossible, but you can still have the LLC 
hold the
property, providing some protection from personal liability. You
have an easier time taking loans out in the name of the LLC whenpurchasing larger properties (5+ units) and commercial deals.
If you can’t take title in the name of your LLC, move the property
into the LLC as soon as practical. You can do this by using a 
quit-
claim deed — typically a one-page legal document that enables you
to deed the property to another individual or business entity. You
simply sign the quitclaim deed, specifying that the LLC is the newdeed holder, and then file the quitclaim deed with your county’sregister of deeds. Your attorney can supply you with a quitclaimdeed that’s valid in your county.
Follow your attorney’s advice carefully, because this strategy can
trigger a 
due-on-sale clause, in which case you would need to pay
back the loan in full immediately. The IRS allows investors to trans-
fer real estate for estate-planning purposes, so you’re in the clearas long as you follow the rules.
Some LLCs choose to perform certain transactions under an
assumed name — a name that differs from that of the company. We
strongly discourage the use of assumed names in real estate trans-
actions, because they provide little, if any, protection for you.Always transact your investment business under the LLC’s name.
Eyeing Sub-S corporations 
and partnerships
Although we recommend LLCs for most investors, a Subchapter S
corporation (or Sub-S for short) is a viable alternative. A Sub-S isan actual 
corporation (as opposed to a company ) that chooses not
to pay taxes on earnings but instead have those earnings pass
through to the shareholders so they pay taxes on them. It’sChapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 2906_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 29another way of dodging the double-taxation bullet (taxing the cor-
poration as well as the individual shareholders). 
A Sub-S can also provide you with a great measure of protection
and allow for other deductions and a wider variety of activitiesthan are possible under an LLC. For example, a Sub-S allows you topartner with other business entities in addition to individuals.
If you plan on partnering up with another investor, you need to for-
malize the relationship by forming a partnership, as we discuss inChapter 13. A 
partnership is simply a business entity in which the
members agree to work toward a common goal. You need to have a
written agreement in place that stipulates how the partnershipfunctions, who’s responsible for what, and how assets are to bedivided should the partnership dissolve. The partnership itself,however, provides you with little or no protection. You still need toset up a corporation or an LLC for protecting your personal assetsand those of your partner(s).
Transferring Personal 
Assets via Trusts
As an investor, you’re a business owner, and most responsible
business owners keep their business and personal finances sepa-rate. You can be sued by anyone at any time, and you want to pro-tect your family and personal assets as best as possible. Anexcellent way to accomplish this is to place your personal assetsunder someone else’s name or into a separate entity — a 
trust.
Consider the following options:
/H12012Transfer personal assets to your spouse, one of your children,
another relative, or a designated third-party administratorsuch as an attorney or financial planner.
/H12012Shift your assets into a trust — a legal device you as an indi-
vidual place your assets in for the benefit of others, such as
your family.
Investors often spend a great deal of time and effort buildingwealth only to see the fruits of their efforts chipped away by unjus-tified lawsuits and taxes. By holding your assets in an estate ortrust, you not only protect them against legal claims, but you canalso reap substantial tax benefits. Sophisticated investors oftenuse multiple business entities (including LLCs and other corporatestructures) to manage their assets and protect them from a varietyof risks.

Planning For Dummies by Jordan Simon and Brian Caverly (Wiley).Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 3006_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 30In the following sections, we address the advantages and disadvan-
tages of placing your assets in someone else’s name and assist youin deciding which option is best for you.
Weighing the pros and cons of owning
property in another’s name
Investors and business owners often protect assets by placing
them in the name of a spouse or other relative. Before you makethis move, however, you need to have a firm grasp of the pros andcons to protect the property.
Some investors hold some investments in their own names, and
some in the name of their spouses. This strategy increases thenumber of properties you can finance (by getting around FannieMae and Freddie Mac limits on the number of residential proper-ties/mortgages you can hold) and also enables you to diversifyyour assets and limit liabilities.
A real estate investor, for example, may choose to have her spouse
listed as the sole owner of their home, car, and other big-ticketassets and then take out loans and the title to investment proper-ties in her own name only. If she defaults on a loan, she can losethe investment property, but the family home and car are safe.
So, what’s the catch? Placing assets in someone else’s name can
increase your exposure to several risks:
/H12012You lose some control over those assets. If all your personal
assets are listed in your husband’s name only, for example, a
divorce may leave you at a severe disadvantage.
/H12012You may affect your kids’ future financial aid. If you own
property in the name of your children, the value of that 
property can influence the financial aid calculations shouldyour children decide to attend college and require financialassistance.
/H12012You may encounter tax consequences. Putting assets in the
names of your children may also trigger gift tax requirements
or estate tax issues.
/H12012You’re at the mercy of that person’s legal issues. If the
holder of your assets becomes disabled or runs into his own
liability issues, your assets can get tied up for a long time inthe legal wrangling. Bankruptcy, insolvency, or even death(and the subsequent probate) can turn the best of plans into afinancial fiasco.Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 3106_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 31Placing assets in someone else’s name can be a bit of a hassle, but
it usually doesn’t cost all that much. For example, you can headdown to the bureau of motor vehicles and change the name on thetitle for any vehicles you own for a small fee. Likewise, you can usea quitclaim deed to assign ownership of a property for a smallrecording fee. Before you do, however, consult your attorney oraccountant to find out about all the ramifications of transferringownership of your properties because the laws and proceduresvary from state to state.
Gaining asset and tax protection
with an irrevocable trust
Trusts are the most versatile tool for transferring title of assets
without tax implications or increased risk, but they have some lim-itations. We encourage you to discuss your situation with a quali-fied estate planner who can assist you in weighing the potentialbenefits and drawbacks of different options and then set up thetrust for you.
Trusts come in two flavors — revocable and irrevocable. A 
revoca-
bletrust is one you can change or terminate during your lifetime.
An irrevocable trust is one that you can’t change or dissolve — as
grantor (creator of the trust), you no longer own the assets held in
trust. The trust does. An irrevocable trust benefits you in two
important ways:
/H12012Because you no longer own the assets, they’re protected
against any legal actions taken against you.
/H12012The property and its appreciation are outside of your taxable
estate, allowing you to avoid paying estate taxes on the valueof your holdings.
Both revocable and irrevocable trusts protect assets from probate,but only irrevocable trusts can eliminate estate taxes.
The ultimate way to protect assets is to hold them in an offshore
asset protection trust, but we’re not advising that you do that. Thenext best thing is to have your assets owned by a Sub-S or LLC andthen have the shares of the corporation owned by an irrevocabletrust — this is the fortress of U.S. asset protection. The IRS frownsupon any sort of tax optimization scheme, particularly the offshorevariety, so before employing any such scheme, consult a tax attorney.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 3206_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 32Considering real estate investment
trusts (REITs)
Real estate investment trusts (or REITs for short) give small
investors a way to pool their assets and own investment real estateas a group. REITs offer investors three significant benefits:
/H12012Investors can diversify their real estate holdings by owning
pieces of multiple properties. Instead of purchasing a
$200,000 property, for example, a small investor can own a
$10,000 share in 20 properties, spreading the risk.
/H12012Small investors can afford to buy into higher-end real
estate. REITs allow minor league investors to play a smaller
role in the major leagues, because it costs less to buy in.
/H12012REITs simplify the transfer of ownership to different
investors. Instead of selling the property, you simply transfer
shares.
If you have an LLC with 100 or more investors, consult your attor-
ney for assistance in setting up a REIT, to ensure that it meets allthe requirements, including the following:
/H12012Your REIT must have at least 100 shareholders. Why 100?
That’s just one of the rules.
/H12012You must distribute at least 90 percent of your REIT’s taxable
income. In other words, at least 90 percent of the profits earnedby the assets in the REIT must flow through to shareholders.
/H12012Ninety five percent of your REIT’s income must come from
financial investments (including real estate, securities, andannuities), with 75 percent of that total coming from real estate(net profit from sale of assets, rent/lease payments, and so on).
Staying Away from Promissory
Notes with Recourse Clauses
Promissory note is a fancy term for an IOU. Whenever you borrow
money, the lender almost always requires that you sign a promis-
sory note promising to pay back the money under a set of specificconditions, including the 
term (amount of time you have to pay the
loan in full), interest rate, principal (total amount you borrowed),
and payment amount of each scheduled payment.
Promissory notes usually include a recourse clause stipulating that
the person signing for the loan is pledging individual assets asChapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 3306_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 33additional collateral to secure the loan. If the loan goes bad, the
lender can then come after the borrower’s personal assets torecoup any losses.
In the following sections, we explain nonrecourse loans (the most
desirable option), discuss what you need to do if your contract hasa recourse clause, and point out the risks involved in 
cross-collater-
alized loans — loans that enable the lender to lay claim to prop-
erty other than the property the loan was used to purchase.
Opting for a nonrecourse loan
If you’re trying to borrow money for a potentially lucrative invest-
ment, a recourse loan may be your only option, but in most cases,you want a loan that places only the property you’re financing atrisk — a 
nonrecourse loan .
Nonrecourse means that the property stands on its own. Fail to
make your payments, and all you stand to lose is the property youborrowed the money to buy . . . and your pride. Borrowers typi-cally use nonrecourse loans for financing the purchase of largercommercial-type properties, where the lender understands thatthe real value is in the property and the income it generates. If a$15 million loan on a hotel goes bad, the lender knows he can’tshake enough quarters and nickels out of you to pay it back.Instead, he can get the money out of the property.
In some cases, lenders allow you to buy into a nonrecourse clause
by paying a higher interest rate or agreeing to other terms that aremore favorable to the lender. It never hurts to ask, but on smallerproperties, you can usually count on having to agree to some sortof recourse clause. (See the next section for more on how to nego-tiate this recourse clause.)
Any type of fraud, misrepresentation, or misappropriation of funds
in respect to the loan or the property — such as claiming that thebuilding generates more rental income than it really does — canvoid the nonrecourse clause and give the lender the right to comeafter your personal assets.
Negotiating the recourse clause
Although we suggest you go the nonrecourse route as often as pos-
sible, some contracts require a recourse clause. Fortunately, thisclause is usually negotiable. A lender typically doesn’t remove itentirely, but you may be able to negotiate a recourse clause thatlimits your liability. Ask your loan officer or broker whether anyPart I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 3406_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 34options are available. Following are some areas that may be open
for negotiation:
/H12012Property limitations: You may limit the recourse, for exam-
ple, to other real estate holdings in your LLC, thus protecting
your personal residence and other assets.
/H12012Time limitations: You may be able to place a time limitation
on your liability; for example, if you make payments on time
for five years, your personal liability is released.
/H12012Partial recourse: This provision limits your liability to a cer-
tain percentage of the loan or a certain amount (less than the
full amount). Partial recourse can also limit the lender’s abil-ity to collect only under certain conditions.
Almost every residential loan (for one- to four-family investmentproperty) requires personal recourse. Just make sure you under-stand the limitations and options. When signing a promissory note,make sure that the recourse clause is limited to the assets you’rewilling to put at risk.
Avoiding cross-collateralization
To protect their money, lenders like to know that you have plenty
of collateral — anything of value that they can take from you and
sell to get their money back in the event you’re unable or unwilling
to pay back the loan. When the housing market is thriving andproperty values are on the rise, lenders tend to accept the prop-erty you’re financing as collateral on the loan. If you don’t makeyour payments, they can foreclose, sell the property, and get backall or nearly all their money.Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 35
Your recourse to recourse loans
I (Chip) once had 16 doctors who went in together on a commercial building as an
investment. The bank wanted a full recourse loan on each of them, which wouldhave given them a total of 1600 percent coverage on the loan. We negotiated for a10 percent personal recourse on each investor, which still provided the lender with160 percent coverage. We were also able to eliminate personal liability after fiveyears of satisfactory payments.
The moral of this story is this: Don’t accept what the lender offers as a final offer. As
long as you’re a serious investor with a solid plan in place, you can usually negoti-ate more attractive terms with the lender.06_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 35On riskier investments — when property values are declining or
the property’s value is close to the amount being borrowed or alarge loan is being taken out to purchase multiple properties — the lender may want to 
cross-collateralize the loan. With cross-
collateralization, two or more properties act as collateral for a
single loan. If you fail to make payments on the loan, the lender can foreclose on other properties to collect the amount due.
For the investor, cross-collateralization exposes other properties to
the liabilities of one. Stay away from these types of loans if at allpossible. You can’t always avoid cross-collateralization, but weencourage you to at least try. Otherwise, you may lose a goodincome property just because one of your other properties is a dog.
Steering Clear of Real Estate 
and Mortgage Fraud
Wherever you find money, you find crooks — con artists deter-
mined to score some quick cash. As a real estate investor, you’revulnerable to real estate and mortgage fraud in any or all of the fol-lowing three ways: as a target, as a perpetrator, or as an unwittingaccomplice. And all these roles can ultimately undermine yourlong-term success, not to mention your reputation.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 36
Cross-collateralization nightmare
Several years ago, I (Chip) had a friend who had a great idea for a retail clothing
store. Couldn’t lose, or so he thought. Unfortunately, his overconfidence led him tobe careless in borrowing money for his new venture. He allowed the loan hesecured to buy the building to be cross-collateralized with the store’s inventory andmany of his personal assets.
A sharp downturn in the market transformed his dreams to dust in a mere 18 months,
but the worst was yet to come: The lender not only foreclosed on the building andtook his inventory but also went after his home, car, boat, and retirement fund. Thefinancial strain eventually ended his marriage.
Any investment that’s worth pursuing usually involves some risk, but going all in
when you don’t really have to is folly. By avoiding the cross-collateralization trap,you limit your risk to the new investment.
No investment is a sure thing. Protect yourself from unforeseen and unfortunate
circumstances as much as possible.06_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 36In the following sections, we describe the main types of real estate
and mortgage fraud, to empower you to steer clear of scams andschemes that can get you into trouble.
Ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it. Unfortunately,
ignorance is as rampant as fraud in the real estate industry. Manyreal estate professionals may try to convince you that somethingillegal is okay because everybody does it or because these are “vic-timless crimes.” However, as we’ve seen from the mortgage melt-down beginning in 2008, homeowners and investors ultimately paythe price.

the American Dream of Homeownership by Ralph R. Roberts and
Rachel Dollar (Kaplan Publishing).
Telling the truth on your application
A huge percentage of real estate and mortgage fraud could be elim-
inated if everyone in the industry, including investors, would worktogether to ensure that all the information on loan applications iscomplete and accurate.
Buyers and those who assist them often think that accuracy is
optional, but the loan application, the 1003 (commonly referred toas a ten-oh-three, or officially as the Uniform Residential LoanApplication), clearly states, just above the space for your signa-ture, the following:Chapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 37
Refusing to play a role in fraud for housing
Fraud for housing used to be the most common type of real estate and mortgage
fraud and the most “harmless” (although still illegal). It consists of lying on a loanapplication so you can purchase a home to live in – as opposed to “fraud for profit,”in which you’re committing fraud to obtain money.
When you’re acting as an investor, you’re at a pretty low risk of becoming a perpe-
trator of fraud for housing because you’re not buying the property to live in it.However, you may be at risk for becoming an accomplice if you’re trying to sell aproperty to buyers who are having trouble qualifying for a mortgage loan.
If prospective buyers are having trouble qualifying for a loan to buy the property
you’re selling, they may just not be able to afford the payments. Don’t try to “help”them by encouraging them to lie on their loan application or by referring them to aloan officer who’s known for bending the rules.06_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 37I/We fully understand that it is a federal crime punishable by fine
or imprisonment, or both, to knowingly make any false state-ments concerning any of the above facts as applicable under theprovisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, et seq.
What constitutes a 
false statement? Here’s a list of what may be
considered false:
/H12012Stating or providing false records that you’re employed some-
where you’re not.
/H12012Stating or providing false records of income.
/H12012Providing false identification.
/H12012Boosting your credit score by piggybacking on someone else’s
better credit.
/H12012Falsifying ownership of assets, either by stating that you own
items you don’t or by renting assets. (Some disreputable com-panies allow you to rent assets, so you appear to own moreassets than you really do.)
/H12012Failing to disclose a silent second. A silent second is a separate
mortgage typically taken out to cover the down payment. As
we discuss in Chapter 14, taking out a second mortgage tofinance the down payment is okay, but not disclosing it is ille-gal. It creates the false impression that you’re more financiallysecure than you really are.
Dodging predatory lenders
Although lenders are often the victims of mortgage fraud, they may
also be guilty of committing fraud and are even more frequentlyguilty of lending practices that prey on uninformed borrowers.Whenever you’re applying for a loan, keep one hand on your walletand one eye out for the following questionable and perhaps illegallending practices:
/H12012Charging you higher-than-normal loan origination fees (includ-
ing points).
/H12012Encouraging you to bend the truth on a loan application, so
you can qualify for a loan you would otherwise not qualify for.
/H12012Having you sign a blank loan application and then filling in the
details for you later.
/H12012Refinancing your mortgage repeatedly within a short period of
time.
/H12012Selling you a high-cost, high-interest loan when you would
qualify for a low-cost, low-interest loan.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 3806_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 38/H12012Adding products or services such as credit life insurance to a
loan without adequately informing you about the need or costof these products or services. Watch out for hidden (undis-closed) fees.
/H12012Selling you products or services that are nonexistent or offer
no benefit.
/H12012Convincing you to borrow more than you can reasonably
afford to pay back.
/H12012Pressuring you to accept high-risk loans, such as balloon-
payment loans, interest-only mortgages, subprime oradjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), and loans with high prepayment penalties.
/H12012Selling high-interest loans based on ethnicity or nationality
rather than your credit history and financial situation.
Always obtain three or more quotes from different companiesbefore choosing a loan and compare the quotes carefully (seeChapter 6 for details). Doing so enables you to see any hidden loancosts more clearly. When applying for and closing on a loan, readthe documents carefully to make sure the information is accurateand complete.
Saying “no” to inflated appraisals
One of the main instruments that real estate con artists use to ply
their trade is the inflated appraisal — a document showing that a
property is worth significantly more than its true market value. By
obtaining an inflated appraisal (forging one or paying off a crookedappraiser), the con artist can create equity in a property wherenone exists.
As an investor, never try to sway the opinion of an appraiser or
allow a loan officer, real estate agent, or anyone else to convinceyou to go along with a deal that involves an inflated appraisal.
Also, be careful about overpaying for a property whose value has
been artificially boosted by inflated appraisals. You can protectyourself by ordering your own independent appraisal before pur-chasing a property. Find an appraiser in the area who has a solidgold reputation and plenty of experience in the market you’rebuying into. Don’t let the seller or seller’s agent recommend anappraiser. You pay a few hundred dollars for your own appraisal,but it can save you from making a mistake costing tens or evenhundreds of thousands of dollars.
We also recommend against using online appraisals or computer-
ized valuation models. You want a real live person, a qualifiedChapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 3906_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 39appraiser who knows the local market, to physically inspect the
property and provide you with an educated estimate of its marketvalue. There’s really no substitute.
Turning your back on cash-
back-at-closing schemes
One of the most prevalent forms of fraud, particularly when the
market is down, consists of providing the buyer with cash back at
closing . The buyer agrees to pay more for the property than it’s
worth and obtains an inflated appraisal showing that the property
is actually worth the purchase price. The seller agrees to raise theasking price and kick back the excess money to the buyer at clos-ing. Many people think these arrangements are okay, but don’t befooled — cash back at closing is illegal. Protect yourself:
/H12012Don’t offer buyers cash back at closing or any other “perks”
that the lender is actually financing, including “free” furniture,a cruise, upgrades, and so on.
/H12012Don’t accept cash back at closing, even if it comes in some
other form, such as “free” furniture, upgrades, rebates,refunds, or anything else that’s actually being paid out of theloan amount.
Avoiding illegal flipping
Flipping houses, as described in Flipping Houses For Dummies , is
perfectly legal. You buy a house below market value, fix it up, and
then sell it for a profit. However, another type of flipping is clearlyillegal. It consists of buying a property, typically a dilapidatedhouse, at well below market value, doing a few cosmetic repairs tomake it look nice, and then selling it for much more than its truemarket value.
As an investor, avoid illegal flipping. In addition to breaking the
law, this type of flipping ruins your long-term success. Illegal flip-pers may score some quick cash, but they quickly ruin their repu-tations and often end up in legal trouble. It’s not worth it.
To avoid becoming the victim of an illegal flip, always check the
recent sales prices of similar homes in the same neighborhood tomake sure the asking price of the property you’re about to pur-chase is realistic. Make sure you’re the one choosing the homeinspector and the appraiser. If the seller offers to handle this foryou, politely decline the offer.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 4006_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 40Defending yourself against 
chunking schemes
Real estate investors often become the targets of con artists
through what is commonly referred to as a chunking scheme . The
con artist dangles a quick-cash, no-hassle investment opportunity
in front of the eager investor and offers to take care of all thedetails. The investor only has to put up the cash or sign the papersfor the loan that to finance the deal.
The organizer promises to place renters, collect the rent, make the
mortgage payments, and so on, and tells the investor that the rentalpayments will cover the mortgage and maybe even earn a littleextra cash each month. The investor can sell the property at anytime and profit from it because the property is sure to appreciate.
The truth behind the deal is that the properties are usually over-
valued, the renters don’t exist, and the con artist never intends tomake the mortgage payments. Investors are left with dilapidatedhomes, unpaid mortgages, and destroyed credit.
The best way to avoid getting sucked in by a chunking scheme is to
plug your ears when you hear someone pitching a no-risk, no-hassle way to earning riches in real estate. Quite frankly, suchdeals don’t exist. Do your homework. Visit the property andinspect it with your own two eyes. Oversee the management of theproperty. Don’t let someone else “handle all the details” becausethey probably intend to handle you out of your money.
Refusing a builder bailout
Builders who become overextended may try to dig themselves out
of a financial hole by selling homes (or whatever they’re building)before completion to unsuspecting buyers. In some cases, thebuilder eventually completes the project. In other cases, he maytake the cash and leave the buyer with an unfinished building oreven a vacant lot.
When banks finance new construction (see Chapter 9), they don’t
give the builder all the money at once. They set up an account thatthe builder draws from during the building process. The bankwants to make sure the project is completed, so it ties the cashdraws to success and to certain milestones. When those mile-stones are completed, the bank can then free up the money to payfor the supplies and services. For example, if the rough lumberneeded for a project costs $28,000, the bank would give the builderChapter 2: Shielding Your Personal Assets from Investment Risks 4106_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 41a draw for $28,000, which would then flow to the lumber company
after the framing was complete. The lumber company would then
sign a waiver of lien, acknowledging payment and freeing up its
claim to the property.
When a builder becomes strapped for cash, he may try to get the
money sooner by employing any of the following strategies:
/H12012Falsifying inspection reports
/H12012Submitting fake certifications of work performed
/H12012Fooling the inspectors by removing items from some buildings
and installing them in others to make it appear as thoughprogress is being made
/H12012Selling an incomplete property to the buyer
The best way to avoid builder bailout scams is to choose a rep-
utable builder and refuse to close on the deal until you have thebuilding thoroughly inspected by a professional inspector of yourchoosing.
Acting with integrity: 
The golden rule
Far too many investors succumb to the temptation to commit
fraud because they’re in a hurry to make a quick buck. All these“investors” eventually fail because they tarnish their own reputa-tions and damage the very industry that puts money in their pockets.
The best way to achieve long-term success as a real estate investor
is to make a commitment to follow the golden rule — treat othersas you would want to be treated. You can still earn a handsomeprofit in real estate by purchasing properties legitimately and set-ting a fair price when you sell. You don’t have to break or bend thelaws to be successful. You just need to do your homework.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 4206_422335-ch02.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 42Chapter 3

Lenders aren’t exactly tripping over themselves to lend money,
especially in the recent credit debacles of the mid-2000s. They
want to know who they’re lending it to, for what, and how andwhen they’re going to get paid back. They usually operate conserv-atively, weighing the risks before quoting you a price. If they seeyour venture as too risky, they may reject your loan applicationoutright. If they believe you’re in a strong position to pay back theloan in full, they may offer you financing at lower interest rates towin your business. If they see you as a moderate risk, you mayreceive financing at higher rates.
In any event, the lender wants to see how you look on paper — the
value of what you own, how much you owe, how much you earn,your credit history, and so on. Before you even think about applyingfor a loan, gather all the documents and information that lenders arelikely to request. This chapter leads you through the process.
Examining Your Credit Reports
Good credit is gold. Without it, you have access to your money
only. With it, you can put other people’s money to work for you.Whenever you apply for a loan, the lending institution performs a
credit check — a background check to make sure that you’re not up07_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 43to your gills in debt, that your income covers expenses, and that
you pay your bills on time. They examine your credit history (doc-umented by the three major credit reporting agencies), bank state-ments, pay stubs, W-2s, tax forms, and other financial records.
To ensure success at obtaining loans, become proactive in ensuring
your credit history remains unblemished. Check your credit reportevery three months or so, correct any errors, and take steps toimprove your credit rating, as instructed in the following sections.No irregularity is too small to correct. (Checking your own creditreport doesn’t negatively affect your credit score as can too many
credit inquiries from prospective creditors. Check your credit history
regularly, but keep loan and credit card applications to a minimum.)
The following sections show you how to obtain, review, and cor-
rect your credit report. We also offer suggestions on how toimprove your credit score.
Obtaining free copies of your reports
As of September 1, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) man-
dated each of the three major credit reporting companies provideyou with a free credit report once every 12 months (a total of threefree credit reports per year). These three major national creditreporting bureaus contain slightly different information about yourcredit history, or what’s called a 
credit report orcredit profile.
To obtain your free credit report, do one of the following:
/H12012Submit your request online at
www.annualcreditreport.com .
/H12012Phone in your request by calling toll-free 877-322-8228.

To give your credit rating an air of objectivity, credit reporting
agencies often assign you a credit score that ranges roughly
between 300 (you never paid a bill in your life) and 900 (you
borrow often, always pay your bills on time, and don’t carry anyhuge balances on your credit cards). A “good” credit score is 700or above. A “great” credit score is anything higher than 780.
Your credit score determines not only whether you qualify for a loan
but also how much you’re qualified to borrow and at what interestrate. A high credit score enables you to borrow more and pay lessinterest on it. A high score can also lower your home and auto insur-ance rates so keeping a close eye on your score is important.Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 45
Credit score stats
Credit reporting agencies rely on one or more statistical models to determine your
credit score. One of the most popular models is the Fair Isaac Company (FICO) ratingsystem. The credit company assigns numerical values to particular pieces of datain your credit history, such as the length of your credit history and the various typesof interest you’re paying. They then plug these numbers into the statistical model,which spits out your credit score. It’s basically a numbers game that weighs thedata on your credit report in the following manner:
/H1201235 percent of the score is based on payment history
/H1201230 percent is based on outstanding debt or how much you currently owe
/H1201215 percent is based on the length of your credit history or how long you’ve been
borrowing
/H1201210 percent is based on recent inquiries on your report (whenever a lending insti-
tution requests a report)
/H1201210 percent is based on the types of credit, such as mortgage or credit card interest07_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 45Although the law requires each credit agency to supply you with
one report annually, it doesn’t require them to provide your creditscore. When you’re getting your free report, you can choose to payextra to include your credit score.
Inspecting your report for problems
When you receive your credit report, inspect it carefully for the 
following red flags:
/H12012Names that are the same as or similar to yours, but aren’t you.
/H12012Relative with the same name; for example, a father (Senior) if
you’re Junior.
/H12012Addresses of places you’ve never lived.
/H12012Aliases you’ve never used, which may indicate that someone
else is using your Social Security Number or the credit report-ing agency has mixed someone else’s data into yours.
/H12012Multiple Social Security Numbers, flagging the possibility that
information for someone with the same name has made it intoyour credit report.
/H12012Wrong date of birth (DOB).
/H12012Credit cards you don’t have.
/H12012Loans you haven’t taken out.
/H12012Records of unpaid bills that you either know you paid or have
good reason for not paying.
/H12012Records of delinquent payments that weren’t delinquent or
you have a good excuse for not paying on time.
/H12012Inquiries from companies with whom you’ve never done busi-
ness. (When you apply for a loan, the lender typically runs an
inquiry on your credit report, and that shows up on the report.)
An address of a place you’ve never lived or records of accounts,
loans, and credit cards you never had may be a sign that some-body has stolen your identity. Yikes! Contact the credit reportingcompany immediately and request that a fraud alert be placed onyour credit report.

Preventing Identity Theft For
Dummies by Michael J. Arata, Jr. (Wiley).Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 4607_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 46Repairing your credit and 
boosting your score
If you have a credit score of 700 or higher, pat yourself on the back.
You’re above average and certainly qualified to borrow big bucksat the lowest available rates. Anything below about 680 sounds thewarning sirens that you need to dispute errors on your report orrepair your credit as quickly as possible. This number is the pointat which lending institutions get out their magnifying glasses andbegin raising rates and denying credit.
If your credit rating dips below 700, take steps to improve it, such
as the following:
/H12012Dispute any erroneous items on your credit report.
Disputing a claim doesn’t always result in a correction, but
you can add a paragraph to your report explaining your sideof the story.
/H12012Apply for fewer loans and credit cards. When you apply for a
loan or credit card, the lending institution typically orders an
inquiry that shows up on your credit report. Evidence thatyou’re applying for several loans or credit cards in a shortperiod of time can make you appear financially desperate.
/H12012Pay off your credit card balances, if possible, or at least
enough so the balance is 50 percent or below your availablecredit limit. 
Doing so shows that your credit isn’t maxed out.
Paying off high-interest credit card balances is always a good idea,
but don’t start consolidating loans and closing out accounts. Havingfour open accounts with a balance of $1,000 each on a $5,000 creditlimit looks better than one account with a credit limit of $5,000 and a$4,000 balance. Why? Because of something called 
credit utilization —
your total debt relative to the amount of credit available to you.
Keeping your credit utilization below 80 percent (preferably below60 percent) improves your score.

provide seasoned credit within 90 days. Law enforcement authori-ties are shutting down these sites on a regular basis.

Credit Repair Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by
Steve Bucci (Wiley).Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 4707_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 47Avoiding mistakes that can 
sabotage your loan approval
After you apply for a loan, resist the urge to make any life-changing
decisions that negatively affect your current financial status. Majorchanges can undermine your efforts to secure a loan, so followthese sage do’s and don’ts:
/H12012Do stay married: Divorce drains your emotions, energy, and
finances. It cuts your assets in half and increases your liabili-
ties, obliterating your chances of securing a loan.
/H12012Don’t apply for other loans or credit cards: Any last-minute
inquiries that pop up on your credit report can be a red flag
that cautions prospective lenders.
/H12012Do avoid buying big-ticket items: Buying an expensive vehi-
cle can sink a deal. If you must have the vehicle, buy, fix, and
sell the investment property first, and then purchase the vehi-cle with your profit.
/H12012Don’t make any major purchases on credit: This advice goes
for a car, furniture, health club membership, big-screen TV,
and any other purchase that can throw off your debt-to-income ratio (see “Calculating your debt ratio” later in thischapter).
/H12012Don’t cosign for any loans: No matter what your relationship
with the borrower is (or how badly your son, daughter, or
long-lost uncle needs the money), don’t cosign a loan. Doingso exposes your credit history to potential blemishes whenothers fail to make their payments.
/H12012Don’t withdraw or move substantial amounts of cash: If a
prospective lender looks at an account expecting to see $10,000,
and it shows a $50 balance, you have some explaining to do.
/H12012Do pay your bills on time: Records of unpaid bills and delin-
quent payments can get back to prospective lenders. If you
have a stack of unpaid bills, pay them now. If a bill is due onthe 1st and you pay it on the 15th, you can avoid the late fee.Paying it before the 30th typically keeps the late payment offyour credit report. But any bill payment after the due date isconsidered late and qualifies as 
slow pay, which lenders can
figure into their formula assuming they know about it.
If your financial situation changes between the application and the
time of closing, you’re legally obligated to inform the loan officerand lender of the change.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 4807_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 48Chasing Down Vital Paperwork
You can approach a loan application in one of two ways: Either
show up with all the paperwork, facts, and figures in hand or con-sult with a lender first and find out what she needs. The firstapproach is best, because it demonstrates to lenders that you’rewell organized and are committed to providing them with every-thing they need to do their job.
However, in order to come prepared to your lender, you must know
which paperwork you need for the meeting. In the following sec-tions, we reveal the information and documentation most lendersare going to require to process your loan application.
Delving into your personal 
financial information
Unless you plan to borrow money solely against business assets,
lenders are going to want to know everything about your personalfinances — the value of everything you own, the total you alreadyowe on other loans and credit cards, your monthly and annualincome, monthly bills, and so on. And they’ll want documentationto back up all those figures.
The following sections show you how to calculate some of these
important figures, including your net worth and debt ratio, and listthe documentation required to prove the amount of cash you haveand the monthly and annual income you earn.
Calculating your net worth
Most people in real estate and banking know their own net worth.
Asking folks in these circles, “What’s your net worth?” is about asnatural as asking them their name. When we ask most consumersto estimate their net worth, however, they look puzzled, as if wehad asked them for the square root of pi. They simply have betterthings to entertain themselves.
Net worth is simply whatever money you would have if you sold all
your stuff and then paid off all your debts, including your taxes.
Officially, the equation goes like this:
Net Worth = Assets – Liabilities
A strong positive net worth indicates that youChapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 4907_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 49/H12012Own more than you owe
/H12012Don’t borrow more than you can afford to pay back
/H12012Can pay off a loan by liquidating assets, if needed
/H12012Pay your taxes on time
/H12012Probably know more about net worth than you realize
To prove to a lender that you’re net worthy, follow these simple
steps to calculate your net worth:
1. Jot down a list of your assets and liabilities.
The tough part is identifying assets and liabilities.
Following these steps are lists of common assets and liabili-ties, which can help you identify yours.
2. Total your assets.
3. Subtract your liabilities.
The next time someone asks, “What’s your net worth?”
you’re prepared to answer.
The following lists of items may stimulate your brain cells and helpyou identify different examples of assets and liabilities.
/H12012Home: If you sold your home today, what could you get for it?
If you recently had an appraisal, use that number, assuming
the appraiser assigned it an honest value.
/H12012Other real estate: If you have a vacation home or other real
estate, consider how much you could get for it if you sold it
today.
/H12012Car: The blue book value (current value), not what you paid
for it.
/H12012Savings account: Whether you have $5 or $50,000, it counts.
/H12012Checking account: The current balance as recorded in your
check register. No cheating. If you just wrote five checks that
haven’t cleared yet, you don’t really have that money.
/H12012Retirement savings: 401(k), IRA, SEP, or other account that
you don’t dip into for your daily living expenses.
/H12012Investments: Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that aren’t part
of a retirement account.
/H12012Jewelry, antiques, and artwork: If you’re not sure what this
stuff is worth, have it professionally appraised. People often
think that their stuff is worth much more than it really is.
/H12012Furniture: If you sold all your furniture at an auction or
garage sale, what could you get for it?Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 5007_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 50/H12012Cash value of life insurance: If you have term life insurance,
it’s worth $0. If you use a life insurance policy as an 
investment, how much is it worth today?
If you don’t have it, don’t count it. The money you stand to inheritwhen Aunt Millie kicks the bucket doesn’t count.
Now for the painful part — liabilities. These are items such as the
following:
/H12012Mortgage principal: The amount you owe on your house
today and on any other loans you’ve taken out on the house.
/H12012Car loan: How much would paying off your car loan today
cost? Write it down.
/H12012Student loans: If you’re paying off any student loans from
your old college days or are named as a cosigner on any of
your kids’ student loans, record the amounts as liabilities.
/H12012Credit card debt: Dig out your credit card bills and tally up
the total you currently owe on them.
/H12012Taxes owed: Do you owe any back taxes or property taxes?
Total the amount.
/H12012Personal loans: Did you borrow $5 from the neighbor to buy
candy from the neighborhood kids? Write it down.
You may be able to obtain most of the liability information you
need from your credit report, as discussed earlier in this chapterin the section “Examining Your Credit Reports.” However, if youknow that you have a debt that doesn’t appear on the creditreport, be sure to include it in your calculations.
Calculating your debt ratio
Almost every lender examines your debt ratio, so you should know
what it is before the topic ever comes up. Your debt ratio is how
much you pay out in monthly bills compared to your gross
monthly income. Generally speaking, you can estimate your debtratio by dividing your total monthly payments (on loans and creditcards) by your total monthly income:
Debt Ratio = Total Monthly Payments ÷ Total Monthly Income
Your total monthly payments apply only to payments on loans andcredit card balances, not for other expenses like groceries, gas, orclothing. They include payments on long-term debts, such as a carloan or student loan payments, alimony, child support, or a bal-ance you carry on one or more credit cards. Debt ratios come intwo flavors:Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 5107_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 51/H12012Back-end debt ratio: The back-end ratio consists of your total
debt payments (including your house payment with home-
owner’s insurance and property taxes) divided by yourmonthly income. According to the Federal Housing Authority(FHA), your back-end debt ratio should not exceed 43 percent.
/H12012Front-end debt ratio: The front-end debt ratio (also called the
housing ratio ) consists of your house payment alone (includ-
ing property taxes and insurance) divided by your total
monthly income. According to the FHA, your front-end debtratio should not exceed 31 percent. If your total gross house-hold income is $6,000 per month, for example, your housepayment alone should not exceed $1,860.
Gathering bank statements
Almost all lenders are going to ask for copies of the most recent
two months’ bank statements, so they can see how much cash youhave in savings and checking, determine whether you have ahealthy cash flow, and check for any activity that looks out of theordinary (such as large deposits or withdrawals that can’t beexplained by other documentation). Make a copy of your two mostrecent bank statements — whether you receive statementsmonthly or quarterly.
On the copies, take a black magic marker and mark out the
account numbers to prevent others from gaining unauthorizedaccess to your accounts.
Tracking down your pay stubs and W-2s
If you work a regular job, you probably get a paycheck every week
or two that shows your gross pay, your deductions (state and fed-eral income tax, Social Security, and so on), and what’s left — your
net pay. Most lenders want a full month (30 days’ worth) of consec-
utive paycheck stubs — not one from last week and another from
two months ago; they need to be the most recent and consecutive.They should also show your year-to-date (YTD) earnings.
Most lenders also want to see proof of previous years’ income. Of
course, they can obtain this evidence by looking at your previoustwo years of federal income tax returns, but many lenders also liketo see your W-2 forms, so be sure to make copies of these as well.
If you don’t have a regular job, skip ahead to the section
“Accounting for business income” to find out which records youneed to supply to prove your business income.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 5207_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 52Gathering tax returns and schedules
Every lender requires you to submit along with your loan applica-
tion your federal income tax returns. Make sure you provide copiesof your two most recent federal income tax returns. Copy the com-plete federal tax return, including all schedules and attachments,not just the first two pages of the return. Include 
everything — don’t
leave something out just because you don’t think it’s relevant.
You don’t need to supply your state income tax returns unless state
grants or subsidies are involved in the transaction or financing.
Pulling up other useful documents
If you follow the instructions in the previous sections, you now
have all the major facts, figures, and documentation you needrelated to your personal finances. However, additional documenta-tion may also be useful (and necessary) in determining whetheryou qualify for a particular loan. Your lender or broker may needthe following:
/H12012Any documents that support your income, such as employ-
ment contracts with step increases; union benefit agreements;notes receivable; real estate earnings; earnings from trusts,estates, or settlements; or documentation showing major lot-tery winnings.
/H12012Property income, including GAI (Gross Annual Income) from
rents; storage fees; fees for facilities, such as clubhouse,pools, satellite TV, cable, laundry, or Internet; parking or car-port fees; pet income; income from signage; a percentage oftenant sales (for retail commercial properties); and so on.
/H12012Documentation of any unusual liabilities (or the exclusion of
them), such as major reimbursed business expenses, person-ally guaranteed business loans (appearing on your creditreport), or old loans that you’ve paid off but that haven’tcleared from your report.
Create copies of any documentation that supports your claims ofassets, liabilities, and income. Prospective lenders may requestspecific documents, but gathering everything you have available inadvance makes your job that much easier later on.
Accounting for business income
If you don’t have a regular job or you have income (or losses) from
a business, you need to supply proof of your income or loss:Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 5307_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 53/H12012Some of this documentation may already be included in your
federal income tax returns. Be sure to include allschedules
(C’s E’s, K-1’s, and so on) so that the lender has an accurate
picture of each of your investments and business holdings.
/H12012If you own 25 percent or more of any company, corporation,
or LLC, provide copies of each entity’s federal returns for thepast two years.
/H12012To provide more recent data, produce a report showing YTD
income and expenses for the business. You can produce suchreports fairly easily by using a business or personal financeprogram, such as Quicken or QuickBooks. If you have anaccountant, ask the accountant to produce a report for you.
Documenting the property 
you plan to purchase
Your gut feeling that a particular property is a great investment
may be enough to convince you to sign a purchase agreement, butit’s rarely enough to convince lenders to finance the purchase. Youneed to have a plan in place for how you’re going to profit from theinvestment, complete with fairly realistic estimates concerning thecosts and revenue potential.
Many novice investors view the loan application process as a big
hassle that just gets in the way of their vision and profits. However,by forcing you to think ahead, the process actually protects youfrom making bad investment decisions. As an investor, you shouldonly purchase a property to make money or create future wealth,and you should be able to show how an investment will furtherthose goals before you ever sign a purchase agreement.
In the following sections, we show you how to estimate and 
document the profit potential for investment properties.
Obtaining an appraisal or comparative market analysis
As a real estate investor, your goal is to discover properties that are
likely to generate profits. Basically you don’t want to pay more forthe property than it’s worth. To help in your calculations, get yourhands on a 
comparative market analysis or appraisal. Your real
estate agent can provide you with a comparative market analysis
that shows the probable value of the property in relation to similarproperties that have sold recently or are currently on the market.
You want to keep your eyes open for property that’s likely to make
you profits in one or both of the following two ways:Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 5407_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 54/H12012Income from sale: You’re looking to buy low and sell high or
legally “flip” the property. For more about flipping properties,
check out Flipping Houses For Dummies.
/H12012Rental income: You’re planning a buy-and-hold strategy, in
which your rental income covers (or more than covers) your
expenses until you decide to sell the property (hopefully formore than you paid for it).
If you want something more formal and more detailed, you mayconsider hiring an appraiser. A qualified appraiser can evaluate themarket value of the property (to assist in estimating your potentialincome from selling it) or evaluate the income of the property byusing a Net Operating Income (NOI) formula (see Chapter 8).
When you’re just checking out some properties, bringing in an
appraiser may be premature (and an unnecessary expense). Mostinvestors rely on their own market knowledge and perhaps theiragents’ insight to estimate the property’s value. The appraiserenters the picture just prior to closing to confirm that the propertyis worth the price you’re paying. However, if you’re seriously consid-ering a property and are questioning your instincts, you may want tohire an appraiser for a second opinion before moving forward.
The seller whose property you’re thinking of buying may already
have had an appraisal done, in which case, you may be able toreview it just by asking. (Don’t place blind faith in the seller’sappraisal — use it only to confirm or question your own evaluation.) 
Looking ahead to potential resale value and repair costs
When you obtain an appraisal, the appraiser usually takes into
account the property’s current condition. If you plan to flip theproperty for a quick profit, estimate the market value of the prop-erty after repairs. What’s a realistic price you think you can get forthe property after fixing it up? Your real estate agent should beable to help you come up with a realistic value.
You also need to estimate your total costs for the project, includ-
ing the cost of repairs and renovations, holding costs for the dura-tion of the project (the total you plan to spend on loan interest,property taxes, loan interest, and utilities), and the cost of sellingthe property (any real estate agent commissions and closing fees).
Overestimate costs and underestimate the final sale price, so you
have a bit of a buffer. For details about making well-calculatedinvestments when flipping properties, check out 
Flipping Houses
For Dummies by none other than Ralph and Joe, two of your
esteemed authors (Wiley).Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 5507_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 55If you’re planning on holding the property for several years rather
than doing a quick flip, you still need to consider the potentialfuture value of the property. For example, if you’re buying into aneighborhood where home values are on the rise, then paying closeto the appraised value of the property may make sense. The ques-tion you need to answer is this: How likely is it that I will more thanrecoup my investment when I finally decide to sell the property?
Performing a quick cash flow analysis
One of the best ways to build wealth in real estate is to purchase
property and hold it indefinitely. During the time you hold the prop-erty, you profit in three ways:
/H12012The property appreciates, gaining in value.
/H12012Renters pay down your principal (the amount you owe on the
property).
/H12012You get a tax write-off for any expenses you incur relating to
the rental property.
Of course, your profit hinges on the assumption that you earnmore in rent than the property costs you in expenses (includingtaxes, insurance, landlord-paid utilities, repairs, and improve-ments). In short, you (and your lenders) want to make sure thatthat your investment delivers a positive cash flow so you’re notlosing money.
The formulas for calculating cash flow (or NOI) are fairly basic:
GAI – VAC = EGI
EGI – TOE = NOI
If those formulas look like Greek to you, read on:
/H12012GAI is your Gross Annual Income; simply calculate your
yearly income from all possible sources (rent, carport, laun-
dry, storage, parking, and so on).
/H12012VAC is a vacancy allowance; use a minimum of 5 percent of
the GAI to allow for vacancy (periods when you have no
renters).
/H12012EGI is your Effective Gross Income — the total workable rev-
enue you see from the property. Another way of looking at it is
that this is the amount of money you have on hand to coveryour property’s expenses.
/H12012TOE represents your Total Operating Expenses; this figure
includes all the costs to operate the property, except the loan
payments. It includes maintenance, taxes, insurance, Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 5607_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 56management, landscaping, landlord-paid utilities, office
expenses, and so on.
/H12012NOI is your Net Operating Income; this number represents
your profit on a yearly basis, assuming you pay cash for the
property.
This formula works for allbuy-and-hold properties. It shows you
and your lenders how much you can afford to pay monthly for the
financing. We look at calculating those numbers in Chapter 8.
Calculating the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio
The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a mathematic representation of how
much you owe on your home compared to its appraised value.
Banks use L TVs to justify lending money to high-risk borrowers.Even if you have a low credit score and a history of paying yourbills a little late, a bank may be willing to cut you some slack andapprove your loan if your L TV ratio is low. In other words, the moreequity you have in your home, the more likely the bank willapprove your loan.
For example, if your home appraises for $250,000 and you owe
$200,000 on it, the L TV is $200,000 ÷ $250,000, or 80 percent.Anything below 80 percent is considered great and often qualifiesyou to borrow more money at a lower interest rate.
Be realistic and know how much you can really afford to borrow.
Don’t cause yourself stress and future problems by trying to stretchyour finances too thin. If after you do your calculations it looks asthough you can’t afford to borrow more money, don’t. Check outsome of your other options instead, as we explain in Part IV .
Obtaining zoning information
Most counties or cities zone properties for specific uses, usually to
keep businesses out of residential districts or vice versa. Beforeyou purchase a property, find out how it’s zoned so you knowabout anything that could restrict the way you use the property.Check with the local city or county assessment or building inspection office regarding the following:
/H12012How the property is currently zoned
/H12012Any plans to change the zoning for this area
/H12012Whether your intended use of the property fits the current
and any new zoning restrictions
/H12012Whether the property is subject to changes in zoning require-
ments; some properties have “grandfather” clauses that allowChapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 5707_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 57them to operate without being subject to changes in the zoning
requirements, but these clauses may expire when ownership ofa property changes
Pulling city and county records
When you’re investing in real estate, knowledge is power; the more
you know about a property before you buy it, the less likely youare to encounter nasty surprises later. The info you gather mayalso improve your chances of obtaining financing to purchase andrestore the property. One way to obtain additional information isto research the public records.
Call the city or county assessor’s office or the County Real Estate
Mapping Division (every county has one) and find out how toaccess the parcel maps, aerial maps, tax records, building records,zoning or building appeals, violations, and ownership records. Thecounty has to make all these documents available to the public.Many cities and townships post their records and even propertyhistories online.
If you notice any red flags in the property records, such as a build-
ing code violation, address them before you purchase the propertyand they become 
your headache. In many cases, liabilities for viola-
tions and/or discrepancies (such as boundary lines, easements,
riparian rights [relating to a body of water], natural resource claims,
and so on) reach back to only a certain number of previous owners.
You don’t want to get stuck on the hook for someone else’s problemfrom long ago.Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 58
Zoning fiasco
If you think that zoning restrictions are something you can deal with later, think
again — they may just deal with you later. Several years ago, I (Chip) bought aproperty without thinking too much about zoning restrictions and grandfatherclauses. I planned to use the property pretty much the same way the owner beforeme used it. Because no grandfather clause was in place that would expire whenI took ownership, I figured I was safe.
Unfortunately, a different type of grandfather clause was in place — one I hadn’t con-
sidered. The clause stated that if the property burned down, 
nothing could be built in
its place. The lot would have to remain vacant regardless of how it was zoned!
Fortunately, the building didn’t burn down when I owned it, but getting insurance
was tough, and I was severely limited in what I could do with the property. It waszoned for multifamily, but I had to convert it back to single family to get the Certificateof Occupancy that’s required before you can lease the property.07_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 58The “cleaner” the package, and more documentation you have, the

Show Me the Money: Identifying
Sources of Ready Cash
When you’re applying for a loan, the lender will ask you to do one
important thing: “Show me the money!” Where will you get the nec-essary cash for the down payment, the closing costs, the pre-paiditems, any repairs or inspections, any third-party fees, or commis-sions? Do you have sufficient cash reserves to cover unexpectedexpenses or income shortfalls?
You need to be able explain and document those sources of avail-
able cash, as we discuss in the following sections.
Sources of cash for down payments,
closing costs, and prepaid items
Although you can usually count on financing the major portion of
the purchase price, you probably need to pay some closing costsand other expenses out of pocket. Your lender wants to know upfront where the money’s going to come from. The money can comefrom just about any source, as long as you have documentation toprove the money exists:
/H12012Checking and savings accounts
/H12012Retirement accounts
/H12012Money from the sale of other properties
/H12012Refinancing or selling other assets
/H12012Commissions
/H12012Bonuses
/H12012Gifts
/H12012New loans
Documentation can include bank or other financial statements,
sales receipts, HUD-1’s from the sale/refinance of real estate, loanagreements, and credit card statements.Chapter 3: Gathering Essential Documents, Facts, and Figures 5907_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 59Rainy day funds: Cash reserves
On most transactions, lenders want to know you have reserves —
cash set aside to cover the cost of unpleasant surprises. Simple
transactions may require two to three months’ cash reserves of themonthly payment or principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI).More-complex transactions may require reserves for constructionallowances, cr edit losses, tenant improvements, and replacement
reserves (for example, for new refrigerators or stoves in apartmentunits). The lender establishes the reserve requirements, and differentlenders have different guidelines for calculating minimum reserves.
The more reserves you have, the better. Even shaky loans get
approved based on a borrower having strong reserves.
Getting Prequalified 
or Preapproved
You’re always in a stronger position to purchase a property at an
attractive price if you have cash or financing in place when makingyour offer. Cash is king. Financing is queen. Having to securefinancing is about a 
2.Because you’re reading a book on financing,
we can safely assume that, like most investors, you don’t have
enough cash on hand to purchase investment properties. The nextbest option is to prequalify or obtain preapproval for a loan:
/H12012Prequalification: Prequalification means a lender or broker has
reviewed your financial records and determined that you would
probably qualify for a particular loan. The lender performs somebasic calculations to determine whether your front-end andback-end debt ratios meet the FHA qualification requirements.
/H12012Preapproval: Preapproval is a more formal, final step in which
the lender obtains all the borrower’s documentation and
underwrites the loan — without a property. With preapproval,the lender agrees to finance the purchase of an investmentproperty up to a certain amount. As long as the property complies with the lender’s standards, the loan is a done deal.
Gaining preapproval puts you in a much stronger position to nego-tiate. To the seller, it’s almost as good as cash. Preapproval is alsomuch better for you as a borrower because it insulates you fromchanging market conditions. You can move quickly on a propertyand lock in an approval even if credit tightens and interest ratesrise. (Chapter 7 leads you through the loan process so you can doeverything necessary to obtain preapproval.)Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 6007_422335-ch03.qxp  3/11/09  11:49 AM  Page 60Chapter 4

To pursue your dream of owning some investment property, you
need some start-up cash. Sure, you can shake all the money
out of your piggy bank and cookie jar, but that probably won’tscore you enough cash to finance your first major acquisition. Youneed serious cash — probably at least 100 grand — and you don’twant to have to go through the neighborhood loan shark to get it.
If you haven’t shopped for money before, you may have the mis-
conception that the answer is simple — just head down to thebank. But as we reveal in this chapter, you have many moreoptions from which to choose. If the bank won’t loan you themoney or offer you a decent deal, maybe someone else will.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the money lenders, including
bankers, brokers, and some less-conventional sorts. You may besurprised at the variety available. In later chapters, we get into thenitty-gritty of actually asking for the money.
Borrowing Directly from Banks
You don’t need a treasure map to locate huge stores of cash. At
just about every major intersection in every town or city, you canfind a bank chock-full of greenbacks. Unfortunately, depending on08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 61Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 62
market conditions, your friendly neighborhood bank may not be as
eager as you might expect to give you the combination to the vault.
But is a bank the best place to go for a loan? Maybe, maybe not. In
the following sections, we weigh the pros and cons of financingthrough a bank and examine the types of loans banks typicallyoffer. After reading through these sections, you should have apretty clear idea of what banks can and can’t do for you as aninvestor.
Weighing the pros and cons
Financing your investments through a bank, particularly the bank
you use to manage your personal finances, may seem like the perfectsolution, at first. It’s probably convenient, you already know some ofthe people, and you feel comfortable doing business with them.
Don’t dismiss any source of financing without first exploring it.
Before you head down to your bank to apply for a loan, however,weigh the pros and cons of borrowing from a bank. You may dis-cover that a bank is the perfect solution for your financing needsor that the perfect solution isn’t so ideal after all.
Pros
Financing your real estate investments through a bank, especially a
local bank, offers several perks, including the following:
/H12012Security and reliability: Federally insured banks are generally
dependable institutions, although even the most solid institu-
tions are vulnerable to bankruptcy.
/H12012Convenience: Banks typically have many branches, which can
give you access to convenient locations when you need assis-
tance or a quick draw from a line of credit to act on an invest-ment opportunity.
/H12012Portfolio lending: Smaller financial institutions, including
banks and credit unions, may be more open to holding loans in
their own portfolios rather than selling them to bigger banksor mortgage companies. This allows them to be more flexibleon interest and terms. However, portfolio lending is usuallyavailable only for short-term (less than three years) loans.
/H12012Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) goals: Banks may be
required by federal law to lend money for certain projects
(including residential and commercial properties) within theirimmediate geographical area. A lucrative rehabilitation invest-ment project can get the green light just because of the bank’sCRA requirements. (For more about the CRA option, check outChapter 9.)08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 62/H12012Insights and guidance: Local banks understand the local real
estate market. They’re aware of trends and market conditions,
and can provide a great deal of insight into the viability of aninvestment property in a specific area. Your banker may justdevelop into your own personal real estate investment advisor.
/H12012Preferential treatment: Although the world may seem to be
becoming more impersonal, relationships still count, espe-
cially when dealing with money. As you develop a relationshipwith people at the bank, especially loan officers and execu-tives, you place yourself in a stronger position to negotiatemore affordable loans.
/H12012Improved access to REO properties: When a bank forecloses
on a mortgage, it often takes possession of the foreclosure
property and transfers it to its Real Estate Owned (REO)department, which then tries to sell the property. If everyone atthe bank knows you as a trustworthy investor, you may have abetter chance of obtaining good deals on these properties.
During economic slowdowns, when credit usually tightens, REO(or bank-owned) properties become more available. In addition,because banks get stuck holding so many of these properties, they’reoften willing to finance purchases. Through careful negotiations, youcan not only buy properties at great prices but also have the bankfinance them. For more about this strategy, check out Chapter 17.
Cons
Although banks offer a host of valuable benefits, they also come
with a few drawbacks, including the following:
/H12012Limited financing options: Unlike brokers, banks don’t help
you shop for loans. They can offer you the loan programs
from their own menu only. They may not even offer certainloans (such as government loans) for particular types of prop-erties. A 
mortgage broker can provide more options by work-
ing with dozens of banks. Check out “Dealing with a
Middleman (or Woman): Brokers” later in this chapter.
/H12012Possible complications: Many banks broker their loans out
(sell them to other lenders or institutions), so you end up
dealing with another lender anyway without reaping any ofthe benefits of working through a broker, such as a faster,hassle-free closing.
/H12012Possible loan processing delays: Many banks rely on hourly
employees to handle loan transactions. As a result, they have no
financial incentive to wrap things up quickly. Mortgage brokers,on the other hand, are paid only when the loan closes. They’retypically paid on a straight commission for producing the loan,so they have an added incentive to see that it closes quickly.Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 6308_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 63Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 64
Conventional loans
Banks typically deal in loans that are considered conventional or
conforming — meaning the loan conforms to all the requirements
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (see the nearby sidebar).
Conventional loans are the bread and butter of residential real
estate financing, particularly for homeowners but also forinvestors. With conventional loans, you can always be sure that
/H12012Capital is available.
/H12012Loan costs and interest rates are generally attractive.
/H12012Interest rates among lenders vary only slightly because the
money is coming from Wall Street through Fannie and Freddie.
Because conventional loans are primarily intended for consumersborrowing money to purchase a home, plenty of information isavailable on how to find the best deals on conventional mortgages.For more information, we recommend 
Mortgages For Dummies, 3rd
Edition, by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown (Wiley). To separate mort-
gage fact from fiction, check out our book Mortgage Myths: 77
Secrets That Will Save You Thousands on Home Financing (Wiley).
Conventional loans are also available for investors, although they
tend to cost more and be more restrictive — with a loan-to-value)usually no higher than 75 percent and 1 to 1.5 points. (For moreabout L TV, see Chapter 3. For information about points, refer toMortgage broker or loan officer?
You’re likely to hear plenty of industry lingo bandied about, but the first two terms
you need to sort out are “mortgage broker” and “loan officer.” A mortgage broker
is a licensed company or professional who assists clients in finding and arranging
financing through lenders. Brokers are regulated by the state. A loan officer may
simply be an individual who works on behalf of a licensed lender or mortgage broker
to facilitate the process. Some states license the individual loan officers as brokers.
For all practical purposes, a loan officer offers the same services as a mortgage
broker but is required by law to work for the licensed broker or lender. It’s sort of likegoing into your doctor’s office and seeing a nurse practitioner — sometimes thepractitioner offers better advice than the doctor even though the practitioner isn’tlicensed to practice medicine.
Of course, you’re usually better off working directly with an experienced broker, but
if you find a great loan officer, you may do just as well or better.08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 64Chapter 6.) As an investor, keep in mind that having access to cash
is often more important than the cost of gaining access.
Subprime (nonconforming) loans
Subprime loans (also known as nonconforming loans ),are the bad
boys of the mortgage lending industry. At least that’s what many
people were led to believe during the great mortgage meltdown inthe late 2000s. Due to some irresponsible underwriting by lendersand irresponsible borrowing on the part of consumers, subprimeloans did contribute to the mortgage meltdown, but that doesn’tmake them all bad. They do serve a useful purpose when usedappropriately.
Subprime loans are everything that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
aren’t. Although some subprime loans known as Alt-A loans can gothrough Fannie and Freddie, most don’t. (An 
Alt-A loan or alterna-
tive A-paper loan is one for which the approval is based primarily
on the borrower’s lower credit score, or other situations such as
self-employment, that increase the risk of repayment.) Instead,subprime loans are usually available through other institutionalinvestors, pension funds, insurance companies, various large andsmall mortgage banking firms, and even individuals.Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 65
Fannie and Freddie who?
The question is more like “Fannie and Freddie what?” Fannie Mae is actually a nick-
name for the FNMA, or Federal National Mortgage Association. Freddie Mac is anickname for FHLMC, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
Both organizations do pretty much the same thing — they purchase residential mort-
gages and then convert the mortgages into securities for sale to Wall Street investors,indirectly financing the purchase of homes. In other words, they sort of act as themiddlemen between banks and Wall Street investors. The end result is that they makemoney readily available for the purchase of homes and other real estate.
Although both institutions began as government-chartered, private companies,
they’re now controlled by the government as a result of the problems they ran intoduring the mortgage meltdown that started in 2008. While we were writing this book,it was still too early to tell whether the end result would be a consolidation, merger,or something else entirely, but whatever happens, Fannie and Freddie should essen-tially function the same way but with more restrictions.08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 65Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 66
Instead of Fannie and Freddie setting the qualifications for these
loans, the market and individual investors lay down the rules anddecide what’s available and to whom. As a result, they can offer amuch greater variety of loan packages that appeal to niche marketsand address specific needs, such as the following:
/H12012Limited-documentation loans make it easier for investors who
don’t have the necessary financial documents (tax returns,pay check stubs, and W-2s) to qualify for loans.
/H12012Hybrid adjustable rate loans can help investors with short-term
financing and cash flow by providing flexibility in interest rates.
/H12012Rehabilitation programs can open doors to investors by 
funding special projects or development in certain areas.
Subprime loans have some drawbacks, particularly if the borrowerdoesn’t fully understand the terms, which can be complicated. Whenshopping for any loan, make sure you’re working with a qualified andtrustworthy professional who can clearly explain your options andthe ramifications of choosing a particular option. In short, know whatyou’re getting into before signing on the dotted line.
One of the main drawbacks of subprime mortgages is that certain
programs can disappear overnight as the appetites of Wall Streetinvestors and consumers change. Numerous creative subprime loanpackages emerged leading up to the mortgage meltdown, and manyof these options disappeared as soon as loan defaults shot up.
Dealing with a Middleman (or
Woman): Mortgage Brokers
A mortgage broker is sort of like a real estate agent, but instead of
helping you find the right house, the broker helps you find the
right loan. Ideally, a broker sits down with you to determine whatyou’re planning on using the money for and then assists you inselecting the lender and loan package that best meets your needs.Through a broker, you gain access to dozens of financing optionsas opposed to the limited few you may find with a local bank.
In the following sections, we discuss the pros and cons of working
through a broker and then show you how to find brokers andresearch their credentials and references.08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 66Weighing the pros and cons
As you probably already guessed, we think that most investors can
benefit by shopping for loans through a broker — a good broker,that is. In the following sections, we list the reasons why. To give abalanced perspective, we also list a couple of reasons why youmay not want to use a broker. Furthermore we give you clues touncovering a good broker and what you can do to verify the brokeris reputable and the right choice for you.
Pros
Mortgage brokers offer a host of benefits for fueling your real
estate purchases and development, including the following:
/H12012Better selection: A broker has access to many different
lenders, each of whom may offer several different loan pack-
ages, so you’re more likely to find a loan that meets yourunique needs.
/H12012Bargaining power: Mortgage brokers can negotiate fees and
terms with large lenders and play one off the other to negoti-
ate the best deal on your behalf.
/H12012Marketplace knowledge: Brokers are more in tune with new
and creative financing programs and options. When new pro-
grams become available, they’re often the first to know.
Although mortgage brokers specialize in the mortgage lending indus-try, many are also very knowledgeable about the real estate market intheir area. In addition, a well-established broker is likely to have con-nections with other investors, local bankers, real estate attorneys,and so forth. Take full advantage of what your broker has to offer.
Cons
Mortgage brokers are sort of like doctors and lawyers — if you find
the right one, you have no reason not to use a broker. However,finding and keeping a qualified broker who’s dedicated to servingyour needs can be quite a challenge. Watch out for the following:
/H12012Lack of experience: Many brokers may not be experienced
enough or large enough to deal with the right lenders. You can
spend a lot of time researching and checking credentials andreferences before you find a great broker.
/H12012High turnover: Brokers can disappear overnight. Becoming a
broker doesn’t require a huge capital investment, so brokers
often come and go. After a long search, you may find a top-notch broker only to discover that several months later theperson is no longer in business. You may end up losing time,money, and a valuable resource.Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 6708_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 67Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 68
Shaking the branches for a broker
Although you can certainly flip through the “Mortgages” section of
the phone-book ads or search the Internet for “mortgage brokersany town, your state USA” to find brokers in your area, these meth-ods don’t focus in on the highest quality prospects. The best wayto find qualified, experienced mortgage brokers is to searchthrough the people who actually borrow money to finance theirreal estate investments — real estate investors.
Obtain referrals from investors in your area, so you know the
broker has experience working with investors and has providedsatisfactory service to at least one person. Most investors will alsotell you which brokers to avoid.
If you don’t know other real estate investors in your area, you have
some work to do. Join a reputable real estate investment club suchas the Rental Property Owners Association (RPOA) and start net-working. (Search the Web for “rental property owners association”followed by your state.) You can pick up plenty of market knowl-edge just by attending meetings and talking with people who’vebeen there and done that.
Checking a broker’s credentials
Ideally, a mortgage broker works on your behalf to find you the
best deal. Unfortunately, brokers don’t have a fiduciary (legal finan-
cial) responsibility to you as the borrower. As a result, some bro-
kers may try to sell you on a loan that brings them a highercommission rather than provide you with a better deal. This is whyfinding a trustworthy broker who has a stellar reputation is soimportant.
In the following sections, we show you how to do your own back-
ground check on mortgage brokers, verify their credentials, andinterview the top three candidates.
Doing a background check
After you have a list of possible candidates, start trimming that list
to three finalists by doing a background check on each candidate:
/H12012Check the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB)
Web site at www.namb.org to make sure the broker is a
member. NAMB members follow a strict code of ethics, tend
to be more dedicated to the profession, and are required to
take continuing education courses.08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 68/H12012Search the Internet for the company’s or individual’s name.
If the candidate has a bad reputation, dissatisfied clients are
likely to post something about it on the Web.
/H12012If the company or individual has a Web site or blog, visit the
site and explore. Make sure the broker deals in both conven-
tional and subprime loans. The more established brokers also
offer government loans, including Federal Housing Authority(FHA) and Veteran’s Administration (VA) loans. (Check out thesection “Borrowing from Uncle Sam: Government LoanPrograms” later in this chapter for these types of loans.)
/H12012Visit your state’s Web site and verify that the broker is
licensed in your state. If you can’t find your state’s Web site,
call the licensing board in your state capital. All 50 states have
licensing requirements for mortgage lenders. Some states havelicensing for individuals as well. Check for any administrativeactions or sanctions, or complaints (many complaints aren’tpublic unless the department of licensing takes action). Youmay also want to check your state attorney general’s Web site.
/H12012Check the Better Business Bureau (BBB) for any complaints.
Start at the national Web site’s home page at ( www.bbb.org ),
which can direct you to the Web site for your local branch.
/H12012Contact your local chamber of commerce to determine
whether the broker is a member in good standing. Being an
established member of the local business community is
always a big plus.
/H12012Contact each broker who’s made the first cut and obtain
three references from investors and three references fromreal estate agents the broker has worked with.
(Make sure
the real estate agents are well-established in the community,
not just part-timers.) Call the references and ask about theirexperience working with the broker.
Don’t just go with the broker who has the largest ad in the phone
book or the local newspaper. Check their credentials with the state
licensing board, the BBB, and the state attorney general’s office forcomplaints and/or regulatory actions or sanctions.
Interviewing the top candidates
After you’ve chopped your list of candidates down to three, call to
set up an interview with each of them. During the interview, besure to ask the following questions:
/H12012How long have you been in business? You’re looking for
someone who’s been a broker for at least a couple of years.
/H12012How many transactions do you process in a year? Good bro-
kers average at least 40 to 50 transactions per year. SomeoneChapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 6908_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 69Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 70
who processes way fewer than average may lack motivation.
A broker who processes way more may not be careful enough.
/H12012What percentage of your transactions are conventional,
non-conventional, and government loans? Brokers generally
deal with far more conventional loans, but look for a broker
who has experience with all three types.
/H12012What percentage of your transactions are investor loans?
Brokers who do a substantial percentage of their business
with investors are usually a better choice than those whoexclusively serve consumers/homeowners.
/H12012How many lenders do you work with? Generally speaking,
the more the merrier. The more lenders the broker has access
to, the wider the selection of loan packages.
/H12012What’s your specialty? Just as real estate agents specialize in
certain types of homes, mortgage brokers specialize in certain
types of loans (such as government loans, first-time homebuyers, construction loans, and so on). Choose a broker whospecializes in the types of loans that best fit your investmentstrategy. (See Chapters 5 and 9 for descriptions of differentresidential and commercial loan types.)
/H12012What are your application fee requirements? Determine how
much money the mortgage broker charges upfront at the time
of application and what those fees are applied toward.Compare costs among the brokers and make sure they’reapplying any fees to real services rather than pocketing themas extra money.
/H12012What’s your policy on locking in interest rates? Does locking
in a rate cost extra? How long does the rate remain locked?
How soon before closing does the rate have to be locked?
/H12012What’s your refund policy for cancelled loan applications?
Some brokers actually charge upfront fees up to $1,000 or
more if you cancel a loan application. You’re better off know-ing about it now than when you need to cancel an application.
During the interview, make sure you get along with the broker andthat your personalities match up pretty well. If this is a good fit,you’ll be working together for some time. You want somebody youcan get along with.
Taking the Hard-Money Route
through Private Lenders
Hard money is called “hard” for a reason — it’s hard to get, hard to
pay, and generally costs more than your average loan. Hard money08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 70comes from individuals or small groups of private investors who
like to obtain a high return on their money and are willing to takesome additional risk in order to get it.
Because hard money costs more, you may wonder why anyone on
earth would even consider it. Just like any other type of invest-ment method, hard money has its upsides and downsides. Hardmoney offers several benefits:
/H12012More financing options: You gain access to cash you may not
be able to get through a conventional lender. Hard money
loans typically cost more in points upfront and interest, butthe terms can be more flexible than with conventional loans.
/H12012More collateral options: Hard-money lenders often accept the
future value (after renovations) of a property as collateral, so
you don’t have to borrow against other assets, like your home.
/H12012More flexibility: You can often close the transaction faster, with
less paperwork, and even set up a separate escrow account
with a hard money lender to pay for repairs and renovations.
/H12012Less intrusion into your business: Banks tend to be more
intrusive, wanting more information about the business oper-
ation than a hard money investor does. The hard-moneylender sets a lower L TV requirement, so you have less equityrisk from the start. Even so, hard-money lenders do want toknow the plan for repayment and see a business plan if it’scontingent on a business tenancy arrangement.
On the flipside, hard money does have a few significant drawbacks:
/H12012Higher cost: Sometimes gaining access to cash, whatever the
cost, is good investment decision — as long as you account
for that cost in your calculations and can still turn the profityou want.
/H12012Lower ratios: Another disadvantage of hard-money loans is
that the L TV’s (loan-to-value ratios) are typically lower. For
example, instead of being able to borrow 80 to 90 percent ofthe value of the property, you may only be able to borrow 65to 75 percent. However, hard-money lenders are often willingto make the calculations on the future value of the property.For more about using hard money to finance your real estateinvestments, check out Chapter 11.
Hard-money lenders may be more willing to negotiate withinvestors, especially investors who have a solid track record. Somelenders, for instance, may charge three or four points upfront toreduce their exposure to the risk of an early default but then agreeto refund one or two points when you’ve paid off the loan.Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 7108_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 71Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 72
Borrowing from Uncle Sam:
Government Loan Programs
The housing market plays an important role in driving the econ-
omy, so the U.S. government does what it can to support this keyindustry. One of the primary support mechanisms are government(or government-secured) loans made available to first-time homebuyers. If you’re like most Americans, you probably used an FHA(Federal Housing Administration) or VA (Veterans Administration)loan to purchase your first home.
Through the FHA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) also offers loans to homeowners andinvestors to assist in rehabilitating properties. Government loansare designed to help the marketplace in areas where the privatesector can’t. After Hurricane Katrina, for example, several govern-ment programs came to the rescue, encouraging investors to assistin rebuilding the damaged areas. Special grants and state and fed-eral loan programs gave investors access to cash that the banksand private sector wouldn’t or couldn’t offer.
In most cases, the government steers clear of lending money
directly to homeowners and investors. Instead, the government
secures the loans. If the borrower fails to pay back the loan, the
government steps in, picks up the tab, takes the property, and tries
to sell it to recoup its loss. Additionally, most government programsare limited to owner-occupied properties.
As a homeowner, you’re already aware of some of the benefits that
government-secured loans offer homeowners, but governmentloans can also benefit investors in two important ways:
/H12012Understanding government loans can enable you to flip the
property to a buyer down the road. For example, the Good
Neighbor Next Door loan (GNND) enables qualified buyers
(including teachers, law-enforcement professionals, and fire-
fighters) to purchase certain HUD homes with only a $100down payment, or even some HUD repo’s at half price; 
203(k)
loans help an owner rehabilitate a property, pay for additions,
and even purchase new appliances. Using the GNND loan and
a 203k loan, a qualified investor can actually buy a home forhalf its market value with a $100 down payment and then sellit several years down the road to earn a handsome profit.
/H12012You may be able to purchase government-owned properties
directly (usually those foreclosed on due to nonpayment of anFHA or VA loan) and finance the purchase through the govern-ment agency.08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 72For more about using specific government-sponsored loan pro-
grams to finance real estate purchases and rehabilitation, seeChapter 5.
Financing through the Seller
Before most homeowners can pack up and move, they have to sell
their homes and pay off their current mortgages so they can affordto buy their new homes. Homeowners who’ve paid off their mort-gages or have sufficient cash available, however, don’t need the fullpurchase price upfront. They can sell you the home and 
finance
the purchase. In other words, the seller becomes the bank.
If a seller is willing and able, you can often purchase the property
on contract through a lease option agreement or a land contract.The contract takes the place of the mortgage document that mostbuyers sign when they close on a house. In the following sections,we explain how these contracts work. For more about the pros andcons of financing through the seller and the nitty gritty of how toharness the power of seller financing, check out Chapter 12.
Lease options
A lease option agreement is sort of a rent-to-own deal. You rent the
property from the owner for a fixed period (usually no more than a
few years), at the end of which time you have the option to buy theproperty. Normally, the seller requires some sort of down payment(often less than a typical mortgage lender requires), which shouldbe applied to the purchase price, along with monthly rent equiva-lent to about 1 percent of the purchase price.
A lease option agreement can be a great way to finance the pur-
chase of an investment property, assuming you’re working with aseller who deals aboveboard, and you have a great plan in placefor obtaining cash or alternative financing by the time your optionto buy the property rolls around.
So how does a lease option work? The monthly payment consists
of rent plus some additional money that’s applied to the purchaseprice. In other words, if the going rate for rent on the property is$1,000 per month, you may have a monthly payment of, say, $1,500with the extra $500 being added to your down payment. Thisensures that you’re building equity in the property during the leasepart of the agreement, and it provides the seller/lender with somesecurity in the event that you back out of the deal.Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 7308_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 73Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 74
Make sure that the lease option agreement is very specific regard-
ing the application of payments and terms of exercising your
option. Otherwise, you may lose a lot of money in rent that youassumed was being applied to the purchase price or lose youroption to buy on some minor technicality. Have a qualified realestate attorney look over the agreement before you sign it, andmake sure you understand it completely.
Land contracts
With a land contract (also called a contract for deed ), the seller
essentially functions as a bank, so you’re cutting out the middle-
man. In most cases, you handle the transaction through a rep-utable escrow company. The deed is held in escrow, and you makepayments to the escrow company. When you’ve finally paid theloan in full, the escrow company releases the deed to you.
Land contracts are often win-win situations, benefiting both the
seller and the investor:
/H12012The seller profits not only from the sale of the property but
also from the interest the buyer is paying. They earn invest-ment income generated by an asset they know and love —their own real estate.
/H12012The investor benefits by not having to pay a lot in closing
costs and being able to obtain a loan without having to jumpthrough hoops for a bank or mortgage company. With theincreased cash flow, an investor can obtain more propertiesby using this strategy.
Make absolutely sure that payments are handled by a servicingcompany — 
notby the seller — and that the deed is placed into
escrow. The last thing you want is to make payments for seven
years, only to find out that the underlying mortgage wasn’t paid,the property has a tax lien against it, and the seller is nowhere tobe found to sign off on the deed! Been there, done that, not goingback for seconds.
Teaming Up with a 
Cash-Heavy Partner
Successful partnerships begin with individuals whose needs and
offerings complement one another — in other words, when onepartner has what the other needs, and vice versa. People who haveplenty of cash often don’t have plenty of time, talent, and motivation08_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 74to purchase, renovate, and manage real estate, and they really don’t
have to — they can hire someone else to do it for them. This iswhere you come in as an investor. You have (or should have) theknow-how. All you need is the money.
In the following sections, we introduce you to various ways to
structure a partnership that typically work well in real estate. InChapter 13, we go a little deeper to show you how to partner withthe right individual(s).
Opting for a limited partnership
A limited partnership is called “limited” for a very good reason —
the liability protection (none) and tax benefits (insignificant) of a
partnership are very limited. Legal actions against one partner canlead to actions against all partners, and each partner can be heldpersonally liable for actions of the partnership as a group. In otherwords, if you’re going to partner up with someone, you really needto form the partnership inside the protective bubble of a corpora-tion, as discussed in the following section.
Limited partnerships do offer a few benefits. They’re
/H12012Easy to set up
/H12012Inexpensive
/H12012Simple to manage for the few involved parties
You can set up a limited partnership with two or more people
(including yourself) on a per-property basis or to invest in multipleproperties. Just make sure you have all the terms of the partnership
in writing . The agreement should address the following three areas:
/H12012Partner responsibilities: Spell out what each partner is
responsible for — supplying capital, finding and buying real
estate, making repairs and renovations, marketing and sellingthe property, and so on.
/H12012Profit sharing: Specify how profits from the real estate ven-
tures are going to be split.
/H12012Dissolution: Stipulate how you’re going to divide any cash
and other assets if you decide to dissolve the partnership
later. Yeah, we know — when forming a partnership, the lastthing you want to think about is the possibility that it will end,but it’s better to come to an agreement now when you’refriends than later when you’re at each others’ throats (hope-fully, that doesn’t happen).Chapter 4: Scoping Out Prospective Lenders 7508_422335-ch04.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 75Part I: Gearing Up for Financing Your Real Estate Investments 76
Have an attorney draw up the partnership agreement and explain
the terms to everyone involved. Each partner should have his ownlegal representation to ensure that his interests are protected.
If you’re forming a corporation, a partnership agreement is still
very useful in clarifying each partner’s responsibilities. If youdecide not to use a written agreement, at least make sure that yourcorporation papers clearly explain how distributions will beapplied — usually determined by shareholder percentage of own-ership and disclosed on the K-1 (the tax schedule showing the totalannual payments, deductions, and credits to the shareholder).
Going the corporation route
Even if you happen to form a partnership with one or more other
individuals, managing your partnership as a corporation offers
additional benefits in terms of taxes and liability protection. You
have three options here:
/H12012LLC: A limited liability corporation (LLC) limits your exposure
to risk. If someone takes legal action against the corporation,
your personal assets are protected. For most investors, werecommend forming an LLC, as discussed in Chapter 2.
/H12012Sub-S corp: A Sub-S corp (short for Subchapter S corporation)
also limits your exposure to risks and allows for pass-through
taxation (unlike a C-corp). With pass-through taxation, the cor-
poration’s profits pass through to your individual income tax
return, avoiding double-taxation (in which both you and your
corporation are taxed). Only individuals, not other business
entities, can own a Sub-S corp, and the corporation can have amaximum of 75 shareholders. With a Sub-S, you run the risk ofthe IRS forcing it into C-corp status (described in the followingbullet) if the corporation shows as having too much 
passive
income (income you don’t really do anything to earn, such as
rental income, that’s taxed at a lower rate than earned income ).
/H12012C-corp: A C-corp (short for Chapter C corporation) also limits
your personal liability, but we don’t recommend going the C-
corp route for most real estate investors. First, you need tohave at least 75 shareholders or establish a real estate invest-ment trust (REIT), as discussed in Chapter 2. A C-corp alsoexposes you to double-taxation, which can really take a biteout of your profits.
A Sub-S corporation is simple to establish and file for, but makesure to file for the Sub-S election with the IRS right away after form-ing the corporation. For more about forming and managing a cor-poration, check out

Finding the Residential Loan
Program That’s Right for You
In This Chapter
/H17075Understanding why choosing the right loan is so crucial
/H17075Focusing more on cash flow than on loan costs and interest
/H17075Checking out what your government can do for you
/H17075Dodging prepayment penalties
Consumers have hundreds of different residential loan programs
to choose from, including zero-down-payment programs, 40-
and 50-year terms, interest-only loans, and complicated adjustable-rate mortgages that can double your payment overnight! In addition,investors may have access to government financing through rehabil-itation loans, renaissance loans, and even grants for redevelopment.With so many types of loans and other financing to choose from,how do you pick the type that’s best for you as an investor?
This chapter introduces you to the most common residential loan
types, explains how each program works, and guides you in choos-ing the right type of loan for your investment needs.
The market is in constant flux, so new mortgage programs are con-
stantly being introduced while obsolete programs are being phasedout. In writing this chapter, we’ve tried our best to provide informa-tion that’s detailed enough to be useful, but general enough toaccommodate market changes.
Understanding Why Finding the
Right Residential Loan Is Key
You’re not the only one who wants to earn a buck off real estate.
Lenders want to earn their keep, too, so they charge all sorts of10_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 79interest, fees, and penalties. As an investor working through one of
these lenders, you have two primary goals:
/H12012Gain access to cash. You need cash to do deals. Check out the
following section, “Choosing a Loan Type to Maximize Your
Cash Flow” for more information.
/H12012Pay as little as possible for access to that cash. After all, the
more you pay in interest, fees, and penalties, the less money
you walk away with at the end of the day.
In order to meet these two goals, you want to locate the right resi-dential loan. To help you know what’s available, throughout thischapter we roll out a veritable smorgasbord of loan types so youcan home in on the type that sounds best for a particular deal.Another key to locating the right loan is to examine 
allthe pros
and cons of each available loan before making a selection. We
cover this important step in Chapter 6.
When searching for the right residential loan, you also need to know
the difference between residential and commercial loans. Residential
mortgage loans finance the purchase of properties that people live
in — single-family homes, multifamily dwellings, apartment buildings,condos, and co-ops. 
Commercial loans finance the purchase of prop-
erties that house businesses. With residential loans, lenders typically
examine the ability of the borrower to make payments and eventually
pay back the loan. With commercial properties, lenders give more
weight to the building’s ability to produce sufficient income. (See Part
III for more about financing the purchase of commercial properties.)
Choosing a Loan Type to Maximize
Your Cash Flow
When most folks buy a home to live in, the main ingredients they’re
looking at in a mortgage loan are interest rate, term (number of years
to pay off the loan), and monthly payment. They want a monthly
mortgage payment they can afford without paying an exorbitantamount of interest over the life of the loan.
As an investor, your needs are different. Your primary goal is to gain
access to cash, even if you have to pay more to gain that access.The interest rate, terms, and payment matter only as they relate toyour all-important cash flow. As a result, the criteria you use forcomparing loans are likely to differ a great deal from the criteriayou use to select a mortgage for a primary residence.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 80 Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 10_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 80We toss the term cash flow around quite a bit and even use it as a
verb, as in “Wow, this property really cash flows!” So what is cash
flow, exactly? Cash flow simply means that the property is bringing
in more cash than is going out each month. If your property is losing
money, it has a negative cash flow . . . and you have problems.
When you’re more focused on gaining access to financing than
worrying about the cost of financing, your options suddenly multi-ply. You can begin to consider loans that you would otherwise dis-miss outright as costing too much. In addition, you can begin toexplore a host of options that aren’t available to the average home-owner, such as rehabilitation loans.
In the following sections, we show you how cash flow enables you
to leverage the power of using other people’s money to financeyour investments and introduce you to a few types of loans thatcan maximize the cash you have available for investments.
The power of OPM (other 
people’s money)
One of the secrets to maximizing your investment profits is to use
as little of your own money and as much of other people’s money(OPM) as possible. By using OPM, you stretch your investmentdollar — you can buy more and better properties and increaseyour profit potential as a result.
Whenever you finance the purchase of a property, rather than paying
cash with your own money, you’re using OPM. Throughout this book,we reveal various sources of OPM, including bank loans, government-secured loans, hard-money lenders, small-business loans, and so on.We introduce the concept of OPM here, so you have a better under-standing of why you want to borrow money (rather than using allyour own money) to purchase real estate. After you grasp the concept of OPM and understand the leverage it gives you, you’rebetter prepared to begin evaluating the sources of OPM.
The magic of using OPM is in the numbers, as the following 
examples reveal:
/H12012You invest $100,000 cash to buy, renovate, and sell a house for
$120,000. You just made a 20 percent profit ($20,000 profitdivided by your investment of $100,000 equals 20 percent).
/H12012You invest $20,000, borrowing the other $80,000 to buy, reno-
vate, and sell a house for $120,000. You just made a 100 percentprofit ($20,000 profit divided by your investment of $20,000equals 100 percent).Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 8110_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 81In these examples, you earn five times more profit percentage-wise
by using other people’s money, even though you earn the sameprofit in terms of dollar amount. You may argue that you still endup with $20,000 in your pocket either way. But say you have $100,000to invest, as in the first example. Instead of buying one property with$100,000, you can divvy it up into $20,000 chunks to buy five $100,000properties (borrowing $80,000 for each). You now control $1,000,000worth of real estate and when you sell the properties, you earn$20,000 each for a total profit of $100,000!
Borrowing money is always risky, but you have to take some risk.
Throughout this book, we show you ways to reduce the risk, butunforeseen events can undermine the best-laid plans. As a realestate investor, you need to decide for yourself whether the poten-tial benefits outweigh the risks.
The following sections reveal some loan types that can free up
more of your own money and maximize the use of OPM.
Interest-only mortgages
An interest-only loan is just what it sounds like; if you take out an
interest-only loan for $100,000, in two years, after making 24 inter est-
only payments, you still owe $100,000. Sound like a bum deal?Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 82
Did I overpay for that loan?
Several years ago, I (Chip) obtained a mortgage for a two-family duplex at 9.50 per-
cent interest, and paid 3 points to get it. The market rate for mortgages was about6 percent at the time, and qualified home buyers were usually able to secure a mort-gage without paying any points. Most people would have thought I was crazy.
Was I?Crazy like a fox, maybe. I needed a loan to purchase an investment property, and
because the property had been severely neglected and in disrepair, the type of loanI needed wasn’t readily available in the marketplace. Without cash, I couldn’t do thedeal, so I was willing to pay a premium to gain access to the cash I needed. It was justa short-term solution until I could make some repairs to the point that the propertybecame eligible for more-conventional (and less-expensive) financing. But the cashflow made it very attractive (and profitable) — even at the higher interest rate.
When financing real estate investments, you have to remember to stop thinking like
an average homeowner and start thinking like an investor. Put your investor cap onwhen examining the terms and make sure the cash flow works for the propertyyou’re planning on buying.10_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 82It may be, if you plan on living in your home for 15 years and the
value of the home doesn’t appreciate significantly. But if you’reusing the loan for a quick flip, it may be perfect. You pay off the loanin full right after you sell the house. In the meantime, you have moreinvestment capital to put toward renovations or other properties.
The key to using interest-only loans wisely is in making sure the
property provides a positive cash flow — enough revenue to morethan cover all your costs, including the monthly interest you’repaying, and the value of the property is stable or rising. When considering interest-only loans, be aware of the following:
/H12012Most interest-only loans are adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs),
so carefully check the adjustment period, index, margin, andcap. (For more about ARMs, check out the following section.)
/H12012Rarely is an interest-only loan interest-only for the life of the
loan. Read the fine print to determine when and how youmust pay the principle. Some loans require a lump-sum pay-ment three to five years down the road. They suck you in withlow monthly payments early and then sock you with huge billslater. This fake-out may be devastating to the average home-owner, but if you know about it and plan for it, an interest-onlyloan can be your ticket to a profitable investment property.
Nobody can judge a loan type as good or bad without consideringhow the investor uses the loan to finance the investment. If a no-interest loan frees up some cash so you can complete the repairsand renovations on a property more quickly, the fact that yourentire payment was going only toward interest matters very little.
Grabbing a hold of ARMs
Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) have interest rates that fluctu-
ate. You may take out a loan for 5 percent and find yourself paying8 percent the following year. Even so, ARMs can play a valuablerole in your investment strategy. They’re often easier to qualify for,and if you can sell the property or refinance the loan before therate jumps, you may be able to avoid any huge increases in interestand payments.
As was revealed during the great foreclosure crisis that began in
2008, ARMs are risky business for most homeowners. Tight creditcan undermine your plans to sell or refinance. In the meantime,your monthly payment increases could make the property un-affordable. Realize that when you take out an ARM, you’re taking agamble. To minimize your exposure to risk, figure out the worst-case scenario and plan accordingly.Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 8310_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 83When shopping for ARMs, examine the following factors to deter-
mine the worst-case scenario:
/H12012Initial interest rate: The interest rate when you sign for the
loan. This is usually a teaser rate to make the initial payments
more attractive.
/H12012Adjustment period: The frequency at which the rate can go
up or down. This is typically one, three, or five years but can
also be months rather than years.
/H12012Index: ARMs are tied to an index that typically rises or falls
based on government lending rates. Ask which index the lender
uses, how often it changes, and how it has performed in thepast. Several indexes are considered standard, including theTreasury index, the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR),the Cost of Funds Index (COFI), the Prime Rate, various T-Bills,and the Fed Funds Rate.
The Treasury index is always a little safer and secure and is the
most common. Take some time to look up whatever index yourlender uses, and make sure you can find it in 
The Wall Street
Journal (the financial rates section) or a similar publication.
/H12012Margin: The percentage above the index that the lender
charges — think of it as a markup. For example, if the index 
is at 3 percent and the margin is 2 percent, you pay 5 percentinterest. If the index rises two percentage points to 5 percent, youpay 7 percent interest. The margin remains the same through-out the life of the mortgage.
/H12012Cap: The highest interest rate the lender can charge, no matter
how high the index rises. So if the lender sets the cap at 9 per-
cent, you never pay more than 9 percent interest, no matterhow high the index goes. The lender likely will quote a yearlycap and a lifetime cap as, for example, “2/6”, which means therate can go up 2 percent per year (or per adjustment), and 6 percent over the life of the loan.
Make sure you understand all the possible adjustments that cantake place and calculate the payments under a worst-case sce-nario. Plug this number into your 
pro forma calculations (your pro-
jections) to make sure that your property will still cash flow under
the worst of circumstances. We can’t stress enough the need to doyour homework, and possibly consult your highly qualified andtrusted mortgage broker before selecting an ARM.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 8410_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 84Hybrids
A hybrid loan is a combination of an ARM and a fixed-rate loan.
With a hybrid term, the interest rate remains fixed for a certain
number of years, after which time the rate is adjustable. For exam-ple, with a 3/1 hybrid, the interest rate remains fixed for 3 yearsand then becomes an adjustable-rate loan in which the rate can beadjusted every year. A 2/28 hybrid has a fixed interest rate for thefirst 2 years and then adjusts each year for the next 28 years.
These types of loans are better suited for situations in which you
plan on holding the property for at least a couple of years beforeselling it and you’re fairly certain that interest rates won’t dropover the next couple years. If you’re planning on selling the prop-erty quickly, an adjustable rate mortgage with a low introductoryinterest rate may be a better choice. (See the previous section formore on adjustable rate mortgages.) On the other hand, if you planon holding the property for longer than a couple of years, a fixed-rate mortgage may be more appealing.
The main advantage of a hybrid over a straight ARM is that it pro-
vides, at least for a time, a guaranteed fixed interest rate, whichcan help you establish more reliable cash flow projections for theduration of the fixed-interest term. You still need to be careful,however; hybrid loans can turn into time bombs if your projectionsare based on unrealistic assumptions. An unexpectedly steep jumpin the interest rate can quickly create a negative cash flow.
Hard-money loans: Private investors
When easy money is unavailable (money from financial institu-
tions), you can always turn to hard -money lenders — private
investors who offer loans that typically charge several points
upfront, use higher-than-average interest rates, and require pay-ment in full after only a few years.
Why would any investor in her right mind even consider a hard-
money loan? Because you gotta have cash to do a deal, and some-times hard money is the only money you can get your hands on.For more about financing your real estate investments with hardmoney, turn to Chapter 11.Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 8510_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 85Taking Advantage of Government-
Secured Loans
You may be able to hit up your rich Uncle Sam for a loan to finance
your real estate investments (refer to Chapter 4 for more on howgovernment loans work). Although the government rarely loansmoney directly, especially to investors, it often secures loans solending institutions can make the money available without exposingthemselves to huge risks. (If a borrower defaults on a government-secured loan, the government pays the difference and sells thehome to recoup at least part of its loss.)
Although many government loans are available only to finance 
the purchase of 
owner-occupied properties (properties that the
borrower/homeowner is going to live in), in some cases you can
also use these programs to finance the purchase, repairs, and renovations of investment properties.
In the following sections, we describe a host of government pro-
grams that may be available to you depending on your investmentstrategy and the property you’re planning to purchase. We also show you how to go about tapping into these government-sponsored resources.
Tapping the FHA for a loan
Although the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) works with mort-
gage lenders to make loans available primarily to first-time homebuyers, some FHA programs are open to investors. These loans candirectly benefit you by providing government-secured financing forinvestment properties, especially if you’re investing in residentialreal estate and multifamily housing. The FHA is the federal govern-ment’s way of promoting the American Dream of homeownership.
As an investor, these programs can also benefit you indirectly —
you can often use FHA loans to assist prospective buyers in financ-ing the purchase of an investment property you’re selling. One ofthe biggest obstacles preventing first-time buyers from purchasinga home is their inability to qualify for a conventional mortgage.FHA loans make qualifying much easier for them.
If you’re working with a well-qualified mortgage broker (see
Chapter 4) who has experience working with investors, she candirect you to FHA loan programs that you may be able to qualifyPart II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 8610_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 86for as an investor. The same is true if you’re working directly with a
lender who handles FHA loans.
To get more information about FHA loans and other programs
straight from the source, visit the FHA Web site at www.fha.gov ,
where you can find information about the Good Neighbor Next
Door program (described in Chapter 4), special loans for financingthe development of multifamily housing and medical centers,streamlined FHA mortgages, 203(k) loans, and much more.
If you decide to sell a property you own, you can often attract
more buyers if you advertise that you accept FHA financing. Alsooffer to put prospective buyers in touch with your mortgage broker,who can help them determine whether they qualify for an FHA loan.In addition to helping the buyers, your broker can screen out any
looky-loos (casual browsers) who may not be able to afford the
property.
If you’re looking to invest in residential real estate, you may be
able to turn to one of the following FHA loans. Check carefully(your lender or broker can assist you) because they have strictguidelines.
FHA 203(b) loans
FHA 203 loans are designed for first-time homebuyers and people
who don’t have a lot of money for a down payment. Investors canutilize these loans to help their potential buyers finance the pur-chase of their residential real estate, or to acquire and occupy amultifamily property. (You’d have to occupy at least one of theunits in a multifamily property.) During the writing of this book,FHA 203b loans
/H12012Are available only for owner-occupied, one- to four-family
homes
/H12012Allow borrowers to obtain a loan for up to 96.5 percent loan-
to-value (L TV) ,meaning they can purchase a home with a
down payment of as little as 3.5 percent of the property’s
market value
/H12012Are assumable for a new purchaser, meaning the owner can
get out from under the loan by arranging to have a buyer pick
up the payments
FHA offers another program that you may find useful as an investor:
streamline refinancing . This program enables you to lower your
interest rate on a previous FHA loan with low or no out-of-pocket
costs faster and with less documentation than most other refinanceloans. For example, if you purchased a home with a $100,000 FHAChapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 8710_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 87loan as a home buyer a couple of years ago, moved out, and now
use the home as an investment property, you may be able to refi-nance at a lower interest rate through this program. Even better,you can refinance all the way back up to the original loan amount(about $100,000 in this example) without obtaining a new appraisal,and roll all costs into the new loan — including any points you maypay to lower the rate.
Title I loans
Title I loans are available only for owner-occupied properties to
enable homeowners to finance the cost of repairs and renovations
up to $25,000.
Title I loans are great for investors who want to flip the property
they’re living in but don’t have the cash on hand to bring the prop-erty up to market conditions. In a situation like this, you can usethe Title I loan in either of the following ways:
/H12012Take out the Title I loan yourself to pay for repairs and 
renovations before placing the property on the market.
/H12012Place the home on the market as is (at a lower asking price)
and let potential buyers know about the Title I loan they cantake out to cover the cost of repairs and renovations afterthey take possession.
FHA 203(k) loans
FHA 203(k) loans are similar to Title I loans in that they’re avail-
able only for owner-occupied properties and they allow the owner
to finance the cost of repairs and renovations. The difference isthat 203(k) loans allow the cost of 
major repairs to be combined
with the purchase price of the property.
This program is ideal for investors who want to purchase a property,
live in it while they’re making repairs and renovations, and then sellit. Just make sure you don’t overimprove the property and improveyourself right out of a profit. Also, your intent has to be to live in thehouse for at least 12 months as a primary residence.
For example, if a home is worth $100,000 now but would be worth
$150,000 all fixed up, you can obtain an FHA 203(k) loan for the full $150,000 upfront, take your time completing the repairs andrenovations, and then sell the property after you’ve lived in it forat least 12 months total.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 8810_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 88Multifamily loans
For larger residential properties, FHA does offer a multifamily pro-
gram that allows investors to purchase and rehabilitate apartmentcomplex–type properties. You can often combine the FHA loanwith other government grants or subsidies for improvements, taxcredit, or rental payments such as the Section 8 program.

Viewing Veterans Affairs 
(VA) loans
As one of the perks for serving in the military, the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers veterans zero-down financing to pur-chase owner-occupied one- to four-family properties. If you’re aveteran, these loans are often the best deal in town. As an investor,you can often leverage the power of VA financing when you decideto sell a property — these loans give you access to another pool ofpotential buyers.
Although VA loans are generally available only to veterans, even
investors who aren’t veterans can often obtain VA financing to pur-chase foreclosure properties that the VA owns.
Any mortgage broker or lender who handles VA loans can assist
you in determining whether you qualify for one of the programs. Yourbroker may also be able to work with any prospective buyers (if youdecide to sell the property) to determine whether they qualify for a VA loan, which may make the property more affordable to them.For more about VA loans, visit the VA’s Web site at 
www.va.gov
and then click “Benefits, Home Loans.”
Considering REO loans
Real Estate Owned (REO) property is typically property repos-
sessed by the bank after foreclosure. The bank now has to sell the
property to recoup the remaining portion of the unpaid debt. Withgovernment-secured (FHA and VA) loans, the government agencythat secured the loan gets stuck with the property.
Ideally, the government or bank that owns the REO wants someone
to show up with cash and buy the property, but sometimes eagercash-heavy investors are few and far between. To add a little extraChapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 8910_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 89motivation, the owner of the REO property may offer to finance its
purchase, sometimes offering very attractive deals and perhapseven the ever-elusive no-money down deal. These deals can beideal for an investor because you can pick up the property at agreat price 
andsecure attractive financing in one fell swoop.
To obtain an REO loan, first find one or more properties that you
want to purchase from a bank or government agency and then con-tact that agency and ask whether it’s willing to finance the purchase.Experienced investors who have a proven track record of getting(and keeping) bad loans off the books have a better chance ofobtaining this sort of financing. After all, the government or bankdoesn’t want to have to foreclose on the same property again.
For more in-depth information about REOs, check out our book
Foreclosure Investing For Dummies (Wiley).
One of the best times to pursue REO’s is when the housing market
is in a slump and foreclosures are on the rise, as we discuss inChapter 17.
Tapping into state and 
local grants and loans
State and local governments often identify certain target areas
(such as rundown downtown districts, renaissance zones, andother areas in need of a pick-me-up) for redevelopment. They thenoffer incentives — usually in the form of state or local grants or low-interest loans — to get investors like you involved in pitching in.
State and local grant and loan programs rarely get you 
allthe
money you need to purchase and rehab a property. They’re
intended as add-on programs, typically used in conjunction withother loans. Here we describe the most common types of state andlocal programs you’re likely to find:
/H12012State housing development authorities: Meant to encourage
redevelopment in areas like Detroit or areas hit by disasters
such as hurricanes, state housing development authoritiesoften sell bonds to make money available to both homeown-ers and investors. They also fund special first-time homebuyer programs and foreclosure rescue grant programs.
/H12012Renaissance zones: Great for investors, renaissance zones are
areas that federal, state, and/or local governments have
declared tax-free (or tax-lite) to encourage development. Inthese zones, investors can secure loans with significantlylower monthly payments, sometimes saving hundreds orPart II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 9010_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 90thousands of dollars per month. It’s like getting an interest-
free loan, which dramatically increases your cash flow.
/H12012Economic development department: To encourage develop-
ment within certain areas, many larger cities have economic
development departments that provide tax breaks, invest-ment funding, capital expansion funds, construction, or reha-bilitation grants to projects within their district.
/H12012Grants and specific use loans: States, local governments, and
some nonprofit agencies often provide loans or grants for
improvement projects — such as health care facilities,women’s shelters, and emergency housing — designed to addvalue to specific areas.
If your property is located in an area flagged for development ormeets the state or local program’s criteria, contact the state hous-ing development authority, the city housing agency, and any non-profit housing agencies to find out about available funds and whatyou need to do to qualify.
Start researching at the top — HUD’s Web site at 
www.hud.gov . Here
you can search for information by state, find out about economic
development programs and grants, type in the address of a propertyto determine whether it’s located in an enterprise zone, and dis-cover other community networks and programs that can assist youin rebuilding communities while earning a profit for yourself.
To find state-level programs, head to your state’s housing authority
Web site. To find it, use your favorite Web search tool to search foryour state’s name followed by “housing authority.” Your county,city, or town may also have its own housing authority, so use thesame strategy to search for it. The Public Housing DirectorsAssociation (PHDA) also has a directory of members, which youcan access by visiting 
www.phada.org and clicking the “Housing
Authority Websites” link.Chapter 5: Finding the Right Residential Loan Program 91
REO financing in action
The first foreclosure I (Chip) ever purchased was a vacant two-family dwelling,
which I bought for $500 down and simply had to pay the balance of the previousloan. The seller, the Bank of Florida, financed the purchase over a five-year term. Noqualifying, no closing costs!
We can’t guarantee that a bank or government agency will be willing to finance the
purchase for you, but it’s certainly worth a try. You never know if you never ask.10_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 91Many mortgage brokers who are approved by their State Housing
Development Authority can also provide valuable assistance.
Digging up USDA Rural
Development loans
To encourage development of rural areas the USDA offers its own
financing through Business and Industry (B&I) loans, discussed inChapter 9, and rural development (RD) loans. As an investor, youdon’t qualify for the RD loans designed for residential homebuyers, but these loans can benefit you indirectly if you buy andsell property in rural areas. Prospective buyers who can’t obtainfinancing elsewhere may qualify for an RD loan.

ment, visit

Avoiding the Prepayment 
Penalty Trap
When a bank loans you money for 30 years, it’s counting on the
fact that you’re going to be paying interest to them for a long time.They have invested a certain amount of time and energy in origi-nating that loan and need time to be able to make a profit off theirinvestment (just like you do). The bank also doesn’t want you refi-nancing with another bank a year or two down the road and cut-ting them out of the deal.
To discourage you from refinancing, and to help keep their initial
costs low, the bank may try to slip a 
prepayment penalty clause into
your mortgage. With this clause, if you refinance and try to pay off
the loan early, you have to pay a stiff penalty — sometimes thou-sands of dollars.
When shopping for mortgages, be sure to ask whether the mortgage
loan has any prepayment penalties and then read the mortgagecarefully before signing it. Prepayment penalties typically apply forup to the first three years of the loan but can extend to longer peri-ods on larger investment properties. If you have to refinance later,you don’t want a prepayment penalty getting in the way.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 9210_422335-ch05.qxp  3/11/09  11:53 AM  Page 92Chapter 6

/H17075Exploring closing costs and how they affect your wallet
/H17075Figuring the bottom line — the total cost of a loan
Whether you’re borrowing money to buy a place to live in or
invest in, you’re not just buying real estate — you’re also
buying money to finance the purchase. You’re a consumer buying aproduct — in this case, a loan program — and you need to comparecosts and benefits just as you do when you make any major purchasing decision.
Your goal is to find a loan that costs you the least amount of money
over the life of the loan and requires monthly payments that youcan afford and that ensure positive cash flows (as discussed inChapter 5). The monthly payment part is fairly easy to figure out —lenders have to tell you what your monthly payments are going tobe upfront. Determining how much it will cost you over the life ofthe loan, however, is a little trickier.
In this chapter, we show you how to shop for loans to find the one
that costs the least and is best suited to your investment goals.
Understanding How This 
Interest Thing Works
Banks and other lenders primarily earn their money by charging
interest on loans — a certain percentage of the principal owed on
the loan ( principal is the amount you owe on the loan). Well, that’s11_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 93certainly easy enough to understand, especially if you’ve pur-
chased any big ticket item like a car or a house on credit.
In practice, however, interest can get pretty complicated. Lenders
may choose to collect interest upfront in points, calculate yourrate as simple interest, amortize the loan, or even play a game of“moving target” by adjusting the interest rate over the life of theloan. In the following sections, we sort out the complexities thatsurround interest rates and explain the essential jargon you’relikely to encounter in plain English.
Keeping simple with simple interest
Simple interest is simple because you can usually calculate the
amount of interest you need to pay in your head or with a very
basic calculator. The formula goes like this:
Principal ×Interest Rate = Annual Interest
You can then calculate your monthly interest by dividing by 12:
Annual Interest ÷ 12 Months Per Year = Monthly Interest
For example, say you borrow $100,000 at 8 percent interest:
$100,000 ×.08 = $8,000 interest per year
$8,000 ÷ 12 = $666.67 interest per month
Because the formulas calculate only the interest owed on the loan,
simple interest is perfect for interest-only loans. (Check out Chapter 5for the ins and outs of interest-only loans.) Unless you’re dealingwith interest-only loans or smaller loans, such as home equity loansor lines of credit, you’re unlikely to encounter simple interest. Mostloans use more complicated methods to calculate interest.
Grasping the concept of amortization
If you ever looked at an amortization table or tried to set up your
own spreadsheet to calculate amortization, you probably ended upbleary-eyed from trying to figure out how anyone could possiblyhave devised such a convoluted system for calculating house pay-ments. 
Amortization is a method for calculating the retirement of
debt that applies significantly higher portions of early payments
toward interest and significantly higher portions of later paymentsto pay down the principal.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 9411_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 94The mathematicians who devised this system had a method to their
madness. They were attempting to create a system to provide forconstant loan payments over a fixed period. The system also had toaccount for interest on the loan and the fact that each paymentreduces the principal owed on the loan, which ultimately results inextinguishing the loan. In other words, they set some lofty goals.
Explaining how amortization works in theory is way too compli-
cated, so consider the following example: Say you owe $100,000 at8 percent interest over a 30-year term. The following steps showyou how to calculate amortization and determine the amount ofinterest due for each payment:
1. Determine the total monthly payment due.
This step is the most mathematically complicated. To figure
your payment, plug the numbers into the following formula:Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 95
AiP i
in
n =××+()
+()−1
11
Ais the total monthly payment, iis the periodic interest
rate, Pis the principal, and nis the number of periods (pay-
ments over the life of the loan). The periodic interest rate is
the annual interest rate divided by 12 months. The number
of periods is the number of years times 12 months.
Using this formula, your monthly payment on a $100,000 at
8 percent interest over a 30-year term comes to $733.76.Yep, this is why everyone uses a loan calculator or a spread-sheet instead of doing the math by hand, but we think youshould know where the numbers are coming from.
2. Calculate how much of the payment is interest by using
the same formula you use to calculate simple interest.
Your payment consists of interest plus a reduction in the
loan balance (principal). Here’s that formula:
Principal ×Interest Rate ÷ 12 = Monthly Interest
So, in this example, your interest on your first payment is
$666.67: $100,000 ×.08 ÷ 12 = $666.67
3. Subtract your interest payment from your total payment
to figure out how much principal you pay off.
Your first monthly payment of $733.76 breaks down like this:
Total payment of $733.76 – $666.67 in interest = $67.09 of
principal.11_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 954. For the next payment, subtract the amount you paid
toward the principal from the total.
$100,000 – $67.09 = $99,932.91, so this figure is the number
you use when you figure your next payment.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 for each subsequent payment.
Based on the calculation in Step 4, the interest portion of
your second payment is $666.22:
$99,932.91 ×.08 ÷ 12 = $666.22
With this payment, $67.54 goes toward principal, and with
each subsequent payment you end up paying more towardthe principal and less toward interest. This pattern continuesuntil the entire balance is paid off in 360 months (30 years).
If you have Microsoft Excel, select File
➪New and check the tem-
plates on your computer to determine whether your version of
Excel comes with an amortization schedule. If it does, you can clickit and click OK to create a new loan amortization schedule. Justplug in the loan amount, term, and interest rate, and Excel does therest. If your version of Excel has no amortization template, you candownload a free one and other real estate finance–related templatesfrom Microsoft’s Office Web site. Go to 
office.microsoft.com ,
click the Templates tab, click in the search box, type “amortiza-
tion,” and press Enter. You have several results to choose from.
Telling the difference between 
the interest rate and APR
Most people know that the interest rate and the annual percentage
rate (APR) differ, but few people understand how they differ. The
interest rate reflects the simple cost of the money you’re borrowing.
The APR is designed to reflect the total cost of the loan, including
any loan origination fees and prepaid costs. As a result, the APR is
higher than the simple interest rate.
Why use an APR? Congress designed the system back in 1974 as a
way to enable consumers to more easily compare the actual costsassociated with the loans. It sort of functions as a consumer pro-tection tool, helping borrowers compare apples to apples in theworld of personal finance.
For example, say you came into my (Chip’s) office and I quoted you
a 30-year mortgage loan for $200,000 at 6.50 percent. You talk toanother loan officer who offers you the same deal at 6.25 percent.On the surface, you think this is a no-brainer — paying one-quarterpercentage point less is going to save you money over the life ofPart II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 9611_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 96the loan. However, what if I’m charging zero points ( points are pre-
paid interest; see “Paying interest upfront with points” later in this
chapter), and this other guy is charging three points (in this case,$6,000)? Now it’s not such a no-brainer.
Which deal is better? All other factors (loan origination fees and
any other costs) being equal, mine is, and you can quickly see bylooking at the APR:
/H12012APR on 30-year fixed mortgage $200,000 at 6.50 percent with
zero points: 6.5 percent.
/H12012APR on a 30-year fixed mortgage $200,000 at 6.25 percent with
three points: 6.626 percent.
What makes my deal even more attractive is that if you were to payoff the loan in less than 30 years (highly common, especially forinvestors), you’d save the $6,000 you would have paid in points tothe other guy.
You can find several APR calculators on the Web by searching for, you
guessed it, “APR calculator.” One of our favorites is at 
mortgages.
interest.com/content/calculators/aprcalc.asp .
Exploring how adjustable 
rate mortgages work
Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) are mortgage loans with interest
rates that can fluctuate (rise or fall). During the mortgage meltdown,
many unsuspecting homeowners got burned by ARMs they probablynever should have been placed into. Although this has given ARMs abad name, they’re actually very useful, particularly for investors, aslong as you use them strategically.
Not all ARMs are created equal, though. Several factors influence
the best-case and worst-case scenarios of how low or high the inter-est rate can go, including the initial interest rate, the 
adjustment
period (how often adjustments can be made), the index (the base
interest rate you pay), the margin (the lender’s markup on the
index), and the cap(the highest rate the lender can charge). We
explain these factors in greater detail in Chapter 5.
For example, say you take out an ARM to purchase a property that
you’re almost certain you can renovate and sell within a year.Taking out an ARM with a rate that stands to rise at the end of oneor two years could be a reasonable gamble. And if you can get theARM for a lower interest rate than the going rate for fixed-ratemortgages, the ARM can actually save you quite a bit of money. Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 9711_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 97Of course, taking out an ARM always carries some risk. Being
“almost certain” you can sell the property within the year for morethan you have in it is no guarantee. Whenever you invest in any-thing, you need to assess the risk/benefit ratio for yourself anddetermine just how much risk you’re willing and able to take on.
Paying interest upfront with points
Plenty of lenders, particularly hard-money lenders, charge interest
upfront in the form of points. (Hard-money lenders are privatelenders; check out Chapter 11 for more on using these types oflenders.) So what are points? One 
point is equivalent to 1 percent
of the total loan amount, so for every $100,000 you borrow, a point
costs you $1,000. A point on a $200,000 loan costs $2,000.
So why do lenders use points? Lenders typically charge points for
one of the following reasons:
/H12012To lower the interest rate: When you choose to pay interest
upfront, the lender may reduce your interest rate, so you pay
less interest with each payment. 
/H12012To get the money upfront: If you pay back the loan quickly, the
lender earns enough for taking the time to process your loan.
When you pay interest upfront to lower the interest rate, you may
not see a net savings for several years. You can calculate the break-even point to determine whether you’ll actually save money bypaying upfront for a lower interest rate. The 
break-even point is the
payment period at which you’ve saved enough money with the
lower interest rate to pay the cost of the points:
1. Start with the cost of the points.
Two points on a $100,000 loan cost $2,000.
2. Determine your monthly savings per payment as a result
of the lower interest rate.
To do this, simply subtract the monthly payment at the
lower interest rate from the monthly payment at the higherrate. In this example, assume you’re saving $50 per month.
3. Divide the cost of the points by the monthly savings.
In this example, you divide $2,000 by $50, which equals 40.
Your break-even point is at 40 months. If you plan on keepingthe property for more than 40 months, you’ll save moneypaying points. If not, it costs you more to pay points.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 9811_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 98Of course, it gets more complicated when you take taxes into con-
sideration, but this gives you a general idea of how points work.
Another reason you may want to pay points is so you can qualify
for a larger loan, because the points you pay lower your monthlypayment. Does paying points make sense? That depends. Crunchthe numbers yourself. For example, a $100,000 loan at 7 percentinterest over 30 years with zero points requires a monthly paymentof $665.30. The same loan at 6 percent with 2 points would cost anextra $2,000 upfront but lower the payment to $599.55 — a monthlysavings of $65.75. At that rate, breaking even on the upfront costwould take just under 31 months, but the investor would likely beable to claim a tax deduction for the costs, depending on his tax sit-uation. In this case, paying points is an okay deal.
Although some people say they never pay points, and others rec-
ommend doing everything you can to lower the interest rate, pointsreally have no 
never or always. Sometimes you have to pay points
to gain access to the cash you need to do the deal, as we explain
in Chapter 5.
Considering the Mortgage Term
When investing in residential real estate and looking for a low-cost
loan, you need to take a close look at the mortgage term. A lenderoften quotes the mortgage 
term in years; for example, you may
have a 15- or 30-year mortgage. However, for payment purposes
you calculate the term on a monthly basis — 12 payment periodsper year over 30 years equals a total of 360 months or paymentperiods. A 15-year mortgage has 180 payment periods.
Understanding the term is important because it ultimately affects
how much money you end up paying for the loan over the life ofthe loan. For your average homeowner, a shorter term can pay div-idends. Pay off a $200,000 loan in 15 years rather than 30, and yousave a whopping $155,437.
However, as an investor, you have a different perspective. Investors
like longer terms because they increase a property’s cash flow, givingthem more cash to do more deals. For example, payments on that 15-year mortgage would cost in excess of $467 more per month. Thatwould significantly reduce monthly profit on any rental property andgive you much less money to work with on other deals. 
Remember:
As an investor, the longer the term, the better.Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 9911_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 99Accounting for Closing Costs
Every major newspaper has a financial section where banks, bro-
kers, and other lending companies post their interest rates andoften the points (prepaid interest) they’re currently charging.Although this financial information gives you a general comparisonof the going rates, it really doesn’t help investors or home buyerscomparison shop. These figures usually don’t mention other costsassociated with the loan, such as the loan origination fee, discountpoints, processing fees, paperwork fees, and junk fees. (For moreabout junk fees, see “Forking over other fees” later in this chapter.)
When comparison shopping for loans, you need to take these fees
into account. In the following sections, we explain the mostcommon closing costs you’re likely to see.
Getting socked with origination fees
The loan origination fee is what the lender or broker charges you
as a service fee for processing your loan. They’re usually calcu-
lated the same way as points are — as a percentage of the totalloan amount and charged as a cost to the borrower. For example, a1 percent loan origination fee is 1 percent of the total loan amount,or $1,000 for every $100,000 you borrow.
Although most lenders charge a maximum of 1 percent, the loan
origination fee is always negotiable. Sometimes, all you need to do isask the loan officer to reduce the fee. In other cases, you may needto mention that Julie Swanson on the other side of town is chargingless. For more tips on negotiating, check out 
Negotiating For
Dummies by Michael C. Donaldson and David Frohnmayer (Wiley).
Although you may not consider the loan origination fee part of the
loan, you should always include it in your calculations of the totalcost of the loan. This strategy enables you to more effectively comparison-shop for the best deal.
Forking over other fees
Points and loan origination fees are only a couple of the legitimate
expenses you can expect to see on a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) orHUD-1 (see the next section). Other legitimate fees include the following:

/H12012Reserves for paying taxes or insurance
/H12012State tax/stamps
/H12012Title insurance
/H12012Underwriting fee (negotiable)
Some lenders include a processing fee, which is fairly standard but
usually negotiable. (This fee covers the time and effort invested in
handling the paperwork, along with any copy or printing costs.)You can usually figure out whether any of these fees is exorbitantby comparing a few Good Faith Estimates from other lenders.
Although we like to think of brokers and bankers as being trust-
worthy professionals, some are less forthright than others and areinfamous for padding their closing fees with what the industrycalls 
junk fees. One time I (Chip) was surprised to find an “e-mail
fee” of $35 tacked onto my closing statement. Upon inquiry, I was
told that this amount was what the title company charged to e-mailthe documents over to the lender. How ridiculous! I was able to getit removed in about 45 seconds. Here are some other morecommon junk fees to watch out for:Chapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 101

Junk fees can also be inflated costs of standard fees. If the going
rate for overnight fees is $75, for example, and one lender tries tocharge you $150, ask why.11_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 101Examining the Good Faith Estimate
By law, your broker or lender is required to provide you with a
detailed breakdown of all the costs associated with the loan (resi-dential, not commercial loans). Lenders typically provide a GoodFaith Estimate prior to processing your residential loan applicationand then a HUD-1 statement at closing detailing the actual finalcosts. (The 
Good Faith Estimate is a list of projected costs to the
borrower, while the HUD-1 breaks down all the actual costs that the
seller and buyer are responsible for paying at closing.)
If the lender doesn’t provide a Good Faith Estimate upfront, ask for
one and make sure it’s legible and understandable. Some lenderslike to use fine print and shading to conceal what they’re reallycharging and then give you a copy of the copy of the copy of thefaxed original to make it completely unreadable.
Costs, particularly the loan origination fee and points, shouldn’t
change dramatically from what’s on the Good Faith Estimate towhat you see on the HUD-1 at closing. If you notice any change,bring it up at the closing table and don’t sign the papers until anyissues are resolved to your satisfaction and in writing. See Chapter 7for more about covering your back at closing.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 102
Are Good Faith Estimates standardized?
When you start shopping for loans, you’re likely to see all sorts of Good Faith
Estimates, each of which categorizes its expenses differently and assigns eachexpense a different name. All these differences can make it difficult, if not impossi-ble, to compare estimated closing costs.
Fortunately, the federal government is stepping up to deal with this issue. On
November 12, 2008, HUD announced several new mortgage rules to help consumersshop for lower-cost home loans. One of the new rules requires that starting onJanuary 1, 2010, lenders use a standardized GFE. The new three-page GFE benefitsborrowers in two ways:
/H12012When all lenders start using the form, the standardized model enables borrow-
ers to compare costs line by line without having to decipher different names forthe same charges.
/H12012The new GFE contains line-item references to the same amounts on the HUD-1,
making it easier to spot any changes between the estimated charges on theGFE and the actual charges on the HUD-1 at closing.11_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 102Calculating a Loan’s Total Cost
Your bank or mortgage broker is likely to lay out a virtual buffet of
loan types for you to choose from: fixed-interest, adjustable ratemortgage (ARM), interest-only, and others. We describe the prosand cons of these loan types in Chapter 5. If you’re still unclearabout the benefits and drawbacks of a particular loan program, askthe bank representative or your mortgage broker lots of questions.
Don’t get too caught up in the various loan types. For people buying
houses they plan to reside in for 30 years, loan type is a big factor.For real estate investors, particularly those who plan to sell theproperty or refinance the loan within a couple of years, the cost ofthe loan over the life of the loan becomes more important. To com-pare loans and find the best bargains, take the following steps:
1. Start with the amount the bank charges you upfront in
loan origination fees, points, and other fees.
When performing these calculations, include all points, but
realize that not all points are created equal. Lenders cancharge 
discount points , defined by some states as the legal
cost associated with reducing the interest rate for a bor-
rower. Lenders can also charge points as a fee (for exam-ple, 
origination points ) that don’t reduce the borrower’s
interest rate.
2. Multiply the monthly payment times the number of
months you plan to pay on the loan.
3. Add the two amounts to determine your total payment.
4. Total the amount of each payment that goes toward
paying the principal of the loan.
Your lender can tell you how much of each payment goes
toward principal.
5. Subtract the total you determined in Step 4 from the total
in Step 3.
The result is the total amount you can expect to pay for the
loan over the life of the loan.
To save yourself some time performing these calculations, checkout the mortgage payment calculator on our Mortgage Myths Website at (
www.themortgagemyths.com ).
Say that you’re considering two loans, each for $100,000. You plan
on using the loan to buy and renovate a home over two years andChapter 6: Bargain Hunting for Low-Cost Loans 10311_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 103then sell it and pay off the remaining principal on the loan. You
have a choice between a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 6 percentor a 30-year, interest-only loan at 5 percent. Look at the 6-percent,fixed-rate mortgage first:
Loan origination fee and discount points: $1,000.00
Monthly payment of $599.55 
×24 months: $14,389.20
Total payments (fees plus monthly payments): $15,389.20
Total paid toward principal: $2,531.75
Total cost of loan (payments minus $12,857.45
principal paid):
Here are the numbers for the 30-year, interest-only loan at 5 percent:
Loan origination fee and discount points: $1,000.00Monthly payment of $416.67 
×24 months: $10,000.08
Total payments: $11,000.08
Total paid toward principal: $0.00
Total cost of loan: $11,000.08
As you can see, even though you’re not paying down the principal
on the interest-only loan, over the life of the loan, you pay about$1,700 less. In addition, the interest-only loan has much lowermonthly payments, freeing up cash to use for renovations andother investments.
As a general rule for 
quick flips (buying and selling a property in
less than a year’s time), opt for loans with low (or no) closing
costs, low (or no) discount points, and low interest rates. Avoidany loans that have early-payment penalties.
Don’t forget to account for cash flow and tax benefits that may be
available. A lender may charge you $3,000 in points, but if you canwrite off a portion of that mortgage interest on your taxes, it mayend up costing you less than $3,000. Also, always remember thathaving access to financing is often more important than the cost ofthat financing. Crunch the numbers to get the lowest-cost loanavailable, but don’t beat yourself up if you have to pay more thanaverage — as long as you can walk away with a decent profit and apositive cash flow.
One more, very important word of caution: Always factor in a
margin of error to account for the unexpected.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 10411_422335-ch06.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 104Chapter 7

/H17075Getting a loan to finance investment-based residential property
Assuming you own the home you live in, you’ve already filled
out at least one loan application and have been through one
closing. Whether you did everything correctly is another question,but at least you have a general sense of how the process works.
As the buyer of a residential property and the borrower, you have
the most papers to sign — papers dealing not only with the prop-erty you’re buying but also with the loan you’re taking out tofinance the purchase. Faced with mountains of documents to sign,borrowers (even seasoned investors) often give the paperwork acursory check at most before signing on the dotted line. This care-lessness can be a big mistake, however, leaving you open to sign-ing up for something you never really agreed to.
In this chapter, we review the closing process in greater detail and
show you how to avoid many of the traps that ensnare even thesavviest real estate investors.
Completing Your Loan Application
Filling out a loan application isn’t exactly rocket science, but it
does call for some careful attention to detail. The applicationrequires specific and accurate financial details that enable your
loan originator (broker or loan officer) and your lender to properly
evaluate your current financial situation and your ability to make
payments and repay the loan. In addition, the lender provides you12_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 105with specific information, by way of lender disclosures, about the
loan program and its costs.
In the following sections, we show you how to complete the loan
application, review the various disclosures, supply the additionaldocumentation your lender needs to process your application, andsign a release of information, so your lender can confirm the infor-mation you supply.
Walking through the parts 
of the loan application
In order to be able to accurately complete the loan application,
you first need a good grasp on what the form comprises.Everything in your loan application package revolves around the
Uniform Residential Loan Application — a five-page, fill-in-the-blank
form that requests all sorts of information about the property
you’re buying and your financial situation. Although your loan orig-inator actually prepares the form for you, go through the processyourself first so that you can gather the necessary informationahead of time and see for yourself what the lender looks at todetermine whether you qualify for the loan.
The Uniform Residential Loan Application is commonly referred to
as the 
FNMA (Fannie Mae) 1003 application or simply the Ten-Oh-
Three. To download the form, visit www.efanniemae.com/sf/
formsdocs/forms/1003.jsp and click the link for the desired 
version — the blank form or an interactive version you can type
your own entries into.
The form consists of ten sections:
/H12012I. Type of Mortgage and Terms of Loan: Basic information
about the loan, including the type (FHA, VA, Conventional,
Rural), total loan amount, interest rate, term (number of
months), and amortization type. Your loan originator can
supply this information. Refer to Chapter 6 for details aboutamortization.
/H12012II. Property Information and Purpose of Loan: Description of
the property (including its location) and how you plan to use
it: as a primary residence, secondary residence, or investmentproperty. This section also covers whether the loan is for newconstruction or refinance, how the title will be held, and thesource of the down payment and any closing costs.
/H12012III. Borrower Information: General information about you,
including your name, address, previous address, SocialPart II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 10612_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 106Security Number, marital status, number of children (if any),
and so on.
/H12012IV. Employment Information: Information about your and any
coborrower’s employment, including names and addresses of
the most recent three employers, dates of employment, andmonthly gross income. The lender wants to know the past twoto five years’ history.
/H12012V. Monthly Income and Combined Housing Expense
Information: Information about monthly income including
base pay, bonuses, overtime, commissions, dividends and
interest, and rental income, along with housing expenses thatinclude any monthly rent, existing home loan payment (princi-pal and interest), property taxes, mortgage insurance, home-owners’ association fees, and so forth.
/H12012VI. Assets and Liabilities: The value of what you own (assets)
and how much you owe (liabilities). Assets include balances
in checking and savings accounts, stocks and bonds, the cur-
rent cash value of any life insurance policies, vested interestin retirement funds, the value of any real estate you own, andso on. Liabilities include any current loans you have, creditcard debt, alimony or child support payments, and job-relatedexpenses (including child care).
/H12012VII. Details of Transaction: Overview of the financial aspects
of this particular loan, itemizing the costs and sources of
financing. Costs include the purchase price, cost of alterationsand improvements, cost of land (if purchased separately), 
refinance costs (debts to be paid off through the refinance),
closing costs, cost of mortgage insurance, and so on. Sources
of financing include the loan itself, closing costs paid for bythe seller (if any), cash from the borrower, and other sources.You may need to consult your loan officer and others involvedin the transaction to gather all the information you need.
/H12012VIII. Declarations: Yes/no questions for you and your co-
borrower (if applicable) to determine whether past or present
situations may affect your ability to make payments and paythe loan. Questions include whether you have any outstand-ing judgments, whether you’ve declared bankruptcy or suffered foreclosure, whether you’re obligated to pay childsupport or alimony, and so on.
/H12012IX. Acknowledgement and Agreement: Here is where you
sign, acknowledging that the information in this loan applica-
tion is correct to the best of your knowledge and that you andany coborrower are knowingly entering into this agreementwith the lender.Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 10712_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 107/H12012X. Information for Government Monitoring Purposes:
Information that enables the government to track statistics on
mortgages and homeownership relating to race and ethnicity.The information also enables the government to enforce anyantidiscrimination rules and regulations.
As an investor, you know that the more prepared you are, the morequickly you get things done. The same is true with financing. Byhaving all the necessary information at your fingertips, you canwork with your lender (or loan officer) to complete your loanapplication in a matter of minutes.
Although you may be tempted to fudge the facts on the Uniform
Residential Loan Application, don’t do it (or allow anyone else todo it for you). Lying on a loan application is all too common, butit’s also a felony. The rules are ultimately meant to protect you. Ifyour net assets are too small to qualify for the loan, for example,then having your application rejected protects you from a poten-tial financial nightmare. See lenders as your partners, not your ene-mies. For more about dodging the real estate and mortgage fraudbullet, turn to Chapter 2 for more info.
Reviewing the lender’s disclosures
In the Declarations section of the 1003 (see the previous section),
you and any coborrower must answer several disclosure questionsas a way of “coming clean” about your current financial situation.Your lender also must commit to a certain level of transparencyregarding its practices and the loan you’re applying for. For example,by law, a lender can’t play some cruel game of bait-and-switch onyou by dangling an attractive set of numbers during the applicationprocess and then sticking you with a real stinker of a loan at closing.
Be sure to examine the lender’s disclosures carefully before signing
on the dotted line, as explained in the following sections. At theclosing, make sure the lender adheres to whatever those disclo-sures stipulate. (For more about closing, skip ahead to the sectionentitled “Navigating the Closing.”)
Program disclosures
Regardless of the loan program, be sure you fully understand the
program disclosures (the terms of the loan agreement) before you
sign anything. If you don’t understand how a particular type of
loan works, keep asking your mortgage expert questions until youfully understand what you’re getting yourself into.
For example, some loan programs are straightforward. If you’re
taking out a 30-year mortgage at 7.5 percent interest, the lenderPart II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 10812_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 108has very little to disclose about the program itself. On the other
hand, more-complicated loan programs may require that thelender provide an additional disclosure. With adjustable rate mort-gage (ARM) programs, for example, the lender must notify you ofthe index it uses, the margin associated with the loan, and how andwhen the lender calculates changes to your interest rate. For moreabout ARMs, including the roles that the index and margin play,check out Chapter 5.
The disclosure may also contain a hypothetical example showing a
brief history of changes and how your rate may have changedunder that program if you had a loan with those terms. (For moreabout ARMs, including the roles that the index and margin play,head to Chapter 5.)
Good Faith Estimate
For all loan types, your lender is required by law to provide you
with a ballpark figure of all the costs associated with this loan inthe form of a 
Good Faith Estimate (or GFE, in industry lingo). The
GFE provides a complete breakdown of all the costs associated
with the loan you’re applying for, including the loan origination fee,appraisal fee, and underwriting fee. Only by comparing GFEs canyou get a good feel of what’s normal and what’s excessive in themarket. Although the lender must supply the GFE to you withinthree days of receiving your application, most lenders offer theGFE prior to the application.
Ask for the GFE in advance, so you don’t waste time applying for a
loan you have no intention of following through on. In fact, obtain aGFE from at least three lenders so you can compare the programsand their costs. Watch for 
junk fees (unfair charges), as discussed
in Chapter 6. If any of the costs on the GFE look out of the ordinary,
ask about it.
Truth In Lending statement
The Truth-In-Lending disclosure (TIL) gives you a reflection of the
true cost of the loan, including the interest rate and fees. In short,
the TIL makes it easier for you to comparison-shop for loans.
One of the key items on the TIL is the annual percentage rate
(APR), as discussed in Chapter 6. The APR shows you how much
interest you’re really paying on a loan if you include the upfront
costs in your calculations. For example, say you’re comparing thefollowing two loans:
/H12012$100,000 30-year fixed rate loan at 7 percent interest with
finance costs of $5,000
/H12012$100,000 30-year fixed rate loan at 8 percent interest with
finance costs of $4,000Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 10912_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 109With numbers like these tossed about, comparison-shopping
becomes almost impossible. At first glance, the second loan mayseem like the better deal, costing $1,000 less upfront, but if youlook at the APR, you get a different picture:
/H12012The first loan has an APR of 7.52 percent and costs you
$251,485 over the life of the loan.
/H12012The second loan has an APR of 8.44 percent and costs you
$274,723 over the life of the loan, or $23,238 more than loan one.
The TIL also discloses any late-payment fees associated with theloan, whether the loan has any early-payment penalties, and theproposed payment schedule. If the loan is an ARM loan, it may illus-trate what will happen to the payments as the rate starts to change.
The TIL is a great tool for taking a quick look at which loan among
several is the best deal, but it doesn’t provide enough informationto evaluate specific costs associated with a particular loan. Use itin tandem with the GFE. 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)
RESPA standardizes closings for residential real estate transactions
in order to clamp down on any funny business that may occur at
closing. According to the act, all closings must use a HUD-1 form todisclose the costs of the loan and show where all the disbursedfunds are going.
Take a copy of your GFE to the closing to compare the fees dis-
closed on it with the fees actually being charged according to theHUD-1. This practice is one of the best ways to catch any discrep-ancies between what your loan originator told you and what it’sactually charging you.
RESPA also controls certain actions of settlement providers such
as the closing agent, and service providers (including the titleinsurance provider, credit company, and appraiser) to preventthem from working together against the best interests of the con-sumer (as in the case of price-gouging or kickbacks). Section 8 ofRESPA has two important components:
/H12012The first part prevents a lender from overcharging for settle-
ment services and keeping the difference. For example, if theappraisal costs $400, the lender can’t charge you $600 andpocket the extra $200.
/H12012The second part prevents lenders and service providers from
accepting or offering kickbacks for referral business — forexample, a lender can’t refer a specific appraiser and thenaccept part of the appraiser’s fee as a reward.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 11012_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 110RESPA’s provisions cover all aspects of services, companies, and
individuals, including title companies, attorneys, and real estateagents.
HOEPA — Section 32
The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) is an
amendment to the Truth In Lending Act (TILA) to protect homeown-
ers from paying excessive fees and interest. HOEPA is part of TILA
but stands alone in its application; Congress passed these two sep-arate acts:
/H12012TILA covers all residential loan transactions (one- to four-
family units), whether they’re owner-occupied or investmentproperties. It doesn’t apply to commercial loan transactions.
/H12012HOEPA, also referred to as “Section 32” or “high-rate, high-fee
loan disclosures,” applies to residential owner-occupieddwellings for purchases and refinances. It includes one- tofour-family owner-occupied properties (which could be amultiunit investment property in which one unit is occupiedby the investor). It also applies to anyone you sell the propertyto. HOEPA doesn’t apply to pure investment properties orcommercial loan transactions, but you should always be awareof it so you know what’s considered fair in terms of fees.
Under this regulation, lenders must warn borrowers if APRs exceed10 percent of the comparable Treasury yield (which meansTreasury securities having a similar period of maturity, such as 30years), or if the deal’s total points and fees exceed 8 percent of theloan amount.
Most lenders don’t offer loans that fall under Section 32, including
to investors, so this regulation usually isn’t an issue. Just be awareof these restrictions and limitations to make sure you’re workingwith a lender who plays by the rules.
Supplying the requested 
documentation
In order to review your loan application, your lender needs some
supporting documentation that verifies the information you sup-plied. Gather the following documents:
/H12012Federal tax returns (with all attachments and schedules) for
the past two years
/H12012W-2s from the past two years
/H1201230-days’ worth of paycheck stubsChapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 11112_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 111/H12012List of real estate owned, complete with income and expenses
/H12012Any and all supporting documentation for assets and liabili-
ties listed on the Uniform Residential Loan Application (bankstatements, credit card statements, divorce decree, retirementearnings statements, and so on)
Make a copy of each document in the list and place them neatly ina folder labeled with your name and contact information. You canthen hand the entire package (the copies, not the originals) over toyour loan originator at your next meeting.
Signing a release of information
Providing your loan originator with a loan application package is
like submitting a resume for a job — it paints a picture of you onpaper, but it may not be an accurate portrait. To make sure theinformation is factual, your loan originator needs to verify it in thereal world, usually by checking independent sources such asemployers, banks, and even providers of government benefits.
Most lenders require that you sign a 
borrow authorization form,
which gives them permission to check your credit and independ-
ently verify any information you provide for this transaction.
Before you sign the release, read it carefully to make sure it covers
only this transaction. You don’t want to give anyone carte blancheto poke around in your financial affairs whenever they want.
Additionally you may be asked to sign an IRS Form 4506 or 8821 for
verifying tax return information. These forms are standard, but makesure you don’t sign blank ones — make the lender fill out the yearscovered, or else it can go get your tax returns from six years ago.
Following the Loan 
Processing Trail
After you supply your prospective lender with a completed loan
application and supporting documentation, all you can really do iswait. During this time, you may be wondering what the lender isdoing, whether you need to be doing something, and how thiswhole loan application process is going to unfold.
To prevent anxiety from overtaking you, the following sections lead
you through the course of a processing and keep you posted onthe possible outcomes.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 11212_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 112Getting up to speed on 
the underwriting process
You may be under the illusion that right now an accountant is comb-
ing through your loan application and supporting documents forproof that you’re worthy of a loan. The fact is that nowadays com-puters actually do the initial screening. The information you provideis entered into an 
automated underwriting (AU) system, which per-
forms a preliminary evaluation and spits out the conditions and doc-
umentation requirements of the loan.
The AU system can’t deny your loan application. It can only place
your application in one of the following three categories:
/H12012Accept/Eligible: This category is the best; it means that
you’re approved for the loan, subject to certain conditions.
Those conditions show up on the findings report and must be
part of the file for final approval. The loan officer or processor
obtains the necessary documents as requested and then sub-mits the complete file to the underwriter to review for accu-racy. The file is already approved at this point, so they’re onlylooking to make sure you’ve submitted and signed each of therequired supporting documents and disclosures.
/H12012Accept/Ineligible: This category indicates that the loan is
approved but is ineligible for purchase in the conforming
market (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac). For example, it may be a
jumbo loan, where the loan amount is outside the upper limit
of what Fannie and Freddie can purchase. Many investors still
use AU systems and approve/buy these loans anyway.
/H12012Refer: This category is also typically known as a dead deal. An
underwriter still has to review the file before it can be denied,
but loan files that fall in this category don’t come with the samelender guarantees against loan losses, so the lender has noincentive to take on the additional risk of approval. Unless theloan can be repackaged and resubmitted to obtain a differentAU result, the deal is likely DOA.
Don’t let a dead deal get you down. Even if you can’t obtain a loanfrom traditional sources, you can usually find other means offinancing your investments, as we explain in Part IV .
Obtaining an appraisal or AVM
One of the first things any lender wants to know is whether the
property you’re buying is worth the money you’re borrowing topay for it. Actually, it wants to make sure the property is worthChapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 11312_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 113more than the money you’re borrowing so that if anything prevents
you from paying back the loan, the lender has something of suffi-cient value to sell and recoup its investment.
To assess the value of a property, the lender orders an appraisal,
an 
Automated Valuation Model (AVM) report, or both and usually
charges you for it as a part of the cost of processing your loan.
This appraisal isn’t something you order — the lender wants to bein charge of picking an objective appraiser.
Expect to pay the full price for an appraisal, even if the property
was recently appraised. Old appraisals can’t be recertified nomatter how recent they may be.
Appraisers generally take one of the following three approaches
when performing an appraisal:
/H12012Sales comparison: This most-common form of appraisal for
residential properties compares the property to similar,
recently sold properties in the same vicinity. The appraisercan then adjust her estimate by accounting for differencesbetween the comparable homes and depreciation.
/H12012Income approach: This method is used for income-producing
properties, such as rental units. The appraiser compares simi-
lar properties in the same market to determine how muchincome the appraised property is likely to generate.
/H12012Cost approach: This method is commonly used to establish
the value of a unique property or properties in areas where
few comparisons are available. The appraiser determines thevalue of the land and 
improvements (the building on the land)
and then subtracts for depreciation.
An appraisal that uses the income approach is likely to cost a little
more than a market-comparison appraisal, but not a whole lotmore. If the lender tries to charge you hundreds of dollars morethan you’d be paying for a standard appraisal (for a typical owner-occupied residential dwelling), find out why.
Having the property inspected
Whenever you make an offer on a property, make the offer contin-
gent upon the property passing inspection, and then have thehome professionally inspected. (This action is more for your pro-tection than the lender’s. Lenders usually don’t require an inspec-tion, even on government-secured loans.) This contingencyPart II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 11412_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 114ensures that you don’t get stuck holding the bag on any of the 
following big-ticket items:
/H12012Damaged foundation or other structural anomalies
/H12012Electrical wiring problems
/H12012Broken sewer lines, poor plumbing, or aging septic systems,
especially if the house has been vacant for some time
/H12012Leaking, nonfunctioning, or nonexistent gas lines
/H12012Poorly functioning furnace or central air conditioning units
/H12012Leaking or ramshackle roof
/H12012Termite damage
/H12012Health hazards such as lead-based paint, toxic mold, radon
gas, asbestos, and hazardous insulation
In the following sections, we show you how to track down a profes-sional home inspector and ensure that you obtain a thoroughinspection.
Hiring a qualified home inspector
If you decide to hire an inspector, you can crack open the phone
book and find listings for dozens of home inspectors in just aboutany area of the country. Finding a qualified home inspector, how-ever, is a challenge. So where do you start? Ask the following indi-viduals for referrals:
/H12012Your real estate agent or other real estate professionals you
know: By networking with homeowners, investors, and col-
leagues, real estate professionals know the best service
providers in the area. Ask them for references to the bestinspectors. If one inspector’s name pops up on several lists,you’ve probably found a winner.
/H12012The National Association of Certified Home Inspectors
(NACHI) Web site: NACHI is a nonprofit agency that works
toward educating and ensuring the quality of home inspec-
tors. Its Web site at www.nachi.org features an online referral
service that you can search to find certified home inspectors
in your area. Make sure the inspector you hire is NACHI-certified — meaning the member has performed at least 250inspections and passed two written proficiency exams.
/H12012Friends, family members, and colleagues: Gather referrals
from people you know and trust. Using an inspector who’s done
a satisfactory job for someone you know usually delivers betterresults than choosing someone blindly.Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 11512_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 115/H12012Your town’s building inspection department: Most towns have
building inspectors who examine buildings as they’re being
constructed or renovated to ensure that they adhere to thelocal building codes. In some cases, you can hire the town’sbuilding inspectors to perform your inspection for you. Theytend to be more thorough, and they’re well versed on localbuilding codes. The inspectors often show up as a team thattypically includes a plumber, an electrician, a heating and airconditioning specialist, a builder, and someone who specializesin zoning. You get a thorough inspection and a complete write-up for about the same price as you’d pay a private inspector.
/H12012Better Business Bureau (BBB): Although the BBB has a policy
of not recommending certain businesses, it does offer a tool
that enables you to search for BBB-certified businesses inyour area. Start your search at 
welcome.bbb.org , where you
can enter your ZIP code to skip to the Web site for the nearest
BBB. You can then click the Find an Accredited BBB Businessto start your search.
When you have a few leads, contact your candidates and ask themthe following questions:
/H12012Are you certified, licensed, and insured? Certification and
licensing ensure that the inspector has the basic qualifica-
tions for the job. Insurance covers any serious defects he mayoverlook.
/H12012How long have you been a home inspector? Length of serv-
ice is often, but not always, a good indication of experience
and expertise. Someone who’s been in the business for 10years probably has more experience than a person who’s justgetting started.
/H12012How many homes have you inspected? “One or two” isn’t the
answer you’re looking for. A busy home inspector is usually
busy because she’s good.
/H12012What did you do before becoming a home inspector?
Someone who’s a retired carpenter or home builder is proba-
bly a better candidate than, say, a burned-out English teacher.
/H12012Do you have references I can call? If the inspector has a
good track record, people don’t hesitate to provide positive
references.
/H12012Do you recommend remedies or simply identify problems?
Look for an inspector who’s had experience in construction.
Someone who not only points out problems but also recom-mends repairs and renovations is a good choice.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 11612_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 116/H12012How much do you charge? Most inspectors charge a flat fee
of a few hundred bucks — more or less depending on the size
of the home and the complexity of the inspection. As youinterview candidates, you can get a pretty good idea of thegoing rate for a typical home inspection in your area.
After you gather answers and information from all your candidates,make a decision. Sit down with your list and identify the inspectorwho has the best experience and credentials of the bunch butdoesn’t charge an exorbitant fee.
Attending the inspection
Although attendance isn’t mandatory, you should show up for the
inspection prepared to take notes. Your notes should include thefollowing:
/H12012Possible structural defects: The inspector will point out
cracked foundation walls, weak roof trusses, or shifting foot-
ings or joists. These problems can be extremely costly andcan kill a deal quickly.
/H12012List of functional defects: Examples include a furnace that no
longer functions or is leaking carbon monoxide, or a toilet that
doesn’t flush. These are critical repairs that have the mostimpact on your ability to resell the property or lease it out.
/H12012List of potential environmental problems: An example
includes insulation that contains asbestos or ground on the
lot that’s been contaminated by a local industrial plant. Thesecan be costly to fix.
/H12012List of cosmetic defects: These include divots or dents in the
walls, peeling paint, and other defects that just look bad.
They’re less-serious stuff.
/H12012Anything else the inspector points out: These may range
from minor issues, such as a leaky faucet, to more major
issues, such as a stained ceiling that may be a sign of some-thing more serious, but the inspector can’t gain access to thearea above the ceiling to check it out. 
If you’re note-taking challenged, consider carrying a digital recorderwith you during the inspection. Just don’t forget to turn it on.
Requesting repairs
With your list of property defects in hand, highlight the ones you
expect the seller to repair and then have your agent present thelist to the seller or seller’s agent. The seller agrees to make allrepairs, refuses to make all repairs, or agrees to make only some ofChapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 11712_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 117the repairs. It’s up to you to decide whether you want to move for-
ward with the deal.
For any repairs you’re willing to take on and other renovations to
improve the property, obtain estimates from independent contrac-tors to determine approximate costs. Get three bids from licensedprofessionals, including the time estimated to complete the work,as well as the lead time needed to schedule the work.
Don’t get your inspector involved in providing estimates or doing
any repairs or renovations to a property. This creates a conflict ofinterest, which is prohibited on government-insured loans.
For additional details on how to determine whether a property is
likely to be a profitable investment, check out Ralph and Joe’s
Flipping Houses For Dummies (Wiley) and Real Estate Investing For
Dummies, 2nd edition, by Eric Tyson and Robert S. Griswold (Wiley).
When you’re estimating the costs of repairs and renovations, keep
in mind that as soon as you take possession of the property (atclosing), you’re responsible for the holding costs on the propertywhen repairs are being done. (
Holding costs are the expenses you
incur when the property is just sitting there — they include the
monthly mortgage payments, insurance, property taxes, and utili-ties.) By planning your repairs and renovations prior to closingand lining up contractors to begin work as soon as possible afterclosing, you can slash your holding costs.
Testing the water
You may not need to test the water as a condition for obtaining
loan approval, but if the system is served by a well, get the watertested for your own protection. Your county health department oran independent lab can perform the required tests, but you needto collect the water:
1. Get a clean bottle from the lab or your county health
department.
2. Go to the water faucet farthest from the well source.
3. Let the water run for at least five minutes.4. Fill the bottle and label it as instructed.5. Have the sample tested right away.
The lab usually returns the results within a couple of days and
lets you know the chemical makeup, including minerals and any detectable E. coli in the water.
If the property is serviced by a community well, request maintenance records.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 11812_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 118I, Chip, usually steer clear of properties serviced by community
wells. I also avoid properties on which the well is located in acrawl space or basement. These pose financing risks, and anyeventual buyer will be limited in financing options.
Having the septic system inspected
If the property relies on a septic system, have a qualified septic
contractor inspect the field, saturation levels, and estimatedremaining life of the system. These systems can be very costly toreplace.
Also, research the pumping records with the owner and the county
(usually the county health department), and check with the countyon the age of the system and its maintenance history. The countyshould have records of when the system was installed and a pumpcard that shows when it was last pumped out.
If the system is more than 10 years old, we highly recommend that
you have a qualified professional perform a 
perk test . This test
makes sure the septic field is draining properly and isn’t saturated
(a situation that indicates a short remaining life).
Obtaining a survey
Your lender will request a survey on the property, regardless of the
size of the parcel, even if it’s a platted lot (a lot with boundaries
shown on a map). To insure the transaction, the title company
requires a survey or certification of an existing survey. Surveyscome in two types:
/H12012Boundary survey: This type illustrates where the property
lines are and is usually sufficient for a platted lot, because the
parcel’s boundaries have already been recorded.
/H12012Stake survey: With this type the surveyor actually goes out
and places or finds metal boundary stakes to certify the
actual boundary lines of the parcel. The stake survey isslightly more expensive, but it’s the better choice for water-front property, irregular parcels, and properties with a 
metes-
and-bounds description (commonly found in a deed).
Walk the property with the owner to be sure you know where the
boundary lines are, and ask questions about any easements orencroachments that may exist. If the owner/seller has a copy of theprevious survey, obtain a copy so the surveyor can recertify itinstead of performing a new survey — you may save a few bucks.Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 11912_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 119Navigating the Closing
Although the closing (or settlement) is the final step in the real
estate transaction, it can feel a little anticlimactic. You and theother participants in the transaction have completed your work.Now you’re simply meeting to sign off on the deal you’ve all agreedto and shuffle the money around to the appropriate recipients.
Even though the process may seem like an afterthought on a long
journey, you really need to stay on your toes to avoid any last-minute mishaps. In the following sections, we show you how toensure that the closing proceeds smoothly without any glitchesthat can negatively affect your bottom line.
Keeping your attorney in the loop
A good real estate attorney can keep you from spending thousands
of dollars later to clean up a mess that you can easily avoid now.Get your attorney involved sooner rather than later in the following ways:
/H12012Make sure your attorney reviews the purchase agreement
before you make an offer. Consider working with your attor-
ney to develop a boilerplate purchase agreement you can use
for all of your transactions, so your attorney doesn’t have toreview it every time.
/H12012Have your attorney present during any sensitive or unusual
negotiations. If you’re not completely comfortable with some-
thing the seller or seller’s representative is saying, consult
your attorney before giving a final response. Backing awayfrom something you agreed to, even verbally, can make yourattorney’s job more difficult later.
/H12012Ask your attorney to review the closing papers prior to the
closing date. Have the company handling the closing supply
you with copies at least three days in advance.
Get your attorney involved early. She probably won’t be able to
help you after the closing; even if she can, it’ll cost you a whole lotmore than if you had corrected the errors 
before you signed the
papers.
Dealing with the preliminaries
Closings usually proceed smoothly as long as you have all the
parts in place prior to closing. In the following sections, we showyou how to prepare for your next closing.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 12012_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 120Hiring a title company
Closing is pretty easy, at least from your perspective. In most
cases, your agent or the seller’s agent selects a title company, andthe title company does the rest — gathering all the essential paper-work, making sure everyone shows up to the closing on time, andthen routing the closing documents around the table to make sureeverything gets signed.
The title company also provides title insurance — your only pro-
tection from future claims against the property, including old co-owners, 
lien holders (other parties that claim rights to the
property), backside deals (private negotiated or unrecorded agree-
ments) with neighbors, and a whole host of other potential prob-
lems. Approximately a month after closing, the title companysends you a complete policy. Store it in a safe place — in additionto providing you with a record that you have title insurance, thepolicy can earn you credit toward the next policy when you sell orrefinance the property.
Never ever purchase a property without title insurance. Without
title insurance, you can lose your entire investment overnight. Oneway this can and has happened is when a scam artist sells a prop-erty he doesn’t own. The con artist waits until the owners are onan extended vacation and uses a phony deed to transfer the prop-erty into his own name. He then lists and sells the property andtakes off with the cash. If you happen to have bought the place,and you don’t have title insurance, when the rightful owners returnfrom vacation, you lose the property, but you still owe on that loanyou took out to buy it.
Under RESPA (Section 9), you as purchaser have the exclusive
right to select the title insurance provider. We encourage you to gowith one of the national agencies or one of their agents — someonewith a solid reputation in the marketplace. In addition, larger com-panies have several offices, making dealings more convenientwhen closing time arrives.
Request an 
insured closing letter , indicating that the title company
is insured for handling the transaction. This document provides
you with the assurance that if the closing company mishandlesanything, you don’t get stuck with a bill for its mistake.
The title company disburses funds on investment properties imme-
diately upon the close of the transaction. Request a copy of eachdisbursement check for your records.Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 12112_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 121Reviewing the documents in advance
You have the right to review any closing documents at least 24
hours prior to closing (preferably three days before closing, soyour attorney has time to review them, too). As soon as you’vechosen a title company, contact the company and let your repre-sentative know that you want a copy of the closing packet as soonas possible so you have time to review the paperwork.
Check the mortgage, deed, note, HUD-1 closing statement, and all
other documents for spelling or calculation errors, and make surethe figures on the HUD-1 match up with those on the Good FaithEstimate. If anything looks odd, call the title company and haveyour issues addressed 
before closing. 
Insuring the property
Several days prior to closing, meet with your insurance provider
and review coverage options for the property you’re about to pur-chase. Let your agent know the closing date so he can prepare apolicy for you in advance of the closing.
Make sure you obtain a 
policy and not just an insurance binder (a
promise to insure) — some lenders don’t accept binders.
Signing the documents
Be prepared to sign a lot of documents during closing (and no, you
can’t use a rubber stamp!) You have to provide a picture ID (suchas a driver’s license). The closing agent witnesses and notarizesyour signature many times during the closing.
Request a complete copy set of all 
signed documents (not just
blank ones) and keep them in a safe place just in case you need
them in the future. In the court of real estate law, only signed docu-ments count, so be sure you get a copy of the signed documentsshowing what you and the seller agreed to.
Knowing your right of rescission . . .
or lack thereof
The right of rescission is a federal law that gives you three days to
change your mind on financial deals. It protects consumers from
high-pressure sales tactics. Commonly called the “cooling-off law,”it also allows you to back out of refinance deals on owner-occupiedresidences.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 12212_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 122As an investor, don’t count on the right of rescission to protect
you. It doesn’t apply to the purchase agreement — after you signthe agreement, your offer is binding. In addition, the right appliesonly to owner-occupied residences, not investment properties.
Dealing with surprises
The key to dealing effectively with surprises at closing is to not
have any surprises. In the following sections, you discover someprevention maneuvers that ensure a smooth closing.
Rate changes
Your interest-rate lock agreement is only as good as the loan offi-
cer who gave it to you. You have nothing in writing to say that theperson actually locked in the rate with an investor or that theterms of your application didn’t change just enough to allow (orrequire) the loan officer to place it with a different lender-investoror a completely different loan program.
At least two days prior to closing, confirm your interest rate and
program with the loan officer. If you had been floating the interestrate, he will require you to lock it in at least three days prior toclose so that he can prepare the documents. If it’s not what youagreed upon, hold out until you’re satisfied with the rate andterms. You won’t be able to change them after the closing.
Term changes
Confirm the terms of your loan (including index, margin, and start
rate for an ARM loan) prior to the closing. Your loan terms shouldremain fixed unless something major occurred between the time ofyour application and the closing, but ask anyway. You don’t wantany surprises.Chapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 123
Dodging disaster
How would you like to purchase a property and have it burn down the next day with-
out having insurance to cover it? I, Chip, almost had that happen to me. However,the property actually burned down a day 
before closing. Fortunately, the previous
owners hadn’t cancelled their policy prior to close, or it would have been a real
mess. We had to wait for the property to be rebuilt before we could close on thetransaction — a delay of five months!
The moral of this story: Obtain an insurance policy before closing. Don’t leave the
property uninsured for even one minute — too many things can happen.12_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 123If rates improved since you obtained loan approval, or the prop-
erty numbers no longer meet your expectations, you may considerchanging loan programs in order to maximize your cash flow. Justremember that any changes you make now cancel out the rate andterms you locked in. Even a slight change can jeopardize your lock,giving the lender an opportunity to charge extra fees and interest,so be careful.
Other unexpected events
Once in awhile, other events throw a wrench into the proceedings —
and they’re completely beyond your control. The seller may have achange of heart, the title company may require additional docu-mentation to insure the title transfer, you may have to get lienwaivers, and so on. Take it all in stride — and prepare for a delay.We’ve had lots of closings slightly postponed while someone fixeda glitch, so keep your schedule (and that of your contractors) alittle loose.
You’re dealing with professionals, and they’re programmed to get
any problems resolved as quickly as possible. If anything soundstoo strange or flat-out made up, simply ask your attorney to callthe title company or closing agent. That usually gets the processback on track pretty quickly!
Financing Other Types of
Residential Properties
Most of the information in this chapter relates to financing the pur-
chase of primary residences. Variations arise, however, whenyou’re financing the purchase of other types of properties, includ-ing vacation and investment properties and vacant land. The fol-lowing sections introduce the variables you can expect and showyou how to deal with them.
Digging up money for 
vacation properties
If you’re in the market for a vacation property or second home,
expect the financing requirements to be a lot tighter, the interest rateand costs to be higher, and the down-payment requirements to begreater, with many lenders requiring at least 20 to 25 percent down.Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 12412_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 124Due to the higher costs, you may want to consider purchasing a
fractional ownership, in which you share the property with several
parties. This can be a great way to invest in higher-end properties
located in expensive markets. You can usually find a loan officerwho specializes in these types of loans.
Banks and other more traditional lenders rarely handle loans for
fractional ownerships, so you have to go through a specializedgroup of finance companies. Shop around carefully for one thatspecializes in this type of financing, and make sure that you have asolid agreement with the other parties involved. Make absolutelysure that your real estate attorney reviews all the paperwork andthat you fully understand what you’re getting yourself into.
A management company often makes all the arrangements, but
make sure you understand your obligations as an owner and howthe parties plan to share the income and expenses of the rentals orthe burden of expenses when the rentals are vacant? For moreinformation, check out 
Second Homes For Dummies by Bridget
McCrea and Stephen Spignesi (Wiley).
Financing investment properties
Lenders approach the financing of residential investment properties
(dwellings you rent out) more carefully than they do financing the
purchase of primary residences. As a result, you need to adjustyour expectations and approach to financing these properties in adifferent way as well. We cover the main differences that comewith these properties in the following sections.
Options for financing residential investment properties are some-
what limited. Expect interest rates, costs, and the down-paymentrequirements to all be higher. Often, lenders require a minimum of25 percent down.
Shop around for a lender that offers several options for investment
properties, and be careful of extra fees. You should have to payonly an additional 1.5 to 2 points above a normal owner-occupiedtransaction. Check out Chapter 4 to find out how to shop aroundfor lenders.
Before approving a loan for any income-producing property, your
lender wants to know whether it promises a positive cash flow. Ofcourse, you want to know this, too, so before you even submit anoffer, perform a complete cash flow analysis of the property, asexplained in Chapter 3. Do the math before you do the deal, and ifthe return on your investment is less than you’d earn by investingChapter 7: Navigating the Loan Application and Processing 12512_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 125the money in a CD, we recommend sticking your money in a CD
instead.
Purchasing vacant land
You may be considering buying some vacant land, but before you
purchase any land, remember this point: Only purchase land if youintend to use it for a specific purpose — not as strictly an invest-ment in and of itself.
The saying goes that land is such a great investment because
“they’re not making any more of it.” Truth be told, land is rarelysuch a grand investment for two good reasons:
/H12012It’s tough to finance. Even if you find a lender willing to
finance the purchase, they usually require a high loan-to-
value, (L TV, as discussed in Chapter 3), which means you’relocking up a lot of your investment capital in a down payment.(Most land sales involve owner financing over a period oftime, with flexible terms and conditions.)
/H12012It has a long holding period. Land isn’t a liquid asset. You
usually have to hold onto it for quite a long time before you
realize your gains. Again, your investment capital is locked upin something that’s not producing any cash flow.
Two exceptions do exist to our recommendation: Land is a goodinvestment when
/H12012You know that the land is very likely to be rezoned, causing its
value to increase significantly
/H12012You intend to put it to personal use in construction, parking,
lease, and so on. Part II: Financing the Purchase of Residential Properties 12612_422335-ch07.qxp  3/11/09  11:51 AM  Page 126Part III

/H17075Investing in office space
/H17075Examining retail rental properties
/H17075Investing in motels, hotels, and B and Bs
/H17075Mixing it up with multiuse properties
/H17075Exploring more unique opportunities
One of the easiest ways for a novice to get started in real estate
investing is through the process of flipping a single-family
dwelling. You buy a home below market value, fix it up to market stan-
dards, and sell it at or near its true market value. ( Flipping Houses For
Dummies shows you how.) You already own a house (or you should
before you start buying and selling investment properties), and you
may have already sold one or two, so flipping allows you to use theknowledge you’ve already gained to develop new skills.
Investing in single-family dwellings, however, is only one option.
Other options include multifamily dwellings, office space, stripmalls, hotels, motels, gas stations, and a host of other propertiesthat your average buy-and-sell house flipper never considers.These commercial properties are more conducive to a buy-and-hold strategy, because they offer the potential for generating asteady stream of income.
In this chapter, we address important calculations you need to
make when considering investing in any commercial property,reveal the various types of commercial properties you may want toinvest in, and provide you with the guidance you need to chooseopportunities that are most suitable for your investment goals.14_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 129Estimating the Income Potential 
of a Commercial Property
Evaluating the income potential of prospective commercial proper-
ties isn’t rocket science, but it does require that you perform somebasic arithmetic — subtracting expenses from income to deter-mine cash flow. By performing these calculations, you can come upwith your own ballpark estimates of how potentially profitable anycommercial property will be.
In the following sections, we itemize the income and expense cate-
gories so you can begin collecting the numbers you need anddoing the math. (These calculations work for every type of com-mercial property we cover in this chapter, although the specificincome and expense categories may vary.)
Calculating effective gross income
(EGI)
Whatever scenario you use for your commercial rentals and what-
ever your sources of revenue, the formulas follow the same pat-tern. First, calculate your 
effective gross income (EGI) — all the
revenue you can reasonably expect the property to pull in. With an
estimated EGI in hand, you can then move on to other calculationsthat reveal the property’s profit potential. To calculate the EGI, youneed the following numbers:
/H12012Annual rental income: Multiply the net rentable square feet
by the annual lease income per square foot; for example, 3,000
net rentable square feet ×$17 per square foot = $51,000 per year.
Don’t confuse gross square footage with net square footage —
you can’t charge anyone for space in a telephone room.
/H12012Vacancy: Most lenders use a vacancy factor (to allow for the
amount of time the property sits vacant) in the 5 to 7 percent
range for retail properties. If you expect a higher vacancy ratefor this property, use that number (but don’t go lower than 5 percent).
/H12012Triple Net (or NNN): Income collected from tenants to pay for
taxes, insurance, and maintenance, including common area
maintenance (CAM) charges for shared-use spaces, such aswalkways and public restrooms. Although this is an expenseto you, you also treat it as income because your tenants reim-burse you. Say the tenant occupies 7 percent of the buildingand total expenses are $55,000. To calculate the tenant’s sharePart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 13014_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 130on a monthly basis, multiply the NNN by .07 and divide by 12
months. That would come to about $321 per month.
/H12012Other income: This amount includes money you collect from
tenants for shared secretarial services, storage facilities, ship-
ping or loading dock usage, high-speed Internet or satelliteservices, conference room rental, building signage rights, andso on.
When you have these numbers, you’re ready to do the math to cal-culate your EGI:
Annual Rental Income + NNN + Other Income = Total Income
Total Income – (Total Income 
×Vacancy Factor) = Effective
Gross Income
For example, say you have a small office complex that’s pulling in
$50,000 in rental income per year. It has a cellphone tower thatpulls in another $10,000 per year and a storage facility thataccounts for about $5,000 in income. Plus, the tenants collectivelychip in $15,000 to cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Rarely,if ever, is one of the offices vacant, so you estimate the vacancyfactor at a low 5 percent. The calculation goes like this:
$50,000 + $10,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 = $80,000
$80,000 – ($80,000 
×.05) = $76,000
Thus, your EGI for this property is $76,000.
Calculating Net Operating Income
(NOI)
After you calculate your estimated EGI, you can use that number to
calculate your Net Operating Income (NOI) — your annual income
from the property prior to considering the debt service (the princi-
pal and interest costs on the proposed loan). Before you can pro-
ceed, you need the following numbers:
/H12012Operating expenses (OE): Operating expenses include taxes,
insurance, trash removal, maintenance, payroll, and so on.
/H12012Management expenses (ME): Management expenses include
whatever you pay yourself or others to manage the property.
Remember, even if you manage the property, your time isworth money.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commercial Property Type for You 13114_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 131/H12012Tenant improvements (TI): Calculated on a per-square-foot
basis, these are costs to help renovate the space for the
tenant’s desired use. If the space was previously used by adentist, for example, and now you need to convert it into abookstore, you have some work to do. TI covers new carpet-ing, the relocation of walls, the proper replacement of electri-cal outlets and lights, and so on.
/H12012Leasing concessions (LC): Leasing concessions (such as offer-
ing one month’s free rent) are sometimes necessary to attract
quality long-term tenants. You may also make concessions forless-desirable situations like construction periods (of commonareas) and location differentials (the tenant at the end of thehallway doesn’t get as good exposure as the guy in the middleof the action).
/H12012Credit losses (CL): Unfortunately, not everyone pays their
rent like they’re supposed to. To account for uncollectible
lease payments, budget for credit losses on a yearly basis.
When you have the required numbers, plug them into the followingequation to calculate your NOI:
EGI – OE – ME – TI – LC – CL = NOI
For example, suppose a property has an EGI of $76,000, as calculatedin the example in the previous section. Operating expenses come toabout $20,000. You pay yourself $4,000 per year to manage the prop-erty and pay an assistant $1,500 to keep the records (for a total of$5,500 in management expenses). You’re going to have to spend$7,000 in tenant improvements to transform a corner office into asmall coffee shop for a vendor who’s moving in. To encourage some-one to move into the less-glamorous office space, you offer a leaseconcession of $2,500. And you estimate from the previous owner’srecords that your tenants are going to stiff you about 5 percent onthe rent that’s due. Here’s how the calculation would unfold:
$76,000 – $20,000 – $5,500 – $7,000 – $2,500 – ($76,000 
×.05) = $37,200
Your NOI on this property comes out to $37,200.
Estimating the property’s true value
If you’re wondering whether a particular retail space is worth the
asking price, you can calculate that for yourself by using the NOIand 
local cap rate (market return based on risk). Cap rate is short
for capitalization rate, which is a reflection of the rate of returnPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 13214_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 132that’s considered reasonable for a certain type of commercial
property in a given area based upon its risk.
You can get the local cap rate from a commercial appraiser. Divide
the NOI by the cap rate to estimate the value of the retail center:
NOI ÷ Cap Rate = Estimated Value
If the NOI is $213,000, for example, and the local cap rate is 7 per-cent, your estimated value is about $3,042,900 ($213,000 ÷ .07)!
The NOI and estimated value of the property are the only two num-
bers that matter to the lender — and the only two numbers thatshould matter to you, as well.
Projecting future profits 
with a pro forma
Whenever you meet with prospective lenders to discuss financing
for a commercial venture, the lenders often want you to fire upyour crystal ball and reveal the future possibilities — especiallywhen you have solid plans in place to build a rosy future. You canpresent your vision for the property’s future through a 
pro forma —
a document that projects the future earnings of a property after
you’re able to implement your plans for it. The pro forma assuresthe lender that you’ve analyzed the numbers and have realisticexpectations for the property’s performance.
When you first purchase a property, complete a construction project,
or finish a major rehabilitation, that property may not immediatelygenerate enough income to make it profitable. A new office building,for example, doesn’t have 100-percent occupancy in the first sixmonths! Over the course of a year or two, however, that same prop-erty may become very profitable. A pro forma shows just how prof-itable the property is likely to be.
To create a pro forma, start with the current numbers you calcu-
lated in the previous sections and then project the income/expenses based upon your reasonable assumptions (which youmust substantiate).
For example, if you show the building with pre-leases of 50 percent
initial occupancy and a projected growth of 20 percent per year,your pro forma looks like the one shown in Table 8-1.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 13314_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 133Table 8-1 Sample Pro Forma Figures
Year Income (NOI) Expenses (TOE) DSCR
1 $42,000 $41,350 1.02
2 $58,800 $53,220 1.11
3 $75,600 $61,780 1.22
Although this example is very simplified, it shows the lender what
your projected growth rate of the property is and how it will affectthe loan performance. Be prepared to break out all expenses andsupply real market data (including competing properties in thearea) to back up your assumptions.
Most pro forma projections should extend out two to three years —
five years for major new construction projects. Anything longer thanthat, though, is pure speculation.
Don’t place blind trust in pro formas that other people present to you.
Sometimes, a seller may present you with a pro forma, for example, tosell you on the potential of a property. Disreputable mortgage brokersmay also exaggerate the numbers in a pro forma to convince you tomove forward on a deal. Do your own projections.
Dwelling On the Thought 
of Multifamily Homes
People always need a place to live and don’t always have the
resources or desire to buy their own single-family home. As aresult, multifamily property investments have always been and willalways be a good long-term investment — assuming, of course, youpick winners and structure the deals to work well for you.
Before seizing these potentially lucrative opportunities, however,
develop an understanding of what comprises a multifamilydwelling. Technically speaking, a 
multifamily dwelling is any piece
of real estate that can legally house two or more families. But in
financial circles, these properties fall into two categories:
/H12012Residential: Two- to four-family units classify as residential
properties, which qualifies them for residential financing. If
you plan on living in one of the units, you can usually qualifyfor even more attractive loans available for owner-occupiedproperties.Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 13414_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 134/H12012Commercial: The rules of the game change with any multifam-
ily home over four units — you enter the world of commercial
finance, where the lenders, terms, loan programs, qualifica-tions, and documentation requirements are all different.(Properties with between 5 and about 20 units are considered
garden apartments . More than 20 units constitute large multi-
family units. )
The financing differences between these two categories are monu-
mental, as we explain in the following sections.
Two- to four-family homes
Two- to four-family homes — called duplexes, triplexes, orquads —
are by far the best investment opportunities in the marketplace for
beginning investors. Nowadays, you can find plenty of these prop-
erties on the market due to the foreclosure crisis — just make sureto analyze the numbers carefully to account for all expenses andmaintenance. (See “Crunching the numbers” later in this chapter.)
These properties are also relatively easy to finance — especially if
they’re owner-occupied investment properties. (If you live in oneof the units, it’s considered owner-occupied.)
To qualify for a loan to finance the purchase of a multifamily prop-
erty, owner-occupied or not, you need strong credit and severalmonths of reserves to cover expenses in the event that you’reunable to rent out one or more units.
Securing financing for owner-occupied properties
As discussed in Chapter 4, owner-occupied properties more easily
qualify for government financing, as long as you meet the followingconditions:
/H12012Use at least one of the units as your primary residence for the
next 12 months.
/H12012Make as little as a 3.5 percent down payment (FHA).
/H12012Ensure that the property is self-sufficient; that is, the rental
income must cover the monthly payments and other costs,
including insurance, property taxes, landlord-paid utilities,and maintenance.
/H12012Present documentation that shows you have at least three
months of payment reserves.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 13514_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 135For multifamily properties, qualifying for the loan depends much
more on the revenue-generating potential of the property thanyour job-related income to ensure that you can afford the payments.
Even with government-secured financing, you can expect to pay
more in costs and interest. The appraisal, for example, is likely tocost about twice as much — to cover the time and effort to com-plete an income-approach analysis on the property.
Securing financing for non-owner-occupied properties
The main difference between financing the purchase of an owner-
occupied property and one that’s non-owner-occupied (a property
you don’t plan to live in for at least 12 months) is the down pay-
ment. You can expect lenders to require a down payment of awhopping 25 percent, and you still need to prove that you havethree months’ worth of reserves to cover expenses.
The good news is that you can own the property solely as a 
landlord — you don’t have to live in it.
Garden apartments
Properties that contain between 5 and about 20 individual units
typically fall into the category of garden apartments — an in-
between range that lenders love to finance (and in which the num-
bers often work very well for investors).
The only drawback here is that with garden apartments, you begin
to get into the category of commercial properties, where you nolonger qualify for the most attractive government-secured loans.You don’t get any special breaks if you live in one of the units,either, except for the fact that you don’t have to charge yourselfrent. Fortunately, more lenders are willing to finance these types ofproperties than are willing to finance large multifamily properties.
Large multifamily properties
Large multifamily properties are, well, large. They’re complicated
undertakings. They can also be quite challenging and fun as longas you’ve mastered the art of small- and mid-sized multifamilyproperties first.
In terms of financing these behemoths of residential real estate,
you’re working smack dab in the middle of the commercial arenawhere everything becomes a numbers game. Plus, fewer lendersare available, and professional on-site management becomes amust. Track down a mortgage broker who specializes in financingcommercial properties.Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 13614_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 136Lenders don’t want to deal with inexperienced landlords, so wade
in slowly. Start with two- to four-family units and work your way upto a garden apartment complex before you attempt a large multi-family property. Otherwise, you’re just wasting everyone’s time.After you’ve gained some experience, you’re ready to move up andgain some additional leverage.
When you’re evaluating the profit potential of large multifamily
properties, the main difference is that you have more expenses toaccount for, such as payroll for maintenance or office personnel,snowplowing trucks, parking lot striping, pool maintenance, andother items.
Property management is one expense that’s a sure thing. Figure
this expense at 5 to 7 percent of the property’s gross potentialincome. You’re better off overestimating than underestimating.
Of course, you may also have new sources of income. Coin-operated
laundry, clubhouse rental, carports, and storage fees may add up tosome serious cash. (Check out 
Property Management For Dummies,
2nd Edition, by Robert Griswold [Wiley] for more info about increas-
ing your income sources.)
Lenders want to see a complete breakdown of all the sources of
income and each line item expense. Work closely with a good,experienced commercial loan broker. You can expect your brokerto work hard to put together a comprehensive loan package andsubmit it to the proper lenders who specialize in this type offinancing. We guarantee it won’t be your local bank.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 137
If I were young again . . .
Many of my (Chip’s) first starter properties were duplexes, which provide a nice way
to cover the mortgage payment and live rent free! One of my first properties was atwo-family unit near the University of Michigan football stadium. We were even ableto earn extra income by charging for parking on Saturdays! One game could payfor an entire month’s mortgage — plus pizza and beer!
If I were to start all over again, at the age of 18, I would buy a four-family property
and finance it with an FHA loan. Multifamily units are 
great opportunities for enter-
ing into the world of investment real estate without exposing yourself to a great deal
of risk. You can get into the property for as little as a 3.5 percent down payment, andloan amounts can be more than $2 million. The loan amount limits do vary by county,but that’s a 
lotof wiggle room to find a property!14_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 137Crunching the numbers
When you’re in the market for a multifamily property (of whatever
size), carefully analyze the following numbers:
/H12012Annual income: Calculate what the total annual income
would be if allthe units were rented out for all12 months.
(Keeping all the units rented can be costly in both time and
effort, but for the purposes of these calculations, assume thatall units are rented out.)
/H12012Annual expenses: Include taxes, insurance, maintenance,
landscaping, management, telephone, utilities — everything
except the loan payment, which comes into play later. Tally upthe expenses for all units for all 12 months of the year.
/H12012Annual repair/replacement expense: In rental units, you
need to replace refrigerators, stoves, carpet, and other fix-
tures on a regular schedule. The easiest way to calculate theannual repair/replacement expense is to estimate the expensefor a single unit at about $200 per year and multiply that bythe number of units. For a 20-unit property, you can expect topay about $4,000 annually in repair and replacement costs.
For a more accurate estimate, calculate the repair and
replacement costs of all fixtures in each unit. For example, theaverage life of a refrigerator is seven years. For a 12-unit prop-erty, that’s 12 refrigerators over the course of seven years, orabout 1.7 refrigerators per year. If you estimate the cost of arefrigerator at $500, that works out to $850 per year.
/H12012Annual mortgage payments: Use a mortgage calculator to
figure the monthly loan payment including principal and inter-
est. Multiply the monthly loan payment by 12 to determinethe annual cost of the loan.
Up to this point, you have a bunch of meaningless numbers. Thefollowing formula shows you how to use these numbers to make awell-informed purchase decision.
Say you’re looking at a 12-unit property that you’re pretty sure you
can purchase for $785,000. You do the calculations explained ear-lier and come up with the following results:
/H12012Annual income: $120,000
/H12012Annual expenses: $23,180
/H12012Annual repair/replacement expense: $2,520
/H12012Annual mortgage payments: $55,296Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 13814_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 138Now you’re ready to crunch the numbers. Start with the total
annual income (all units together) and subtract all the expenses todetermine the property’s potential annual cash flow. Here’s how itworks in our example:
$120,000 – $23,180 – $2,520 – $55,296 = $39,004
The $39,004 represents a return of slightly less than 5 percent:
$39,004 ÷ $785,000 = 4.97 percent
If you can bump up the rent, lower expenses, or figure out othercreative ways to increase the annual income by being a savvy land-lord, you can improve your return on your investment.
This less-than-5-percent return represents only the minimum
return you’re getting. Your actual return on your investment islikely to be much greater when you take the following into account:
/H12012You’re not paying cash for the property. Say you put 25 per-
cent down on the property and borrowed the rest. Your totalinvestment isn’t $785,000 but rather $196,250 (25 percent of$785,000). Divide that $39,004 by $196,250 rather than$785,000 and you quickly see that your actual annual return isa more like 20 percent!
/H12012The calculations don’t include appreciation. If property values
increase, you stand to earn even more when you ultimatelysell the property (although you can’t always count on that).
Buying and Renting Out Office
Space: The A-to-D Grading Scale
If midnight calls from tenants about clogged toilets aren’t your cup
of tea, you may want to look at investing in office properties.Although the risk is a little greater — people don’t really need anoffice as they do a home, which could result in greater vacanciesduring economic slowdowns — this option offers plenty of perks. Italso comes with a whole new set of income streams and expenses.
If the idea of renting office space to businesses appeals to you,
start looking for opportunities. (For tips on finding great proper-ties, check out 
Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies by
Peter Conti and Peter Harris.)Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 13914_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 139Lenders break down office properties into different grades on an A
through D basis. The nice new shiny office complex out by the newshopping mall is the star pupil, earning an A for attracting high-rent tenants and commanding higher rents per square foot. The120-year-old building in the heart of the downtown warehouse dis-trict may be lucky to squeak by with a D both in terms of pricingand risk. Although different lenders may grade properties differ-ently, the grading is typically pretty consistent — it’s based onarea, age of building, condition, and quality of tenancy (reflected insquare footage income).
The higher grade the property, the easier it is to get that property
financed. You have more lenders and more options to choose from.As you go down the scale, credit tightens and interest rates rise.Reserve and maintenance costs also go up. Another problem isthat many older office buildings aren’t up to current code require-ments. If the building lacks a sprinkler system, for example,lenders don’t even consider financing the purchase.
Before giving careful consideration to an office building, check with
your commercial mortgage broker or real estate agent to see whatthe property’s grade is right upfront. Generally speaking, we rec-ommend that you invest in A and B grade properties. Someinvestors like the C and D properties because they’re less expen-sive both to purchase and maintain — tenants don’t expect thefloors to reflect like glass. Just be aware that renting these lower-graded properties may be more challenging.
Investing in Retail Real Estate
Retail properties include strip malls, small convenience stores,
single-tenant-occupied (STO) properties such as big-box stores, and
even large retail malls. These units can all be great investments,particularly for those who already run a retail operation and wantto offset their own operational expenses — sort of like owning amultifamily property and living in one of the units rent-free.
The calculations for evaluating these investments are the same as
those you’d use to evaluate other commercial properties, but theline items for income and expenses differ, as we reveal in the fol-lowing sections.
If you own a retail operation and buy a property, put the property
in a separate LLC and then charge yourself rent. You can thendeduct 100 percent of the rent as a business expense. (If you ownthe building, you have to calculate depreciation, reducing yourPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 14014_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 140write-offs.) Your attorney can prepare the necessary documenta-
tion and ensure that all the pieces are in order.
Collecting your cut of gross sales
Income on retail property is essentially the same as income you
can expect from an office building (see “Estimating the IncomePotential of a Commercial Property” earlier in this chapter), withone major difference: With retail property, you can expect an addi-tional bonus — a percentage of gross sales.
Owners of mid-size to large retail centers commonly charge ten-
ants a percentage of their sales as part of their leases. This prac-tice makes sense; after all, you’re boosting each merchant’s salesby offering a convenient place with a high profile to attract shop-pers. You’re investing in additional repairs and signage and con-necting merchants with other high-profile tenants. You earn apercentage of those sales.
When you’re estimating the income potential of your commercial
property, be sure to include commissions as part of the property’sincome. See “Estimating the Income Potential of a CommercialProperty” near the beginning of this chapter for details. For moreabout charging tenants a percentage of their sales, check out
Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies .Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 141
Charging for consumer traffic
As the owner of a retail center, you’re at least partially responsible for attracting
the consumer traffic that drives sales. Consider an airport, for example. A major air-port attracts hundreds of thousands of people every day, and airport executivesknow that this consumer traffic is a commodity they can sell to merchants lookingfor store space and advertising.
Most airports have stores and restaurants. Sure, most of the merchants pay a set
monthly fee as part of their rent, but the airports usually collect significantly moremoney by charging merchants a percentage of their gross sales.
In the same way, a small kids’ clothing store is going to attract much more traffic if
it’s in the same strip mall that includes a major retailer. By charging a percentageof the clothing store’s sales, the strip mall owner is charging the store a premium forthe right to coexist with this consumer-traffic magnet.
Remember, if you have retail property in a great location, you’re probably paying a
premium price for it. To help offset the cost and make your property a better incomegenerator, don’t hesitate to charge your tenants a higher percentage of sales.14_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 141Comparing strip malls and 
convenience stores
Retail strip malls (sometimes known as strip centers ) that contain
between 4 and 20 individual or combined storefronts can be a
great investment. Lenders love these types of properties, espe-cially newer buildings located in high-traffic areas because they’rerelatively much less risky. 
Convenience stores , also referred to as 
C-stores (places where you can usually get a soda or a bag of chips
at any time of the day or night) can also be good investments and
attractive to lenders because they tend to stay in business longerthan most other stores.
Lenders want to see the income and expense numbers (which the
seller should be able to supply), as well as market data showingretail traffic patterns and area growth. Also ask for tax returns onthe business so you can verify what the seller tells you. For data ontraffic patterns and area growth, check with your local chamber ofcommerce, commercial real estate agents, visitor and conventionbureaus, or economic development departments.
Be very careful about investing in a C-store that functions (or for-
merly functioned) as a gas station. The environmental risks are toogreat for most lenders, so these properties are almost impossibleto finance. If you’re considering such a property, check with yourbroker first to locate a current source of funding before you makean offer. For additional details, refer to “Gas stations” later in thischapter.
Running Your Own Hotel or Motel
If the movie Psycho didn’t scare you clear of your dreams of
becoming the owner and manager of a local hotel or motel, maybe
we can do it for you. You really need to know what you’re doing inthis arena to be successful — it’s not for the faint of heart.
If you really want to get involved in these sorts of properties, con-
sider investing in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that spe-cializes in hotels and motels to get your feet wet. Doing so spreadsout the risk and allows you to get much-needed experience beforeventuring out on your own.
Still interested? Keep in mind that fewer lenders are eager to
finance the purchase of hotels and motels, and those who are will-ing to consider it want to see stronger numbers than they’d requirefor multifamily, office, or retail properties. The risks are greater tothe lender, so they want to see that the property has a greaterPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 14214_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 142profit potential. The good news is that the reward should be better
for you as an investor.
In the following sections, we bring you up to speed on the basics of
evaluating hotels and motels.
Distinguishing between flagged and
unflagged properties
When you’re in the market for a hotel or motel, keep in mind the
differences between flagged and unflagged properties:
/H12012Flagged: Properties associated with a national chain or 
franchise.
/H12012Unflagged: Independently operated hotels or motels not 
connected with a national chain or franchise.
Lenders prefer flagged properties because they tend to carry less
risk. In the following sections, we break down the differences ingreater detail.
Flagged properties
Flagged properties are premium real estate for several reasons,
including the following:
/H12012They generally have higher occupancy rates.
/H12012They offer greater support in the form of national reservation
systems, online booking, payment-processing systems, groupreservations, and many other benefits.
/H12012Consumers know what to expect and, as a result, are less hesi-
tant to book a room. (On the flip side, you may have to jumpthrough hoops to meet the strict set of criteria set by higher-end chains.)
/H12012You may be able to finance the purchase directly through the
chain itself under certain conditions. If not, guarantees andconcessions from the chain can improve your chances ofobtaining attractive financing.
Amenities, age, location, proximity to other chain properties, man-agement, and the property’s physical condition all play a part inhow lenders flag a property and how it performs financially.
Make sure you work with a commercial loan broker who has
access to specific hotel/motel lenders.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 14314_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 143Unflagged properties
Due to their lack of national exposure and support, unflagged prop-
erties are much more difficult to finance. Lenders take a very criti-cal approach to the income and expense numbers, especially if youhave little or no experience in running successful hotel or motelestablishments.
The only real advantage of owning an unflagged property is that
you don’t have to pay national franchising fees. Other than that,unflagged properties offer no clear advantages.
Encountering income challenges
When dealing with hotel and motel properties, expect to face a
whole new set of income and expense categories, including the following:
/H12012Convention tax or visitors fee: Taxes may be computed differ-
ently based upon occupancy numbers. In addition, trans-
portation such as airport shuttles, taxis, or bus service mayaffect the rates.
/H12012Use fees: Resorts that use other public or private amenities
such as lakes, health clubs, casinos, parks, or nature pre-
serves may also be subject to use fees or membershiprequirements.
/H12012Costs of meeting government requirements: Bed-and-
breakfasts (known as B and Bs) have to be careful of zoning
restrictions, business licenses, and health departmentrequirements. Because most of these businesses are residential-turned-commercial properties, the property maybe subject to additional upgrades such as Americans withDisabilities Act (ADA) requirements or expensive sprinklersystem installations.
As a general rule, hotel/motel properties pose greater risk to thelender and require a higher Debt Service Coverage Ratio, or DSCR.
DSCR is the number that lenders use to evaluate the risk versus
the rewards. To calculate the DSCR, you first need to calculate theproperty’s NOI, as discussed in Chapter 3. Divide the NOI by theannual debt service on the loan (total annual payments on theloan, including interest and principal). If, for example, a propertyhas an NOI of $60,000 and the total loan payments for the year are$50,000, the DSCR is $60,000 ÷ $50,000, which equals 1.20. A DSCRof 1.00 means that the property is breaking even. Typical DSCRsare between 1.04 and 1.50. A hotel/motel would need to come inPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 14414_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 144about 1.30 to get approved in today’s market (a slow market at the
time of writing this book).
The higher the ratio, the better the deal — and the better the
financing options. Ask the lender or loan officer about the DSCRrequirements for the types of properties that interest you. This cankeep you from wasting time on properties that don’t come near tomeeting the lender’s DSCR requirements.
Checking Out Industrial or
Warehouse Properties
At first glance, you may think that industrial or warehouse proper-
ties are the simplest investments to finance and manage, but theycome with their own challenges. In the following sections, weexplore the unique costs you’re likely to encounter, introduce stor-age facility opportunities, and warn you about zoning and useissues related to these types of properties.
You can finance the purchase of industrial and warehouse proper-
ties through a variety of lenders, but as with any type of commer-cial property, the numbers need to work. Consult with a brokerwho can put you in touch with the right lenders and assist you incrunching the numbers.
For any industrial or warehouse type of facility, make sure to check
with the local building department and zoning board to under-stand the present zoning restrictions, limitations on use, and anygrandfather clauses in place under present operations. Those regu-lations can change with a change in ownership, and you don’t wantto get caught by surprise!
Calculating income and costs
With industrial and warehouse properties, you calculate rent and
income on a square-foot basis, just as you do with retail space.Multiply the net rental square footage by the annual rental incomeper square foot to estimate your annual rental income from theproperty.
Expense categories are generally much different, however, and
include purchase and maintenance of loading docks, forklifts,major heating and cooling systems, truck bays, and structuralcomponents.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 14514_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 145Some industrial properties also lend themselves to special permits,
wastewater discharge requirements, and neighborhood noiserestrictions. Check all the regulations before proceeding with aninvestment of this nature.
Considering storage facilities
Those self-storage facilities that blemish the U.S. landscape rarely
seem so ugly to investors because they can be great investments.They enable you to spread the risk among dozens or even hundredsof tenants and require little maintenance (and no refrigerators toreplace). Income is straightforward on a per-unit, per-month basis,and expenses are limited mostly to external maintenance issues.
Check with your commercial loan broker to connect with lenders
who specialize in financing the purchase of self-storage units.
Exploring Mixed-Use Properties
Mixed-use properties are those that combine any of the functions
covered previously in this chapter; for example, a multifamily
apartment that includes a grocery on the first floor or an officecomplex that has retail shopping inside.
Financing for mixed-use properties can become rather compli-
cated. Lenders who provide financing for office buildings may loseinterest if you’re planning to add a restaurant, making it a riskierproposition. As the risk to the lender rises, loan costs and interestrates rise accordingly, and you need to budget for them.
When evaluating the income and expenses, break out each portion
separately and then combine the totals. This practice allows you tochange the lender package easily, if necessary, to illustrate differenttenancy income/expense flows or restructure the transaction.
Sampling Some Special Use
Properties
With all the different types of properties out there, some just don’t
fit into any square box like the rest. These are known as special use
properties. Common special use properties include restaurants andPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 14614_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 146bars, gas stations, and adult foster care facilities. We cover financ-
ing considerations for these beasts in the following sections.
More specialized properties in this category include churches,
casinos, theme parks, golf courses, and bowling alleys, which areall too specialized for us to cover in this book. Check out
Commercial Real Estate Investing For Dummies to get a complete
picture of what properties like these really entail.
Special use properties are much more difficult to finance and
require special lenders and preparation. For all practical purposes,novice investors would do best to steer clear of these properties.
Restaurants and bars
Although lenders are just as likely as anyone else to eat out or
drop in at the local watering hole, they generally avoid financingrestaurants and bars. Almost all these establishments fail withinfive years, leaving lenders to deal with the hangovers.
The exception would be for an established franchise (or flagged)
property with a proven track record, or destination-type proper-ties such as a Chuck E. Cheese or a microbrewery (and no, youcan’t combine those two!)
If you’re committed to buying a restaurant or bar, your best bet for
obtaining financing is through hard-money lenders (see Chapter 11),seller financing (also see Chapter 11), or local banks (not likely), inthat order.Chapter 8: Picking the Right Commerical Property Type for You 147
Look that gift horse in the mouth
I (Chip) once financed a property for an industrial manufacturing company that was
given a new piece of equipment by General Motors. Nice gift — it was worth wellmore than $1 million. The catch was that the warehouse floor had to be rebuilt witha six-foot concrete slab! Yes, it was quite expensive.
The take-home lesson is this: Budget for your expenses upfront. If I hadn’t budgeted
for this expense, it would have been a hidden expense that could have really takena chunk out of my bottom line.14_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 147Gas stations
A few lenders out there take chances on financing gas stations, but
the station must be newer and have EPA-certified tanks (as opposedto the old steel tanks that may end up leaking).
Due to the possibility of past tank leakage and the environmental
issues and cleanup costs associated with contaminated soil, mostlenders don’t consider financing these properties. Inexperiencedinvestors should avoid these types of properties, too. Even proper-ties now used for something else (but with a history of under-ground gas or oil storage tanks) pose a problem for an investorseeking financing. It’s not impossible, but it’s definitely a muchbigger challenge.
Financing often is available through the distributor (such as Shell
or Sunoco). Options are much better if the station is combinedwith a convenience store or fast-food operation.
Adult foster care
With the graying of America, demand has increased for adult foster
care, but these properties can be difficult to finance and come withtheir own set of legal and practical challenges. Some nationallenders may be willing to do the deals, but do your homework toprotect your interests and those of the lender. Check zoning require-ments, ADA and licensing requirements, and state health records forhistories of violations, sanctions, or limited use restrictions.
Group homes and primary child-care facilities are treated the same
way, and the same lenders are the primary source of financing forthese properties. A residential home in which the homeowner runsa small part-time day care facility wouldn’t be subject to theseguidelines; instead, it would be eligible for standard residentialfinancing (as long as the day care constituted less than 25 percentof the total use).Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 14814_422335-ch08.qxp  3/11/09  11:52 AM  Page 148Chapter 9

When financing commercial property you can’t always find
money in the usual places. In some cases, for example, you
may be able to obtain loans for commercial properties that aresecured by the Small Business Administration (SBA). You can’t getthat money when you’re buying houses! In other cases, you may beable to combine a few sources to get a project off the ground —perhaps purchasing the property with a commercial loan and thenfixing it up with a rehabilitation loan.
If you want to purchase a commercial property, you need a firm
grasp on the financing options available to you. In this chapter, welead you on a quest for cash to finance your acquisition and devel-opment of commercial properties. When you’re aware of all the dif-ferent programs available, you can then begin to mix and match tocome up with your own creative financing plans.15_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 149Sizing Up Various Commercial
Loan Programs
When you’re searching for a commercial loan, the resources aren’t
nearly as useful as when you’re buying a home to live in. Sure, youcan (and should) trek down to your local bank to see what it has tooffer or dial up the lender that currently services the mortgage onyour two-family unit for a quick source of financing. They may beable to assist you, but in all likelihood, commercial lending isn’ttheir specialty, and it’s likely to end up costing you more — both inmoney and hassles — than other alternatives.
You may be better off dealing with lenders who specialize in financ-
ing commercial real estate deals. In addition to having a clearerunderstanding of your goals, these lenders know what’s availableand reasonable in the current market. When choosing a commer-cial loan program, you have three options: middle market, hardmoney, and conduit loans. The following sections describe thesethree options.
Exploring the middle market (local
and national banks)
Local and regional banks comprise the middle market — lenders
who deal in loan amounts from $50,000 to $2 million. Although
your bank may not be the best place to score a commercial loan(depending on market conditions), it’s one of the best places tobegin your search. Local and regional banks love to find qualityprojects in their areas because they can evaluate and monitor therisk and performance much more easily.
Pros
Financing your commercial venture through a local bank offers sev-
eral distinct advantages:
/H12012You have many lenders to choose from.
/H12012A bank may be willing to consider unique or complex deals.
/H12012A bank is more likely than a conduit lender to accept lower
loan amounts — typically starting as low as $50,000.
/H12012You may be able to work with your bank to combine other
types of financing, such as loans that use inventory or operat-ing capital as collateral. (See “Considering other potentialsources of capital” later in this chapter for details.)Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 15015_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 150Cons
Because banks tend to be more averse to risk than other types of
lenders, financing through a bank has several potential drawbacks:
/H12012Interest rates and terms are higher.
/H12012A bank is likely to require that you move all your accounts
(personal savings account, business accounts, and so on) toits institution.
/H12012A bank may not be willing to approve large loans.
/H12012Banks can change the type of properties they’re willing to
finance on very short notice.
Pitching your deal to the bank
Taking out a commercial loan through a bank requires that you
proceed through entirely different channels than you’re accus-tomed to. Start with the bank’s manager, who can refer you to oneof the bank’s commercial loan officers.
Most commercial loan officers are paid on commission — which
works to your advantage. They get paid only if and when you getthe loan, so they’re motivated to make it work. Spend some timegetting to know the loan officer. Ask for his input on how to struc-ture the deal. Ask for a commercial loan package, or at least howhe wants the information presented.
The only thing that matters in getting the deal done is the num-
bers. Yes, you need to demonstrate that you’re a strong borrowerwith good credit, cash in the bank, and a solid investment back-ground, but in the end, these qualities only reinforce the decision.Eighty to 90 percent of the decision hinges on the property’s num-bers. Be prepared with an income statement for the property, rentrolls, balance sheets, tax returns, bank statements, personal finan-cials, and a resume — the loan officer wants to see that you havethe skills and experience to handle the transaction.
Hitting up the private sector: 
Hard-money lenders
Thanks to the mortgage meltdown that started in 2008, hard
money may be the only money you can get your mitts on for somedeals. Hard-money lenders are private individuals, finance groups,and small- to mid-size specialty finance companies that concen-trate on lending money to real estate investors.
Going the hard-money route has its advantages and disadvantages.
Check out Chapter 11 for the complete lowdown on hard money.Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 15115_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 151Financing Main Street property 
with Wall Street money
Using commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS for short),
conduit lenders provide financing through Wall Street investment
firms to commercial real estate investors. The lenders allot the
funds in huge pools based on the type of investment property —retail, office, multifamily housing, and so on — and they rate thesecurities based on their risk and performance.
Conduit lenders typically deal only with high-quality borrowers and
properties — and in larger loan amounts. These loans are most suit-able (and only available) for large multifamily projects (200+ units),shopping centers, large office complexes, and similar types of prop-erties. You must have a good track record for making payments anda proven ability to make profitable commercial investments.
Pros
Financing commercial real estate ventures through conduit loans
offers several advantages:
/H12012Financing is readily available.
/H12012Interest rates and terms are more attractive than with other
forms of financing.
/H12012Financing terms and property requirements are more stan-
dardized and predictable.
/H12012You have numerous lenders to choose from.
Cons
Conduit loans aren’t always a viable (or the most attractive) form
of financing for commercial ventures. Here are some of the reasons:
/H12012Minimum loan amounts are typically $2.5 million or more.
/H12012To qualify, you must have very strong credit and show that
the property has a solid cash flow potential.
/H12012Property standards are very specific with regard to higher
quality, income performance, and newer construction stan-dards, which can exclude many properties from consideration.
/H12012If you sell or refinance the property before the term is up, you
may face stiff prepayment penalties.
/H12012Older properties or ones located in more run-down or neg-
lected areas of town typically aren’t eligible.Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 15215_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 152With the collapse of several large Wall Street investment firms in
2008 (including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and others), con-duit options are becoming scarce and very picky.
Tracking down conduit lenders
Finding large conduit lenders can be tricky. They work only
through commercial mortgage lenders and brokers, so the bestplace to start is with an experienced commercial broker.
Get some referrals from your state mortgage association or ask
experienced real estate developers in your area. Another option isto do a little research down at your county recorder’s office. Lookup and contact the lender of record for a large complex. In mostcases, the lender won’t work with you directly but can refer you toone of its local or regional lending reps.
Prepping for your first meeting
When dealing with conduit lenders, you’re playing in the major
leagues and dealing with big money, so be prepared. A good loanrep can help you put together an Executive Loan Summary (ELS)that lays out the entire proposal. Concentrate on the numbers.Make sure you know them inside and out, and have all the data toback up why this property makes financial sense. You need to sellit to the rep before it goes to the underwriter.
Pursuing Government Loans
Only one person in this country has an endless supply of money.
No, it’s not Bill Gates or even Warren Buffet. It’s your rich UncleSam, who has his own printing press specifically designed to churnout those greenbacks. When credit is tight, Uncle Sam actively triesto stimulate the economy by making money available to investorsand developers just like you.
Several agencies help Uncle Sam make money more available,
including the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and the SmallBusiness Administration (SBA). In the following sections, weexplore these options and other related opportunities.
Financing housing and medical
facilities through FHA loans
When most people hear about FHA financing, they assume it’s
related to government-secured loans for buying single-familyhomes like we discuss in Chapter 5. However, FHA also insuresChapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 15315_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 153financing for the purchase or development of multifamily homes
(at least 100 units) and medical facilities.
To pursue this source of financing, track down a commercial FHA
lender (not a residential lender). FHA-approved commerciallenders are scarce, but you can locate them by talking to a localcommercial loan officer or searching online for “HUD multifamilyfinancing.”
Only a handful of commercial lenders are FHA approved. Make
sure you check them out thoroughly online and through HUD bycalling the HUD regional office listed on the Web site (
www.hud.
gov). Ask how long the lender has been approved and whether it
has any sanctions against it. (From HUD’s home page, navigate to
the Multifamily Industry page to access information specifically forcommercial topics. For descriptions of multifamily housing pro-grams, go directly to 
www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/progdesc/
progdesc.cfm .)
After you’ve found an FHA-approved commercial lender, present
the property you’re planning to purchase and ask for a quote. If theproperty qualifies, you may also be eligible for Section 8 housingpayment guarantees. With these guarantees in place, the govern-ment makes up the difference if you lease to low-income rentersand they can’t pay the rent.
Tapping into economic development
funds and grants
Many states and large cities provide financing for real estate prop-
erties as part of an economic development fund or grant. Usuallyrestricted to downtown development areas or 
revitalization dis-
tricts, these loans can come with low interest rates, low costs, and
some nice perks, such as tax abatements or investment incentives.
Transforming abandoned warehouses into fashionable loft apart-ments or rehabbing run-down brownstone apartments are perfectcandidates for these types of financing programs.
If you’re looking at commercial property located in a revitalization
district, contact the state housing authority and the city or countyeconomic development office to find out how to tap into thesefinancing sources.
Securing a loan through the SBA
SBA-insured loans are a great way to finance the purchase of a
building that houses business owners and can even be used toPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 15415_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 154finance start-up capital and inventory. Many self-owned restau-
rants, bars, grocery stores, and other businesses are financedthrough SBA programs 7(a) and 504, as discussed in the followingsections.
The SBA requires a personal guarantee from every borrower, doesn’t
offer 100 percent financing, and provides outright grants only tononprofit organizations. We can’t really recommend one programover the other, because they both have pros and cons and are usedfor quite different situations (as discussed in the following sections).The best way to evaluate the two options is to obtain quotes fromlenders that compare the numbers side by side specifically relatedto your property and financing needs.
For more detailed information on obtaining one of these loans, go
to 
www.sba.gov or check out the online presentation of the pro-
gram at www.sba.gov/services/financialassistance/
index.html . Most SBA loans are provided through local and
regional banks, so start there.
SBA’s 7(a) loan program
The 7(a) is the most common SBA-insured loan available. You can
use it for an existing or new business, and it can include acquisi-tion of land, buildings, machinery, furniture, supplies, inventory,working capital, or even buying the business itself. Following arethe rules governing eligibility:
/H12012Limited to businesses with fewer than 100 employees (500 for
manufacturing companies).
/H12012Can’t have more than $21 million in annual sales ($17.5 million
for construction companies).
/H12012Term can be up to 25 years (10 years for working capital).
/H12012Rates are market rate — usually adjustable tied to the prime
rate (the rate that banks charge one another).
/H12012Guaranteed amount to the bank or lender is typically 
75 percent and limited to $1.5 million per business.
SBA’s 504 loan program
The 504 program is an economic development program designed to
stimulate the economy and create new jobs. Here are the eligibilityrules:
/H12012Minimum 10 percent contribution required by Certified
Development Company (CDC) or from the borrower.
/H12012Must create or retain 1 job per $35,000 of SBA support.Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 15515_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 155/H12012Business plan must demonstrate that the loan will support
local economic growth through new jobs, manufacturing, or atype of business that will attract other industry.
/H12012Ideal candidates for these types of loans include companies
involved in high-tech development, green-energy research anddevelopment, or experimental medical technologies.
/H12012Similar to the 7(a) program, the interest rate and term is close
to other market rates and programs, and is tied to an indexsuch as the prime interest rate. Other local or state grant pro-grams may also be available for part of the financing to reflecta lower blended interest rate.
Harvesting investment capital
through the USDA
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does a lot more than
inspect chickens and cows and make sure your milk gets pasteur-ized. It also works hard to encourage investment in agriculture andrelated activities. As such, it often finances a variety of projects —from warehouses to high-tech research facilities — through itsBusiness and Industry Guaranteed Loan (B&I loan). The B&I loan isdesigned for real estate, equipment, working capital, and refinanc-ing non-farm operations.
The one major requirement for a B&I loan is that the property has
to be located in a rural area (or city with fewer than 50,000people). Other conditions include the following:
/H12012Loan amounts are between $1 million and $10 million.
/H12012Loans require a guarantee program similar to the SBA’s. (See
“Securing a loan through the SBA” earlier in this chapter.)
/H12012Loans are offered at market rates and terms.
Unlike FHA and SBA loans, these loans actually go directly through
the USDA. It may refer you to one of its bank partners, but it canand does handle most loans directly. Contact a regional districtoffice to obtain a loan package and detailed requirements. Oneproblem with these loans is that the USDA has only so much fund-ing available and can actually 
run out of funds until the govern-
ment’s new fiscal year provides a fresh appropriation.
The USDA offers several other grant programs and minority busi-
ness finance programs. For more information, visit www.rurdev.
usda.gov/rbs/busp/b&i_gar.htm .Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 15615_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 156Getting a hold of a CDBG
Community development block grants (CDBGs) are available to
investors for acquiring and rehabilitating commercial properties inrun-down areas.
To qualify for a CDBG, you need to write a grant proposal, which
can be complicated. Every grant has unique requirements inrespect to forms, time frame, type of properties, program guide-lines, and approval. Network with other real estate investors to findsomeone who’s participated in a recently approved grant and askfor his or her assistance. You may need to hire someone who reallyknows the system. (For more about writing grants, check out 
Grant
Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Beverly A. Browning [Wiley].)
In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), established in
1977, requires lenders to invest locally. For these types of projects,your property must be associated with a nonprofit organization orbe serving an underserved segment of the local market. Inner-city,community-group, and nonprofit projects are perfect fits.
Every bank has to provide a certain amount of CRA funding each
year, depending on its size and lending area. The loans are usuallytied to specific types of properties or groups, including minorities,community groups, Habitat for Humanity, and so on. The bank usually wants some good PR out of it (although it rarely says so).Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 157
What exactly does FHA do?
As part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FHA has
been lending money to finance both large and small housing projects since the1930s. Its primary goal is to assist in making affordable housing available for U.S.citizens, which also helps stimulate the economy.
Technically speaking, the FHA doesn’t really lend money. It insures loans from banks
and other qualified lending institutions. This insurance is great for lenders, becauseit enables them to lend money with confidence, knowing that if the borrower defaultson the loan, the FHA will step in and cover any loss. It’s great for borrowers, too,because it gives them access to lower-cost loans at greater LTVs than banks wouldnormally consider. (Check out Chapter 3 for more on LTV.)
It’s a true win-win!15_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 157Deconstructing Construction Loans
Prior to mid-2008, new construction was big business, and construc-
tion loans were readily available. The market meltdown changed all
that. Now when you apply for a construction loan, all the lenderssee is risk with a capital 
R.(A construction loan is one that’s used to
finance the development of new homes or buildings. The big differ-
ence between construction loans and other real estate loans is thatyou don’t get the money all at once. Instead, the bank doles out thecash when each phase of the project is completed and passesinspection.)
Due to recent credit changes, construction loans are harder to come
by for commercial projects. Technically, these loans are still avail-able, but you’d better have a strong package to get the funding.
Before you even think about sitting down with prospective lenders,
put together a 
pro forma — a document/report that projects the
income and expenses for at least a three-year period after comple-
tion (refer to Chapter 8). You should also have a contingency planin place if the numbers don’t hit expectations.
Here’s some of what you can expect when pursuing a construction
loan:
/H12012Short term loans — typically only up to three years
/H12012Financing only on strong projects with proven income streams
/H12012Lower L TVs with strong borrower credit requirements and
personal guarantees
In a soft (slumping) market, you need to show that whatever you’replanning to build is almost guaranteed to generate a positive cashflow. Be prepared to provide complete blueprints and constructionspecifications, a completion timeline, and occupancy projections,as well as pre-lease agreements. Some lenders require that a build-ing be more than 75 percent pre-leased before construction can begin.
Financing Fixes with 
Rehabilitation Loans
Securing financing for a fixer-upper is often easier than convincing
a lender to bankroll an entirely new building — as long as the num-bers come out right. 
Rehabilitation loans involve properties that
will maintain at least 25 percent of the existing structure. The Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 15815_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 158projects can involve a total do-over (essentially gutting the property)
or just a quick fix-up job.
Middle-market local and regional banks are the best bet for rehab
loans. Call and talk to one of the bank’s commercial loan reps tosee whether it does rehab loans and what its specific L TV and proforma requirements are. Many banks shy away from these loansduring market slowdowns unless they’re presented with a verystrong deal.
After you’ve scoped out some lenders who do rehabilitation loans,
you need to crunch the numbers to prove that your project is amoney-maker. Draw up a comprehensive plan that includes abreakdown of all improvements and materials, blueprints, andspecifications. Include a pro forma, as discussed in the previoussection, showing the return on the investment. If you can’t show apositive cash flow without fudging the numbers, don’t do the deal.
Don’t over-improve yourself out of a profit. Spending $550,000 on a
building where the leases are fixed for the next three years makesno sense. Be sure you can recover your investment in a reasonableamount of time.
Exploring Other Creative 
Financing Options
Taking out a loan is the most obvious way to finance your commer-
cial real estate venture, but it’s certainly not the only way. Otherindividuals and organizations have money to lend or invest. If youcan’t find the money through traditional sources, consider themore creative financing options covered in the following sections.
Borrowing from pension programs
and life insurance companies
Pension programs and life insurance companies have large pools
of cash available for investing. Much of this cash is invested instocks and bonds, but many fund managers actively look for realestate investments to provide better returns than they can get inthe traditional markets:
/H12012Pension programs generally prefer conservative, short-term
loans on stable commercial properties such as multifamily
units, retail properties, and resort hotels. The loan amountstend to be larger, but they can be flexible on terms and rates.Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 15915_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 159/H12012Life insurance companies also look for more stable deals, but
they can provide a viable alternative to borrowing from 
conduit lenders.
You won’t be able to track down these opportunities by yourself —you have to work through a commercial lender or broker, just as if you were pursuing a conduit loan. See “Financing Main Streetproperty with Wall Street money” earlier in this chapter for details.
Enlisting the services of 
venture capitalists
Some people have more money than they know what to do with:
the venture capitalists (VCs) — individuals and companies who are
constantly on the lookout for new businesses and innovative tech-
nologies to invest in. Assuming a business or new technology ispromising enough, VCs are willing to finance everything, includingreal estate acquisition, redevelopment, and all the costs of startingand running the business, especially if it involves high-tech, bio-tech, medical technology, or other innovative operations.
Financing through VCs has advantages and disadvantages just like
any type of financing. The big plus is that they can write big checks.The major drawback is that you lose a lot of control over your busi-ness and its operations. If you’re running a high-tech business andwant to purchase real estate as part of the business, however, thismay be the solution for you.
VC firms specialize in niche markets, so talk to business brokers
who specialize in selling businesses within that niche. In otherwords, if you’re looking for VCs for a theme restaurant, talk to abroker who sells theme restaurants or franchises. She can put youin touch with venture capitalists, but she may charge a finder’s fee.
Grab a copy of 
Entrepreneur Magazine and flip to the back to find
listings for VC firms. Other publications and newsletters for busi-
ness owners and entrepreneurs often contain similar listings. Startlocally and then go online to research the VCs you turn up throughyour local search in depth. After you’ve found a few promising can-didates, interview them and check references on recent projectsthey’ve done to determine their 
pull-through rate (what they 
actually produce versus what they promise).
Many venture capital firms are equally interested in the overall
concept of the business plan and real estate development as muchas the financial picture. They can be much more flexible on thereturns, especially if the short-term numbers aren’t extremelyPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 16015_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 160strong but the long-term potential looks great. Make sure your pro
forma is very conservative and extends out at least five years.
Sharing the costs and the equity
Some lenders are willing to loan investors money only if they can
get a little piece of the action — equity in a property. For larger realestate transactions or very unique situations that involve severalinvestors, you may want to explore the possibility of some equity-sharing arrangement by way of an equity loan.
With an 
equity loan, you actually become partners with the bank or
investor. They provide the financing in exchange for equity in the
building or a portion of the cash flow or the actual business. Thisarrangement presents obvious drawbacks in terms of control anddecision-making with regards to the property and its use, but italso requires you to be more accountable to the transaction.
Consider equity-sharing only as a last resort, unless you’re looking
for partners who can offer you more than money. If you pitch yourplan to the last lender on your list and get a lukewarm “no,” thisusually means that the lender likes the deal, but it’s just bigger thanhis budget or appetite. Ask whether he’d be more interested if hisrisk and exposure were reduced by bringing in another partner orlender or giving him a piece of the project. In most cases, theanswer is still “no,” but you never know until you ask.
If you do decide to move forward on such an arrangement, consult
a qualified accountant and an attorney to write up a limited agree-ment. We recommend limiting your partner’s share to no morethan 49 percent of the outstanding equity. Also include a maximumfive-year buyout provision with a first-right-of-refusal so you canprotect any growth in the equity. See Chapter 13 for more on part-nerships and partnership agreements.
Participating in participation loans
With a participation loan, several lenders chip in to share the costs,
risks, and potential profits with one another and the borrower/
investor. Participation loans are common in large commercialtransactions that involve community development projects, suchas a hotel attached to a new city convention center.
On these types of loans, several banks or financial institutions pro-
vide a portion of the financing, each taking a piece of the pie. Forexample, if no single lender is willing or able to finance the $20 mil-lion for the deal, they may split it up, with Bank A financing Chapter 9: Sources of Financing for Commercial Properties 16115_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 161$10 million, Bank B $6 million, and Bank C $2 million, with the bal-
ance coming from the borrower. In this case, Bank A is the primarylender, including the primary authority in decision making.
Don’t try to arrange these deals yourself. Enlist the assistance of a
qualified mortgage brokerage or banking firm to bring all the par-ties together, coordinate efforts, and manage all the in-fightingthat’s likely to occur as the lenders jockey for position.
Taking on a partner
For smaller, simpler commercial real estate acquisitions, you may
want to consider taking on a partner — one who has access to solidfinancial resources or the credit needed to qualify for financing.
If you decide to take on a partner, just make sure that all the expec-
tations and responsibilities are clearly laid out — in writing. Formore about partnering, check out Chapter 13.
Considering other potential 
sources of capital
Thanks to the mortgage meltdown and subsequent economic chal-
lenges that began in 2008, you may have to dig deeper to findfinancing for your commercial ventures. As you dig, here are a fewother options to consider:
/H12012Franchise financing: Many commercial properties used in
conjunction with a franchise operation are eligible for direct
financing with the parent company. Hotels such as Sheratonor Holiday Inn, restaurants such as KFC or Applebee’s, oreven a Baskin-Robbins ice-cream shop can find some cheapmoney through its franchise operation.
/H12012Inventory loans: If you have a business with a large amount of
inventory, you may be able to use that inventory as collateral
to finance the purchase of the property or at least part of it.
/H12012Accounts receivable: If you’re acquiring a property that serv-
ices a large vendor such as the U.S. government or United
Airlines, you may be able to use the value of future contractsas collateral for part of the down payment or financing. Somelarge companies even provide financing to suppliers for theirproduction facilities.Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 16215_422335-ch09.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 162Chapter 10

Your Commercial Venture

/H17075Making sense of the broker agreement
/H17075Tallying the broker fees and other costs
/H17075Covering your back with unbiased reports
/H17075Surviving the closing
When you’re borrowing money to buy a home to live in, the
lender wants to know that you’re earning enough money to
make the monthly mortgage payments. The focus is on you andyour finances — how much money you earn, how much cash youhave socked away in the bank, and your track record for payingyour bills on time.
When you’re buying commercial property, the focus shifts. The
lender is less concerned about you and your earning potential andmore concerned about the property’s earning potential. Because ofthis difference and others, financing a commercial venture is quitedifferent from financing the purchase of a residential property.
In this chapter, we lead you through the application and processing
of your commercial loan, so you know what to expect and can avoidthe most common pitfalls.
Deciphering the Broker-
Borrower Agreement
Although you can often deal directly with lenders to finance resi-
dential deals, you usually have to work through a broker or loanofficer on commercial deals. The broker or loan officer acts as themiddleman who puts you in touch with the lender and advises you16_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 163Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 164
on which loan programs are best for you and your investment
goals. (See Chapter 4 for more about brokers and loan officers.)
With commercial properties, the broker is likely to require that you
sign a broker-borrower agreement. A good commercial loan brokeris going to do a great deal of work on your behalf to search for,evaluate, and secure financing for your transaction. He wants tomake sure that you’re going to go through with the deal, so he canget paid. A well-written agreement also protects your rights.
Although no standard format governs such agreements, all of them
spell out the terms of the agreement, including the following:
/H12012Term of the engagement: The agreement should spell out
how long you’re retaining the broker to represent you. Limit
the term to a period of four to six months. If they haven’tfound any investors for you by then, it’s time to move on.
/H12012Exclusivity clause: A commercial broker may ask for exclusive
rights to represent you, meaning you can’t retain any other
commercial lenders or brokers during that period. Before you
sign the agreement, make sure you’re comfortable with yourselection. If your only broker drops the ball, you may be out ofthe game for several months. Try to avoid contracts with anexclusivity clause, or at least get a clause that lasts no longerthan 90 to 120 days. For particularly large or difficult transac-tions, you may have to provide a six-month window.
/H12012Loan acceptance terms: Specify the loan terms you’re willing
to accept; for example, you may want to specify a loan that
offers 80 percent loan-to-value (L TV) on a 25-year amortizationat 7 percent or better. Don’t set the bar so high, however, thatyour loan officer can’t possibly negotiate a deal.
Be careful what you ask for. If your broker finds a loan that
meets the terms you specified, you may be obligated to payyour broker regardless of whether the deal closes.
/H12012Non-circumvention clause: This part of the agreement pro-
hibits you from cutting your broker out of the deal and deal-
ing directly with the lender. This clause is no biggie becausecircumventing your broker is bad business anyway. 
/H12012Compensation: Any broker agreement spells out how much
you’re paying the broker. The fee is completely negotiable, but
expect it to run one to two points (1 or 2 percent) of the deal.
You generally pay a larger percentage for smaller loans and a
smaller percentage for larger loans. Negotiate with the brokeruntil you’re comfortable with the fee.
/H12012Retainer fee: Except for very small commercial transactions,
most brokers ask for a retainer, which covers his upfront
expenses and ties you to the contract. (An agreement isn’t16_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 164very binding if it has no cash tied to it.) In most cases, you
shouldn’t have to pay more than $2,000 — less for smallerdeals and more for larger ones. My (Chip’s) standard retaineris $2,000, but I’ve collected as much as $10,000 upfront on a$28 million deal.
Make sure any retainer fee is applied toward the overall com-
pensation. Also ask whether the fee is refundable (usually not)and under what circumstances.
/H12012Communication: Some agreements spell out specifically how
often you agree to communicate with one another. You should
expect updates from the broker about once a week. Thebroker may in turn require that you provide certain documen-tation within seven days to put together a loan proposal, forexample. This is a reasonable request; you can’t really expectthe broker to draw up a proposal together without it. On theflip side, the broker should agree to communicate with you ona regular basis and update you on the status of any loan offersor commitments.
/H12012Cancellation clause: The cancellation clause stipulates the
conditions under which you or the broker can cancel the
agreement. Make sure the agreement has a clause that enablesyou to cancel the agreement if the broker doesn’t deliver sat-isfactory results in a certain amount of time. For example, ifthe broker fails to deliver any financing prospects to you overthe course of a couple of months, you should probably belooking for the exits. Whatever the clause stipulates, makesure you understand and agree to it. If a dispute arises, youcan renegotiate parts of the contract, but this is where ashorter-term agreement can work in your favor; you cansimply let it expire.
Commercial lenders and brokers generally operate with less gov-ernment oversight. As a result, agreements aren’t required for com-mercial loan transactions, nor do you see the same disclosures asin residential transactions. Lenders aren’t required to produce aGood Faith Estimate (GFE) or Truth In Lending statement. Goodloan brokers, however, want to secure a written agreement withyou to make sure neither of you is wasting the other’s time.
Don’t sign any legally binding agreement without having your
attorney review it first, answer any questions you have about it,and advise you on the risks and benefits of signing.
Accounting for Upfront Fees
Unfortunately, that retainer you paid the broker in the previous
section covers the broker’s upfront fees, but it does nothing to coverChapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 16516_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 165your upfront fees. Here are the most common fees and costs you can
expect to encounter when you’re purchasing a commercial property:
/H12012Appraisal fee: Lenders always order an appraisal and make
you pay for it. Although the appraisal isn’t done until the
lender approves your loan request, you may have to pay for itupfront. Depending on the size and nature of the commercialproperty, the appraisal may cost anywhere from $1,500 to$5,000. For larger, more complex transactions, of course, thetotal may be much higher. Ask your loan officer for an esti-mate upfront.
/H12012Environmental fee: Depending on the type of property, what
it is (and was) used for, or even the surrounding neighbors,
you may need to have the soil tested for contaminants. Forexample, if you’re buying property near a defunct industrialplant or a building that once housed a dry cleaner, the soilmay have toxins. Find out from your loan broker whetherthese tests are going to be necessary and obtain an estimateof the cost.
/H12012Structural inspection: The lender may require certain types of
inspections and engineering reports, which can get very 
expensive — especially for manufacturing facilities. Ask aboutthe lender’s requirements and obtain an estimate for your area.
/H12012Commitment fee or loan guarantee fee: When the lender
issues a loan commitment or preliminary proposal approval,
it’s going to want you to make a commitment as well. Thisrequest is only fair — the lender is about to spend a lot ofeffort evaluating the loan package, underwriting the file,reserving the funds, and so on, so it needs some assurancethat you’re not going to get cold feet. The lender is likely torequire that you sign a commitment letter and submit a fee asspecified in the letter. You pay this standard, nonrefundablefee to the lender upon acceptance of the commitment — itdoesn’t go to the broker, nor is it part of the loan amount. Thefee should not exceed one to two percent of the loan amount,or a few thousand dollars for most transactions.
Before you sign off on the deal (by submitting the commitmentletter), realize that you still have some room to negotiate. In mostcases, the broker expects you to come back with a counteroffer onthe commitment fee or the loan terms offered. Don’t be too pushyhere, though; you don’t want to sink the deal and have to start allover from scratch. After you have a lender who’s committed,you’re 75 percent of the way there.Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 16616_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 166Obtaining Third-Party Reports
After you obtain a commitment with the lender or investor, you’ve
pretty much entered the final stretch and can be fairly confidentthat your deal is going to cross the finish line, but you’re not doneyet. You still need to gather some additional information about theproperty to protect both yourself and the investor from takingownership of a money pit.
Fortunately, other companies and individuals are well qualified to
gather the necessary information for you and deliver 
third-party
reports. These reports include
/H12012An appraisal
/H12012A survey
/H12012The property’s title and title history
/H12012An engineering report
/H12012An environmental inspection
In the following sections, we describe these third-party reports in
detail and point out common red flags to watch for.
Verifying a property’s market 
value with an appraisal
When financing a commercial property, the lender or investor
orders a commercial appraisal to answer two important questions:First, is the property worth the price? Second, can the propertygenerate more than enough revenue to cover the loan payments?
Although the lender orders the appraisal, you pay for it. After it’s
complete, get a copy for your records, and read it over carefully tomake sure that you’re not making a mistake in moving forward onthe deal. Make sure the appraisal shows that the property’s valueis in line with similar properties and that it has the potential togenerate the income you expect to earn from it. Your financialbackers should sound the sirens if the appraisal shows the deal isa dud, but your neck is on the chopping block, so perform yourown due diligence as well. The appraisal should simply supportthe calculations you’ve already done.
Commercial and residential appraisers differ significantly in terms
of training, experience, and process. A commercial appraisal offersa comprehensive review of the property, all systems and construc-tion, and similar types of commercial properties within a certainChapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 16716_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 167geographical area. It also includes something that residential
appraisals don’t — economic feasibility information. In otherwords, does the area really need another retail strip center, or howdoes this existing center perform compared to other retail stripcenters in neighboring communities?
In case you’re wondering about having the property inspected, the
appraisal usually serves this purpose, too. On larger commercialdeals, however, the lender’s representative inspects the propertyas part of the approval process . . . and, of course, charges you forthat inspection. You can expect the lender to disclose the cost ofany required inspection upfront.
Plotting the perimeter with a survey
Toward the tail end of the loan process, the lender is going to
order a survey, which you usually pay for as part of your closingcosts. The 
survey shows the property’s boundaries — its perime-
ter. In addition to showing you how much land you own, the survey
provides some assurance that all improvements are located withinthe legal boundaries and, more importantly, whether any of yourneighbors’ buildings encroach on your land.
The lender and title company will alert you to any discrepancies or
encroachments (where somebody else’s improvements sit on your
land). Discuss any issues with your broker or loan officer. Serious
problems have to be solved prior to closing.
Ask for a copy of the survey prior to the closing and inspect it
carefully to make sure you understand and approve the boundarylines. At closing, the title company or closing agent requires thatyou sign the survey certifying that you (the borrower) have seen itand received a copy.
You’ll be asked to sign a copy certifying that you know what you
are buying and what the lender is placing a lien on. If the surveyshows any encumbrances, the lender won’t close it until they’recleared up with a recordable easement or agreement with theother property owner(s). Many times you have “community drive-ways” that service several businesses, and a separate joint operat-ing agreement may be in place to maintain that service drive. Thelender will want to see a copy of that too.
Inspecting the title
Early in the process, the loan broker or lender orders a title 
commitment . This commitment provides a legal description of the
property, lists any liens against the property, and stipulates anyPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 16816_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 168terms or conditions associated with the commercial real estate
located there.
So, why should you care? This document is important because any
or all of this information can ultimately come back to haunt you. If,for example, other parties have a lien against the property, you maybe responsible for paying that lien if you take possession of theproperty. In addition, certain restrictions may limit improvements tothe property or how you can use the property to generate revenue.
Ask for a copy of the title commitment as early on as possible and
review it carefully. If any deed restrictions, operational limitations,or municipality conditions have been placed on the property, youneed to know about them prior to signing on the dotted line. Somelimitations can completely undermine your plans for the property.
Obtaining an engineering report
Engineering reports focus on the structural integrity of a building
and its proposed use. They may include stress load tests or evenearthquake tests for buildings in active fault zones. For one trans-action, I (Chip) had to obtain an engineering report on a concreteslab. The slab was eight feet thick and was supporting a massivesteel stamping machine in automotive production. That reportalone cost several thousand dollars.
Before you get too deep into a deal, find out which engineering
reports are going to be necessary and then obtain cost estimateson having them done. Lenders may require several of these reportsfor a single property depending on its location and proposed use.You can expect requests for more-detailed reports if you’re pur-chasing taller buildings or manufacturing facilities.
Get a copy of all reports and review them completely. These reports
may indicate a need for significant (and expensive) structuralrepairs that you need to make before you can use the property forthe desired purpose.
Getting a clean bill of 
environmental health
Gas stations, dry cleaners, and car washes are notorious for leeching
toxins into the ground on which they’re situated, so if you’re buying apiece of property that has (or had) one of these pollution-producerssitting on it, make sure you have it inspected (or at least purchaseenvironmental insurance to protect your investment). The last thingChapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 16916_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 169you want to inherit is a former brownfield site! (See the nearby sidebar
“What or where is Brownfield?” for more information.)
Most commercial transactions simply require environmental insur-
ance coverage similar to title insurance that protects the lender
against any past contaminations. Larger commercial properties
may have to provide a Phase I environmental report, which is a sur-
face level evaluation of the soil. This report costs anywhere from a
couple of hundred bucks to a couple of thousand.
If the Phase I report shows any contaminants, a Phase II is 
necessary — which costs even more. We can’t give you a ballparkestimate on the cost because it varies depending on the nature ofthe contaminants and the size of the parcel subject to the study.
If you have reason to suspect problems with the history of the site,
you can do a little of your own research on the government Website at 
www.epa.gov .
Navigating the Closing
After the lender receives and approves all the third-party reports,
it sends you a final commitment letter signaling the beginning ofthe end. This notification gives you and the lender the green lightto proceed to the closing table — the final chapter of the process(or at least the final section in this chapter).
Protecting yourself with 
title insurance
Every property has a title showing all the parties that have a legal
claim to the property. The list of parties obviously includes the cur-rent owners, but it can also include lenders from whom the ownersborrowed money, the government (which may lay claim to the prop-erty for any unpaid taxes), and utility companies (which may layclaim to the property for any unpaid utility bills).
Before you close on a real estate transaction, make sure you get 
title
insurance — protection against any financial loss resulting from an
overlooked valid legal claim to the property. Title insurance is even
more important when you’re closing on a commercial transactionbecause you usually have a lot more money on the line.
Prior to making an offer on the property, you should have received
a copy of the title commitment and taken care of any issues regard-ing unresolved property liens. Just prior to closing, however, askyour title company for an updated title commitment. Check for anyPart III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 17016_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 170new liens or changes based on the title underwriter’s most recent
research. Be especially careful about tax liens and utility liensbecause they transfer with ownership.
Make sure your closing addresses all liens listed on the title. If, for
example, the title shows that a mortgage lender still holds a lienagainst the property, make sure the closing is set up in such a waythat the balance of that loan is going to be paid from the proceedsof the sale. Go over the list of lien holders with your attorney andtitle company to be sure that everyone who’s supposed to get paidat closing does.
Have your attorney review the title documentation in addition to
the Warranty Deed prepared by the seller or the title escrow agent.Compare the legal descriptions line by line and word for word,point out any discrepancies (none of which is too small to correct),and have all issues resolved 
before closing.
Insuring your property
Prior to the closing, meet with your insurance agent to discuss the
nature of the property and its insurance requirements. Your lenderrequires that you have at least enough insurance to cover theamount of the new loan, but you need even more than that.
Make sure you have enough insurance to cover the replacement cost
of the building(s), including operational systems such as elevators,HVAC units, pools, laundry facilities, appliances, machinery, and soon. Also be sure to order enough liability insurance to cover you inthe event of personal injury claims and other lawsuits.Chapter 10: Securing a Loan to Finance Your Commercial Venture 171
What or where is Brownfield?
A brownfield site isn’t a specific place. It’s a term used to designate an abandoned
commercial or industrial facility situated on contaminated land or land generally
believed to be contaminated with pollution or hazardous wastes. In many cases,the owners face a situation in which it would cost them more to clean up the prop-erty than they would earn from the sale of the restored site, so they choose to leaveit as is.
People who buy brownfield sites (knowingly or unknowingly) also get stuck with the
cleanup bill. This situation is certainly okay as long as you know what you’re gettinginto and figure the cleanup costs into your budget. If you don’t make the necessarybudget accommodations, however, you may end up with a useless piece of propertyor expenses that completely wipe out your profit.16_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 171Have the policy ready to go prior to closing, and make sure it takes
effect on before the closing date and time. Most commercial poli-cies have an effective time, and you want that time to be theminute the closing takes place or before.
Attending to existing tenant rights
If you’re buying a rental property that already has tenants in it,
those tenants can make or break your ability to profit from the prop-erty. Prior to closing, you want to take inventory of your tenants,check on their status (especially in terms of paying their rent), andconnect with them to ensure a smooth transition from one landlordto the next. Here’s a checklist to help ensure a smooth transition:
/H12012At or just prior to the closing, ask the seller to execute a cer-
tification of tenancy. This information is your assurance that
you know of all tenants and the conditions of their tenancy.
/H12012For larger commercial properties, obtain an estoppel certifi-
cate from every tenant confirming their position with thecurrent owner.
(Your attorney can supply you with copies of
the certificate.) This certificate confirms all lease terms and
conditions (including monthly payment and security deposit)and the date on which they made their last payment. Usingthe estoppel certificate, you can identify tenants who arebehind on their rents and identify any early payments andsecurity deposits that the previous owner is holding, so youcan be sure that the money is transferred to you at closing.
/H12012Review all the rent rolls and have the seller certify them at
closing. Retain an original copy of the signed rent roll in case
you need it later if discrepancies arise.
/H12012Account for all security deposits that the seller still holds,
and make sure that the closing statement credits you forthem.
If they’re all held in an escrow account, make sure that
they’re transferred to you exclusively.
One of the first things you need to do as the new owner is communi-
cate with your tenants and set the tone for your relationship. If theproperty is a large commercial multifamily housing complex, youmay need to do it through a newsletter. For smaller properties, do itin person. Send a letter of introduction, and schedule an appoint-ment with each tenant. Don’t just show up on their doorstep.
With permission from the seller, I (Chip) usually try to meet each of
the tenants face to face prior to the closing. This process helps meget a better feel for the property and what I need to do to addressany tenant concerns right away. It also helps prevent tenant uneasi-ness that naturally arises when a new owner’s in town — althoughthe prospect of a new owner may be cause for celebration!Part III: Financing the Purchase of Commercial Properties 17216_422335-ch10.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 172Part IV

harder to pay back. Loans are short-term, and the lenders tend to
charge a high interest rate plus points (a percentage of the loan
amount) upfront. For the savvy real estate investor, though, access
to cash is often more important than the cost, so when credit istight, hard money may be the only option.
We begin this chapter by weighing the pros and cons of hard money
to determine whether it’s an option you want to pursue. We offer afew suggestions on how to keep the costs down and show you howto locate hard-money lenders in your market. We also show youhow to tap into other sources of hard cash by borrowing from rela-tives, taking out a line of credit against the investment property tocover repair and renovation expenses, and using your credit cardsas a last resort.18_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 175Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 176
Although we recommend the hard-money option for situations in
which a bank may turn you down for a loan, keep in mind thatbanks may turn you down for good reason — perhaps the invest-ment is far too risky for them. When banks turn you down, take acloser look at the numbers. Sometimes, a lost investment opportu-nity may be the best thing that never happened to you. 
Weighing the Pros and 
Cons of Hard Money
Before you decide to travel the hard-money route, consider the 
following potential benefits and drawbacks so you know whatyou’re getting yourself into.
Perusing the pros
Hard money is a high-interest, short-term loan that offers four big
benefits:
/H12012Easy access to cash: You can get your hands on cash you may
not be able to get through a conventional lender.
/H12012Reduced personal risk: You don’t have to borrow against your
own home and place it at risk because hard-money lenders
often accept the future value of a property as collateral, some-
thing of value they can take from you and sell if you happen to
default on the loan.
You can use your own house, possessions, and retirement sav-
ings as collateral, but doing so places your current posses-sions at risk and can get you into loads of trouble with yoursignificant other. A safer way to borrow money is through ahard-money lender who’s willing to accept just the investmentproperty as collateral.
Don’t give lenders an ownership position by naming them on
the deed, unless you truly want them as a partner. Give themonly a lien holder position in the mortgage document.
/H12012Flexibility in financing repairs and renovations: You can
often set up a separate escrow account with a hard-money
lender to pay for repairs and renovations.
/H12012No extra paperwork: You can get your hands on it fast —
without having to fill out a lot of extra formal paperwork.18_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 176Hard-money lenders are often more willing to negotiate with investors,
especially if you have a solid track record of profitable investmentsand paying back loans. Remember, these folks earn money fromthe risks you take on and the efforts you invest. As long as you’resuccessful, you can find people willing to invest in you.
Considering the cons
Now for the bad news. Hard money is called hard for several rea-
sons. Before choosing the hard-money option, be aware of the fol-
lowing key areas of hard-money loans:
/H12012Points or discount points: You can expect to pay anywhere
from two to six points or more for the loan upfront. See
“Calculating points” later in this chapter for details.
/H12012Interest rates: Hard-money lenders often charge nearly double
the interest rates of conventional loans. If the going interest
rate for conventional loans is 6.5 percent, for example, a hard-money lender may charge 10 to 15 percent. Because hard-Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 177
Hard money by any other name
Although we like the term hard money, others may use other terminology to refer to
this type of financing. Some of these terms apply to other types of financing, as well,
which can get a bit confusing, but don’t be surprised if your lender uses one of thefollowing terms to refer to the hard-money option: 
/H12012Bridge loan: Because the loan functions as a short-term bridge between not
owning the property and refinancing it later with a long-term loan.
/H12012Equity loan: Because you’re borrowing against the equity of the property you’re
purchasing rather than using your job and income as a way of securing the loan.
(Don’t confuse this with a standard home equity loan, in which you use financ-ing to pull equity out of a property you own. In this case, you’re essentiallypulling equity out of a home you don’t own so you can afford to buy it.)
/H12012Portfolio loan: Because the lender holds the mortgage instead of selling it on
Wall Street.
/H12012Rehab loan: Because you’re using the loan to purchase and renovate a dis-
tressed property to make it profitable, and the property doesn’t qualify for a reg-
ular loan due to its condition.
/H12012Private financing: Because individuals, rather than institutions, typically make
the loans available.18_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 177Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 178
money loans are typically short term, however, you’ll proba-
bly refinance or sell the property long before you rack up a lotof interest. See “Adding up the interest” later in this chapterfor details.
/H12012Loan-to-value (LTV): Hard-money lenders typically approve you
for a loan of only 65 to 75 percent of the property’s value, not
the typical 85 to 90 percent you can expect from conventionallenders. However, if you’re buying distressed property for wellbelow what the value of the property will be after it’s repaired,this drawback really shouldn’t matter. For example, if you’rebuying a property for 20 to 30 percent below what it will beworth after you fix it up, your hard-money loan should be ableto cover the full purchase price you’re paying. Still, you mayneed additional funds to cover holding and renovation costs.
When buying into a declining market, L TV becomes even more
critical because your loan amount stays the same while hous-ing values are declining. If the value of the house dips belowwhat you owe on it, you place yourself in a situation of owingmore on a property than what you can sell it for.
/H12012Amortization: Hard-money lenders often want to amortize the
loan over 5 to 15 years rather than the standard 30 years, which
ends up increasing your monthly payments because you’repaying down the principal on the loan faster. To lower themonthly payments, amortize over 30 years or negotiate forinterest-only payments. You want to have enough free-flowingcash to finance renovations and cover your holding costs.(See Chapter 6 for more about amortization.)
/H12012Balloon payment: Hard-money loans typically have balloon
payments or cash calls after so many months, so you may be
required to pay off the loan in full in a matter of 6 to 36 months.
This isn’t a problem as long as you have a solid plan in placeand sufficient funds on hand for when the balloon payment isdue. If you don’t, you may end up losing the property when youcan’t make the payments.
/H12012Prepayment penalties: Avoid any loans that stipulate a pre-
payment penalty — extra money you have to pay if you
choose to pay off the loan early — that remains in effect formore than the first couple years. We’ve seen investors losethousands of dollars when they sold a house because theyagreed to pay a 2 to 3 percent prepayment penalty.
/H12012Closing costs: As with any lender, you have to close on a loan
from a hard-money lender. Figure in the cost of the title insur-
ance, closing fee, credit report, and appraisal survey. Be par-ticularly careful of any discount points or loan origination fees —these are areas where the lender and mortgage broker can r eally
jack up the cost of the loan, so ask questions in advance.Refer to Chapter 6 for more about closing costs and fees.18_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 178/H12012Cross collateralization: If you’re investing in two or more prop-
erties, the hard-money lender may want to cross-collateralize
the properties. If you sell one property for a $10,000 profit, for
example, the lender may want to use the profit to pay down theloan on the other property. This route isn’t terrible — it mayeven benefit you by reducing your interest on the second loan — but it’s something you should be aware of. Cross collat-eralization simply secures the lender’s position.
Some hard-money lenders offer something called a 
bullet loan , in
which you make no monthly payments. Interest accrues and is
rolled back into the loan’s principal, which increases the totalamount required to pay off the loan and can significantly increasethe total amount of interest you end up paying. A bullet loan freesup your cash flow so you have more money on hand for renova-tions and other investment properties. However, it can also signifi-cantly increase your risks, especially if the market heads southwhen you’re scheduled to pay back the loan.
Managing the Expense of 
a Hard-Money Loan
Hard-money loans are notorious for costing a lot of money, but just
how much money is a lot? And can you do anything to limit theexpense? In the following sections, we answer these questions byshowing you how to calculate interest over the life of the loan, sub-tract the amount you save in taxes, and practice two strategies forslashing the amount you pay in interest.
Calculating points
A point is 1 percent of the loan amount, so if you’re paying six
points on a $200,000 loan, you’re paying $12,000 upfront to get your
mitts on the money. To calculate the total amount of money you’repaying in points, multiply the total loan amount by the totalnumber of points by 1 percent or .01:
Loan Amount 
×Number of Points ×.01 = $ Total Points
Some hard-money lenders may agree to refund a point or two if
you pay back the loan on time. If the lender is socking you with ahuge amount of interest in points, consider asking for a refund ifyou can pay back the loan on time or early. The sooner theinvestor can put that money back in play, the sooner she can col-lect points from the next borrower.Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 17918_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 179Adding up the interest
Calculating the total interest you can expect to pay over the life of
a loan is no different for hard-money loans than it is for conven-tional loans. To do so, just follow these steps:
1. Multiply the monthly payment by the number of months
you expect to be paying on the loan.
2. Add any balloon payments (or cash calls) you’re required
to make.
3. Subtract the total amount you borrowed.
The remainder is the interest you stand to pay through
your regular payments.
4. Add the total amount you paid upfront in points.
These can be discount points (interest paid upfront) or loan
origination points (fees). Technically, anything calculated as
a percentage of the loan is deductible as far as the IRS is
concerned. From a legal and regulatory perspective, origi-nation points and discount points differ even though theyfunction the same.
The resulting number is the total interest paid over the life of the loan.
Interest is only one expense you incur as the price of doing busi-
ness with a lender. The lender or broker who’s handling the trans-action may charge additional fees. When comparison-shopping forloans, even hard-money loans, don’t forget to account for theseexpenses. For details, refer to Chapter 6.
Subtracting the tax savings
When you’re calculating the cost of money into your equations,
think of your expenses as tax deductions. Keep in mind that you paytaxes only on your profits, so all expenses you incur — including theinterest you pay on loans — reduce your profits whether you sellthe property or rent it out.
This silver lining doesn’t mean you should rejoice in having to pay
a huge amount in interest and points, but it can alleviate some ofthe psychological pain you may feel. If, for example, you sell thehouse and have to pay 30 percent in short-term capital gains tax,the government is essentially covering 30 percent of the interestyou paid on your loan.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 18018_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 180Paying back the loan sooner 
to save money
Although hard-money loans have a reputation for costing the most
money, you can contain the costs by paying back the loan soonerrather than later. The following sections describe two ways toachieve this goal.
If you already paid most of your interest upfront in points, paying
back the loan in a hurry may not benefit you a great deal. Cash isstill king! If paying the loan back early means you don’t have thecash to pursue other deals, take your time.
Refinancing in a hurry
Conventional lenders tend to play it safe. As a result, they steer
clear of deals that they see as speculative. If you’re buying a run-down property in the hopes of renovating it and selling it for aprofit, they’re likely to deem the project as too risky. To move for-ward, you have to work through a hard-money lender or findfinancing elsewhere.
After you renovate the property, however, or after it’s generating
some rental income, the risks are likely to be minimal. At thispoint, conventional lenders are often more than willing to offer youfinancing because you’re in a better position to make paymentsand eventually pay back the loan.
Think of hard-money loans as short-term solutions. You pay a pre-
mium for gaining access to much-needed cash in a hurry. However,after you’ve established the property as a profitable venture, youdon’t have to continue paying astronomical interest rates. By refi-nancing through a conventional lender, you can often reduce yourmonthly payment and interest and improve your cash flow. In addi-tion, if you negotiated a refund for early payment with the hard-money lender, you can reduce your loan expenses even more.
Due to 
seasoning restrictions that most lenders have, though, plan
on holding the property for a full 12 months before refinancing. (A
seasoned loan is more attractive to lenders, because it shows thatthe borrower has made at least 12 payments on the loan and thatthe original lender was able to make some money for its trouble.)Conventional lenders may consider less time, but then you canobtain financing only for the original sales price plus repairs, asopposed to the actual new value, which should be greater.Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 18118_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 181Selling the property fast
Hard-money loans are often ideal for investors who flipproperties
(buy-fix-sell within a year or so). With a hard-money loan, assuming
everything goes as planned, you can purchase a property, renovateit, and sell it by the time you have to pay back the loan in full.
If you’re flipping properties, make sure you cover yourself by doing
the following:
/H12012Calculate the finance charges (including points) into your
expenses and always make sure you’re on track to earn aprofit of 20 percent or more.
This margin gives you a cushion
for unexpected expenses and cases in which the property 
sells for less than your target price. (Overestimate expenseswhile underestimating the sales price for additional protection.)
/H12012Have enough money on hand to cover the balloon payments
or cash calls. Many investors get into trouble when they have
to make a large payment while renovating the property and
trying to sell it. Plan ahead, so you don’t lose the propertybefore it starts to turn profitable.
/H12012Give yourself enough time to sell the property. If the renova-
tions are probably going to take you three months and
another three months to sell it, make sure you have enoughfunds to cover the holding costs for at least nine months —perhaps even longer in a slumping market.
/H12012Keep copies of all receipts, work orders, invoices and bids —
even for the smallest items. If a lender limits you to the origi-
nal purchase price plus repairs, you’re in a better position to
establish a higher value — and thus a higher loan amount.Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 182
Hard money isn’t always that hard
Hard-money lenders can be a real lifesaver when the right deal comes along. A few
years ago, I (Chip) was involved in a deal that required a facility to quickly be con-verted in order to comply with international contract requirements. The owner wouldreceive several million dollars within 60 days, but only if the property was converted.
A hard-money lender answered the call with $7 million in just 21 days, allowing the
owner to realize a net profit of more than $13 million. The loan cost more than$500,000 to put together, at an interest rate of 12 percent, but the cost was irrelevantwhen my client was netting that kind of money!
Although this tale is true, the profits don’t represent a typical real estate investment
deal. Earning $7 million in three weeks on a single deal isn’t something that mostreal estate investors, even the successful ones, ever experience.18_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 182Locating Local Hard-Money
Lenders
Walk down Main Street in any town or city and you can find at least a
few traditional lenders like banks or mortgage companies. What youdon’t see, however, is a hard-money lender. They’re not hiding in thealleys and cellars — they just do business in less-conspicuousplaces. You need to know where to look (and this section tells youjust that).
Asking your broker for leads
The most obvious and perhaps safest way to find hard-money
lenders is to ask your broker or loan officer. Many hard-moneylenders avoid the messiness of dealing directly with investors, sothey hire a loan officer or broker to manage the transactions. Yourbroker may have several clients who are hard-money lenders.
Working through your broker adds another level of protection,
ensuring you that the hard-money lender is legitimate. If you find ahard-money lender on your own, you need to rely solely on yourown judgment and that of any references you can dig up to deter-mine whether the lender is trustworthy. When you work throughyour broker, you have the benefit of an expert opinion on whetherthe lender is reputable.
In addition to asking your broker for leads, consider networking
with local accountants, CPAs, financial planners, or estate attor-neys. They often work with clients who are looking for good invest-ment opportunities, and many people prefer to invest locally,where they can keep an eye on things!
Networking through local 
investment groups
One of the best ways to track down any real estate professional,
including brokers and private lenders, is through a local real estate
investment group — organized individuals who meet regularly to
share information and advice about investing in real estate.
Networking in a local real estate investment group ensures thatyou’re dealing with people who have a proven record and an estab-lished reputation.Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 18318_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 183If you’re not a member of a local real estate investment group yet,
we strongly encourage you to find a group and start attendingmeetings. To find a group in your area, try visiting the NationalReal Estate Investors Association Web site at 
www.national
reia.com , click Find a REIA, and use the resulting map to track
down a local group.
Another way to find local groups is to ask your real estate agent,
broker, attorney, or other real estate professional. Most peoplewho work with real estate investors know which groups are themost active and reputable.
Perusing ads in local newspapers
Hard-money lenders often place ads in the local newspapers letting
people know that they loan money. The ad may include somethinglike the following:
Stop Foreclosure!
Real Estate LoansNo Credit RequiredQuick and Easy FinancingCall 1-800-555-5555
These ads may appear to be a little suspicious, but they’re the way
hard-money lenders often advertise their services.
Don’t hand over your personal information without performing
your own due diligence. Contact the lender and ask about the areahe lends in, the types of properties he specializes in, whether he’san individual or representing an investment group, and how manytransactions he’s done in the past year. Call the newspaper youfound the ad in and ask how long the person has been an adver-tiser and whether the paper has received any complaints. Ask forand check at least three references. Check search engines for thelender’s name and company name. Check with the Better BusinessBureau and your state’s attorney general to determine whetherthey have any complaints against the person on file.
Searching the Web
Many hard-money lenders advertise their services on the Web,
although they may not advertise as “hard-money lender.” Use yourfavorite Internet search tool (Google, Yahoo!, MSN, whatever) tosearch for the following:Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 18418_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 184/H12012Hard-money loan
/H12012Equity lender
/H12012Private lender or private investor
/H12012Real estate investment group
Follow your search phrase with the name of your state, county, or
city to focus on local lenders who do hard-money loans. By dealinglocally, you have a better chance of finding someone who has atrack record of dealing with investors in your community.
Getting preapproval
Conventional wisdom has it that you should make friends before
you need them. In the same way, line up hard-money lenders
before you need them, so you can act quickly when the best oppor-tunities come your way. The best way to do so is to obtain pre-approval for a set amount of funds by going through the screeningprocess before you have a loan application on the table. (Youshould already have a price range in mind for properties in themarket you want to target.)
Meet with and interview a few hard-money lenders before you
need a loan. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, some hard-money lenders have loan officers who handle the transactions forthem. Proceed through the preapproval process as explained ear-lier. Then, whether you need $50,000, $250,000, $1 million, or more,you know exactly what types of renovation projects you canpursue. As soon as you identify a prospective investment propertyin an approved price range, you can then move on it quickly, know-ing that you’re already approved for the money.
Hitting Up Friends and 
Relatives for a Loan
Charity should begin at home. (One thing we have in common is that
our grandmothers were our first and best investment partners.) Ifyou have a rich Uncle Jeb or Auntie Emily, or friends who have astash of cash they’re eager to invest (and you don’t mind calling insome favors), hit them up for the money. With family members, youmay be able to get a short-term, no- or low-interest loan, assumingyou’re not the family pariah. Friends may charge a little more or alittle less, but if they have the dough and you know what you’redoing, you can establish a mutually lucrative relationship.Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 18518_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 185In the following sections, we reveal the pros and cons of financing
investments through friends and relatives, offer advice on recog-nizing opportunities, cover the basics of drawing up agreements,and offer some words of wisdom to ensure that you don’t breakany securities laws when doing these deals.
Friends and family members are more likely than institutions (and
hard-money lenders) to become emotional about their money.
Grasping the pros and cons
Mixing business into relationships with family and friends can be a
risky proposition, particularly when your investments fall short ofexpectations. Handled properly with the right people, however,teaming up to invest in real estate can be one of the most reward-ing activities you can ever hope to experience. Before immersingyourself in the experience, be aware of the potential benefits andpitfalls, as laid out in the following sections.
Potential benefits
Scoring investment capital through friends and family members
delivers a host of potential benefits, including the following:
/H12012Access to cash you can’t get anywhere else
/H12012More attractive interest rates and low or no closing costs
(usually)
/H12012The joys of sharing a common goal and interest in your suc-
cess with those closest to you
/H12012Flexibility in negotiating the terms of the loan
/H12012Less pressure (sometimes) to pay the loan back precisely on
the agreed upon date
Potential pitfalls
Disagreements over finances trigger a lot of divorces, which says
something about mixing money and personal relationships. Beforeborrowing money from friends or family, consider the commonchallenges that often arise when you mix business with personalrelationships:
/H12012Disagreements over when the loan is to be repaid
/H12012Disagreements over the amount to be paid back (if you agreed
to pay interest)Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 18618_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 186/H12012Conflicts over how the investment is being managed — which
property to buy, how to renovate it, how to manage it (for arental property), or how to sell it (and for how much)
/H12012Bad feelings for a long time if an investment goes bad and
you’re unable to repay the loan on time or at all
For these reasons, make sure you have a written agreement thatclearly spells out the terms of the loan (see the “Drawing up anagreement” section later in this chapter).
Identifying the moneybags 
in your circle
One of the keys to avoiding the worst possible scenarios is to borrow
money only from those who can afford to lose it. If your kid brotherand your sister-in-law have a little nest egg set aside for a rainy day,hitting them up for a loan may not be the best option. It may straintheir relationship in addition to leaving them strapped for cash if oneof them is laid off or they experience some other crisis.
Instead, scope out the rich relatives in your circle, the friends and
family members who are cash heavy and are often looking for waysto invest their money that are often safer than Wall Street and prom-ise a better return than they can get on CDs at their local bank. Inaddition, given the recent craziness in both the housing market andthe stock market, family members may look more favorably on theoption of investing through a knowledgeable family member thanwith someone or some company they don’t know.
Drawing up an agreement
When it comes to borrowing money from family members and
friends, most strife arises not out of differences of opinion but outof misunderstandings. Perhaps you and your uncle discussed thedetails, and you each walked away 
thinking you understood the
agreement, but when it comes time to execute, you discover that
you really didn’t hash out the details or that one of you has forgot-ten a key clause you both agreed to.
For example, say you borrow money from your grandma with the
intent of just borrowing the money. Your idea is that your grandmais putting up the money, but you’re in charge of everything else.You head out, find a property you want to buy, and let grandmaknow that it’s time for her to deliver the cash. You head over toChapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 18718_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 187grandma’s, where you find her dressed to the nines and ready to
look at the property she’s buying.
The best way to avoid such uncomfortable scenarios is to draw up
a written agreement that covers the key details. Here are someitems your agreement should address:
/H12012Amount of money (range) that your friend or relative is willing
and able to invest.
/H12012Whether the cash can be used for the purchase of the prop-
erty, renovations, or both.
/H12012The amount of time you have to pay back the loan.
/H12012The amount of interest (if any) or the percentage of the profit
(if any) your friend or family member will be entitled to.
/H12012Who’s in charge of making decisions on which property to
buy, the purchase price, which renovations to perform, howmuch to pay for renovations, whether to rent or sell the prop-erty, and so on. (You should try to retain as much control aspossible.)
/H12012How you will proceed if the investment fails. How will the prop-
erty be liquidated, and how are you going to share the loss?
/H12012How and how much information you plan on sharing. Are you
going to share all the financial figures with your investor(s)?Will you provide them with written reports, and if so, how often?
/H12012How you will resolve any disputes. Can you name an unbiased
intermediary?
Enlist the assistance of a qualified attorney in drawing up an agree-ment that protects everyone’s interests. One form that such a“contract” can take is a pro forma agreement. You can download aboilerplate of such an agreement at 
www.themortgagemyths.com .
Keep in mind, however, that laws vary among states, so you’re best
served by consulting an attorney.
So, what do you do if you live in Florida, are going into business
with your grandma who lives in Arizona, and are buying propertyin Georgia? In most cases, the court of jurisdiction is the state inwhich the property is located, so make sure you have an attorneylicensed to practice in that state prepare the documents for you.Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 18818_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 188Honoring securities laws
When soliciting money from private investors, be careful not to
break any securities laws (rules and regulations that govern partial
ownership in a business venture). If you’re hitting up your
grandma or Uncle Fred for a loan, you should be in the clear, but ifyou pass the hat among private investors, post an ad in the localpaper or on the Internet, or try to get a group of lenders to pooltheir resources to finance your projects, you may have to belicensed, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maycategorize these solicitations as a 
public offering — sort of like sell-
ing stock in a corporation rather than a simple loan transaction.
State regulators may also join the party, and it won’t be a fun one.
If you plan on soliciting funds from multiple individuals, strangers,
or the public at large, consult an attorney who’s familiar with secu-rities regulations first to make sure you handle the transactionsproperly.
Financing Fix-Ups with a Home
Equity Loan or Line of Credit
A hard-money loan can often cover the purchase price, but it may
not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairs and renovations. Ifthe property is valued at significantly more than what you paid forit, however, you can often take out another loan to pay for repairsand renovations — a 
home equity loan orhome equity line of credit
(HELOC, or LOC for short).
In the following sections, we cover the basics of home equity loans
and lines of credit, encourage you to max out your LOC, and showyou how to apply for an LOC.
Although we cover both home equity loans and lines of credit, for
the purposes of financing repairs and renovations, an LOC isalmost always the preferred tool. With an LOC, you pay interestonly on the money you actually use. With a home equity loan, youpay interest on the total amount you borrow whether you use themoney or have it sitting in a bank account.Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 18918_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 189Understanding home equity 
loans and LOCs
A home equity loan or line of credit unlocks the equity in your
home without affecting your current mortgage:
/H12012A home equity loan provides you with a single chunk of money —
a one-time payment to you. Lenders may choose not to charge
closing costs on home equity loans. Some banks even pay for thecredit report and appraisal. (When credit is tight, as it wasduring the writing of this book, lenders are likely to waive closingcosts only for borrowers with the absolute best credit scores.)
/H12012A home equity line of credit enables you to borrow only what
you need and pay interest on only what you borrow, making
this option attractive for financing renovations. It’s sort of likethe line of credit you get with a credit card, but with a lowerinterest rate (usually).
Home equity loans and lines of credit often come with adjustableinterest rates, which carry additional risks, as we explain inChapter 5. The good news is the interest on home equity loans and
lines of credit qualifies as mortgage interest, so it’s tax deductible.
Maxing out your LOC
When applying for an LOC, don’t be shy about asking for the maxi-
mum amount you can borrow against the property. You pay inter-est only on the amount you use, so you’re not penalized for maxingout your LOC.
However, just because you have $50,000 available for repairs and ren-
ovations doesn’t mean you should use every penny of it. Stick toyour budget so you have a better chance of hitting your profit target.
Keep in mind that your ability to “max out” your LOC can change
depending on what’s going on in the marketplace. When housingvalues are soaring, lenders are often willing to let you cash outevery penny of equity in a property. Some lenders even allow youto borrow equity in excess of what the property has in it. However,when property values take a dive, lenders are often stung by theseloose lending practices and may significantly restrict the amountof equity you can cash out.Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 19018_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 190Applying for an LOC
Applying for an LOC is very similar to the application process for a
conventional loan, as explained in Chapter 7. You need to fill out aloan application and supply the loan officer with supporting docu-mentation, including copies of your most recent federal income taxreturns, 30 days’ worth of pay stubs, and a list of assets and liabilities.
In addition, the lender typically requires an appraisal to ensure
that the estimated equity in the property is accurate. With a homeequity line of credit, the home’s equity (market value minus whatyou currently owe on the property) serves as the collateral tosecure the loan.
Supplementing Your Financing
with Credit Cards
Many families are over their heads in high-interest credit card
debt, so it may seem a little strange that we would even considersuggesting the possibility of using a credit card account to financereal estate investments. Who in their right mind would want to pay18 percent or more in credit card interest when they could get anLOC for less than 10 percent?
We’re not suggesting that you max out your credit cards to pur-
chase property, but credit cards can give you quick access to cashfor repairs, renovations, and unexpected expenses.
This section looks at advantages to using your credit cards, helps
you decide which cards to use, and explains the importance ofstaying current with your payments.
Eyeing the pros to credit card use
Using a credit card to supplement your financing is an easy way to
get your hands on cash fast. Consider some of the advantages thatcredit card financing offers:
/H12012Most credit cards enable you to take cash advances, no ques-
tions asked. (Some companies send you checks to make iteven easier.)
/H12012You can usually get hold of some cash within 24 hours.Chapter 11: Financing in a Pinch 19118_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 191/H12012Credit card debt is unsecured . In other words, you put up no
collateral to secure the credit, so the credit card company
can’t seize your property in lieu of payment if you happen todefault on the “loan.”
/H12012The credit card company doesn’t charge closing costs. You
probably have to pay a substantial amount in transaction feesand interest, but if you use the money short-term, it can beless than you’d pay a hard-money lender. Do the math.
Keep the credit card option off the table until you 
really need it in a
pinch. If you play the card too early, you may not have the option
when you really need it. In addition, keeping your personalfinances separate from your business (investing) finances can sig-nificantly reduce your exposure to risk. We advise using a creditcard only as a last resort.
Choosing a credit card with low
interest and plenty of perks
Credit cards aren’t all created equal. Some companies charge lower
interest, others offer perks — frequent flyer miles, free groceries ormerchandise, cash back on purchases, and so on. Shop around forcredit cards that have the lowest interest rates and the most perks.Be sure to read the fine print so you’re not just comparing 
introduc-
tory rates . The fine print tells you what the rate jumps to after the
introductory period expires.
You can comparison-shop for credit cards online at www.credit
cardguide.com . If you have some major renovations lined up, con-
sider applying for a credit card at your building supply store. Many
of these stores offer a discount on your entire purchase the firsttime you apply for and use the card. If you order $5,000 in materi-als and receive a 10 percent discount, that’s $500 you save in reno-vation expenses.
Check your monthly statement to determine your credit limit and
stay within that limit. Also, pay off the balance as soon as possible.We know people who charge everything on their credit card —their phone bill, electric bill, groceries, gas, auto maintenance, cloth-ing, cable bill, and so on — and then pay the balance as soon as thebill arrives. They collect the perks (often something like 1 to 2 per-cent cash back on merchandise) without paying a penny in interest!Part V: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 19218_422335-ch11.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 192Chapter 12
Capitalizing on Seller
Financing
In This Chapter
/H17075Securing seller financing through a land contract
/H17075Leasing a property with the option to buy
/H17075Protecting your investment from the forfeiture clause
When most people think about purchasing a home they can’t
afford to pay cash for, the only option they consider is bor-
rowing the money from a bank. They automatically assume thatthe seller wants cash at the closing table.
Highly motivated sellers, however, may be willing and perhaps
even eager to sell you the home on contract and finance the pur-chase themselves. Doing so enables them to profit in two ways:
/H12012By selling you the property for a profit
/H12012By collecting interest as a part of the financing agreement
Financing the purchase is a pretty secure investment for the seller.
It allows them to place their cash in an investment vehicle thatthey are very familiar with — as opposed to investing it with thosefriendly folks on Wall Street.
In this chapter, we reveal two ways you can purchase a property
on contract with seller financing: by using a land contract (or con-tract for deed) or a lease option (rent-to-own) agreement.
Buying Property on Contract 
with a Land Contract
With a land contract (also called a contract for deed or installment
sales contract ), you buy the property directly from the owner/seller,19_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 193just as you always do, but you also finance the purchase through
the seller. The seller becomes the bank, but instead of using a mort-gage to secure the loan, you sign a land contract stipulating theterms of the transaction.
The legal language in a land contract is very similar to what you
find in a mortgage, but you don’t actually take title to the property.You instead have what is called 
equitable interest, which basically
means that you own the property as long as you honor your part
of the contract (including making payments on time) .The land
contract stipulates the interest rate, contract length, and the amor-
tization method. (Refer to Chapter 6 for more on amortization.) Foryou, as the buyer/investor, the arrangement differs very little fromwhat you may expect working through a bank. The seller is forgo-ing a lump sum payment in exchange for regular income and mayqualify for some tax advantages as a result.
In the following sections, we unveil the potential benefits and
drawbacks of buying properties on contract, show you how to pro-tect yourself by inspecting the title first and avoiding the due-on-sale-clause trap, and walk you through the process of buying aproperty on contract.
The ups and downs of buying 
a property on contract
Purchasing a property and financing the purchase through the
seller appeals to the entrepreneur in everyone. It cuts out the mid-dleman (the bank) and cuts to the chase, reducing fees and has-sles. It’s a model of free-market, freewheeling economy at work.Buying on contract, however, is also riddled with risks. In the fol-lowing sections, we explore the pros and cons of this path so youcan make a well-informed decision as to whether buying on con-tract is right for you.
The pros of using a land contract
Purchasing properties through a land contract rather than financ-
ing the purchase through a bank offers several advantages forinvestors, including the following:
/H12012The seller may provide financing when a bank won’t.
/H12012You save on closing costs.
/H12012The seller may offer lower monthly payments than a bank
would charge you.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 19419_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 194/H12012The seller may also agree to a low- or no-down-payment deal,
assuming you have outstanding credit.
/H12012You may not have to jump through so many hoops to prove
that you’re creditworthy.
/H12012The seller may be more flexible if you’re late with a payment
or two (but don’t count on it).
The cons of using a land contract
Purchasing a property on contract seems to be the ideal scenario.
You purchase and finance the purchase through a single entity (theseller) and avoid all the red tape and hassles that large institutionsuse to trip you up. However, the land contract does come with itsshare of potential drawbacks, including the following:
/H12012You don’t have a bank covering your back. By having an 
attorney and title company in your corner, however, you can gain the protection you need.
/H12012The seller may require a larger down payment or charge
higher interest.
/H12012Most contracts have a forfeiture clause stating that you give up
your rights to the property if you fail to honor the contract. See“Beware of the Forfeiture Clause” later in this chapter for details.
/H12012You increase your chances of becoming a victim of fraud. If, for
example, you fail to record the land contract at the register ofdeeds, the seller (listed as the official owner) can borrowagainst the property and try to stick you with the debt.
/H12012When the time comes to refinance or sell, you and the seller
may have disagreements over the balance.
/H12012If the sellers fail to pay their obligations or end up in bank-
ruptcy court, you may end up having to defend your interestsin court.
Inspecting the title
Before you even consider financing the purchase through the
seller, do your homework to make sure the owner/seller is therightful (and sole) owner of the property and has no undisclosedliens against the property. In order to do your preliminary titleresearch, you can head down to your county’s register of deedsoffice and ask the clerk for whatever info is recorded on a particu-lar property’s title. At the bare minimum, obtain a copy of the deedand any other recorded documents for the current and previousChapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 19519_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 195owner. If possible, obtain copies of all documents recorded in the
past 24 months.
Inspect the title work and deed for the following crucial pieces of data:
/H12012Mortgagor (homeowners’) names: Note whether the mort-
gagor’s name matches the name actually listed as the prop-
erty’s title holder. Differing names raise a red flag — make anote of any discrepancy.
/H12012Price and previous price paid for the property: This info can
help you estimate the property’s current value.
/H12012Warranty deed names: The names on the deed should match
the homeowners’ names on the title. If they don’t match, the
difference raises a red flag; make note of it.
/H12012Previous mortgagor: Check the previous title and jot down
the names on the title. Note any chinks in the chain of title
(series of owners). For instance, say your title work shows
that Johnson sold the property to Davis and then Howard soldit to Pinkerton. But whom did Davis sell the house to, andwhom did Howard buy it from? This gap indicates a problemin the chain of title; consult your title company whenever younotice any irregularities in this chain.
/H12012Mortgages or liens: Make sure the owner/seller owns the
property outright. If you see any liens against the property,
you want to make sure the seller pays off the lien holders
before you sign the contract.
/H12012Property tax liens: Check with the county tax assessor’s
office for recent tax bills that are due and owing, or even pre-
vious years’ taxes that haven’t been paid, which may havebeen transferred to the state. Any tax liens trump your rights!
If you notice any discrepancies in the chain of title or any other redflags, ask the register of deeds about it, consult your title company,and bring up the issue with the current owner. If the answers don’tsatisfy you, don’t do the deal.
Although you can do this research yourself (and you really should
do it yourself to learn about title research), we recommend that asa beginner you consult your title company for a second opinion andorder a 
title commitment (a preliminary report). After you feel com-
fortable doing your own research, you can take on more of the
burden.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 19619_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 196Beware of the due on sale clause
If you have documented proof that the owner/seller owns the prop-
erty free and clear, you can skip this section. If the seller has amortgage, however, that mortgage almost certainly has a due onsale clause that may cause significant trouble if you move forwardwith the deal. A 
due on sale clause states that if the owners sell or
transfer equitable ownership in the property, they must immedi-
ately pay off the remaining balance on the loan in full.
Here’s how that little clause can affect you: Say the seller has a mort-
gage on the property and sells it to you. As soon as you completethe transaction, you head down to the register of deeds office torecord the contract; this act protects your rights to the property byrecording your name as the new owner. However, the fact that theproperty has changed hands is now public knowledge, and if thebank finds out, it can call in the loan. Now the seller has to come upwith the money to pay the total balance remaining on that loan,which means he’ll probably try to squeeze the money out of you.
Of course, you may be able to get away with not recording the 
contract, but this clever ruse can expose you to even greater risk:
/H12012If the lender finds out, it can pursue legal action against you
for conspiring to commit fraud. And the lender always finds
out through the change in the insurance coverage.
/H12012If you’re dealing with an unscrupulous seller, the seller can
load up the property with other liens and mortgages.Remember, until you record the contract, the seller is still theofficial property owner and can borrow against it.
Almost every nongovernmental mortgage contains a due on saleclause. No matter how much you want a certain property, don’t everconsider trying to sneak a seller-financed deal through without noti-fying the bank. Otherwise, you put yourself in great financial peril.
The how-to: What you need to do
Buying a property on contract doesn’t require any more effort or
expertise on your part than financing through a bank. It does, how-ever, require that you have the wisdom to have a qualified realestate attorney examine the contract before you sign it. If the sellerwasn’t originally planning to sell the property on contract, youmay even be able to have your attorney prepare the paperwork.Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 19719_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 197If you’re looking for a step-by-step guide on how to buy a property
on contract, here’s a general breakdown of the steps:
1. Find a property that interests you.
If you use a real estate agent to help you identify poten-
tially lucrative investment opportunities, try to choose anagent who understands these creative financing deals andcan explain how they work to prospective sellers.
If the property has been on the market for several months,
the seller may be more motivated than usual to finance thepurchase. Don’t just look for listings that advertise sellerfinancing — find the property first and then pitch youroffer to the seller.
2. Research the property carefully to be fairly certain that
you’re investing in a profitable property.
Check out Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition,
by Eric Tyson and Robert S. Griswold (Wiley) for informa-
tion on researching your market and specific properties.
3. Pitch a reasonable offer.
Because you’re going to be asking the seller to finance the
deal, don’t try to lowball the seller too much on the purchaseprice (but make sure you’re not overpaying and can still earnthe desired profit). Explain that although you can afford tomake the payments, you don’t meet the bank’s stringentrequirements and need seller financing to do the deal.
4. Ask your agent or attorney to write up your offer.
Make sure the offer specifies your down payment, the inter-
est rate you’re willing to pay, and the monthly paymentsand any other lump-sum payments you make over the lifeof the loan. Here are some additional tips:
• Offer a low down payment to maximize your cash flow.
• Offer a higher interest rate than the seller is likely to
get by keeping the money in a savings account or CD.
• Specify the date on which you agree to pay the loan
back in full — typically in three to five years. (You
should have plans to sell the property or refinancewith a conventional loan by then.)
5. Hire a title company or real estate agent to manage the
closing to ensure that all the i’sare dotted and the t’sare
crossed and that all the paperwork is properly recorded
with the register of deeds.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 19819_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 198Before you sign the contract, obtain a formal title insurance
policy. This protects you just in case someone shows uplater claiming rights to the property. 
Never buy a property
without buying title insurance for it.
Protecting yourself against fraud
By carefully researching the properties that interest you (particu-
larly the legal documents associated with them), you protect your-self not only from inadvertent errors but also from con artists whoare trying to fleece you. Con artists often file false or doctored docu-ments as part of their scams. Sometimes, they can even sell a housethey don’t own or sell a house several times to different buyers.
To protect yourself from falling victim to a real estate scam, take
the following precautions:
/H12012Check the records to see whether the mortgage on the prop-
erty was recently paid off. Sellers rarely pay off mortgages
right before they sell, so any document that shows the mort-
gage as having been recently paid off should make you morecautious.
/H12012Be wary of an investor pitching you an unbelievably great
deal on a property. Con artists often target novice investors
in double-sales scams and often offer incredibly great deals so
they can find buyers in a hurry.
/H12012Analyze the title commitment for suspicious transactions. If
the title shows that the property’s been sold several times
over a short period, for example, the property may beinvolved in an illegal flipping scheme. Make sure the title com-mitment covers the past 24-month history of the property,including mortgages.
/H12012Purchase title insurance as soon as possible and pay for it
upfront. Sometimes, title insurance is your only protection
against fraudulent activity that’s impossible to detect prior to
purchasing a property.
Renting to Own with a Lease
Option Agreement
A lease option agreement is essentially a rent-to-own deal. You agree
to pay rent for a fixed period, after which you have the option (but
aren’t required) to buy the property. Normally the sellers charge Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 19919_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 1995 to 10 percent upfront and treat it as a down payment, deducting it
from the purchase price. You pay monthly rent of about 1 percentof the purchase price.
For example, if you have a lease option agreement on a $200,000
house, you can expect to pay $10,000 to $20,000 down and $2,000per month. A portion of the monthly payment usually goes towardthe principal. At the end of the lease term, if you choose to pur-chase the property, you pay the remaining balance due on the pur-chase price you agreed to pay.
A lease option agreement can be a great financing solution, assum-
ing you’re working with trustworthy seller and you can secure thefunds needed to purchase the property by the time your option tobuy rolls around. If you don’t have the money ready when the timecomes to exercise your option, you may forfeit the deal and end uplosing your down payment and any interest you paid in monthlypayments (depending on how the agreement is worded).
As suggested by its name, the lease option agreement consists of
two parts:
/H12012The lease part: In the lease part, the seller and the buyer (you)
have a landlord-tenant relationship. The seller agrees to let
you live in the property for a certain period as long as you paythe rent and don’t trash the joint.
/H12012The option part: The option part covers the terms of the sale.
In the following sections, we highlight the important areas of each
part to steer you clear of the most common pitfalls.
You may be wondering whether you should proceed with repairs
and renovations prior to exercising your option to purchase. Ifyou’re certain that you’re going to exercise your option, feel free tobegin working on the property. The seller will like to see you improv-ing the property, because it demonstrates your commitment to thedeal. However, contracts usually require the seller to preapprove allrepairs, additions, and renovations. If you’re not sure you’re going toexercise your option, you may want to avoid moving forward withany extensive renovations — recovering your investment later canbecome problematic or even impossible.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 20019_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 200Grasping the fundamentals of 
a lease option agreement
A lease option agreement is a legal document. As a result, it’s usu-
ally packed with legal language that you need an attorney to decipher. As an investor, however, you should understand the keypoints of the agreement:
/H12012You have the option to buy, but you don’t have to do so. If
you have a lease option to buy a $200,000 home and its
market value drops to $150,000 when you have the option tobuy, you would probably be wise not to exercise your option(or at least renegotiate the price).
/H12012In addition to a down payment, the seller usually requires
you to pay a fee for the option to buy. This fee is usually non-
refundable.
/H12012Although you can agree at signing to pay market value
when your option to buy rolls around, you usually want tolock in a price from the get-go.
You especially want to lock
the price if you expect property values to rise, so when you
exercise your option, you’re paying a lower than currentmarket price.
/H12012In most cases, you lease the property for one to three years
for a set rental amount. The part of your monthly rent above
the market rate is usually applied toward the purchase price,
essentially paying down the principal.
/H12012During the lease period, the seller can’t sell the property to
anyone else. As a result, you tie up the property, so nobody
else has a chance to buy it.
/H12012In most cases, you need the seller’s approval to assign the
lease option to someone else. In other words, you can’t just
lease the property to anyone of your choosing. The seller has
a say in your selection of tenants.
/H12012If you don’t exercise your option to buy, it expires. At that
point, the seller can sell the property to someone else, and
you lose any deposit and additional rent credits you’ve paid.Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 20119_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 201Using the lease to earn some cash
The lease portion of the agreement stipulates the rental agreement
between you and the seller. It typically covers the length of thelease, your monthly payment, the portion of the payment that goestoward the purchase price, the condition in which you must main-tain the property, whether or not you can have pets, and whetheryou can sublease the property to other tenants. You may be able touse the lease agreement to your advantage if you’re looking tomake some extra cash.
Read the lease carefully to ensure that you can honor what it stipu-
lates and that it contains no language that the seller can easily useto prove that you broke the contract. In the following sections, wepoint out the two key areas to focus on.
Ensuring you can sublease the property
Most people who buy homes by using lease option agreements are
people who use those homes as their primary residences. Duringthe lease period, they live in the home. As an investor, however,you probably already have a place you call home, so living in theproperty isn’t really a choice. Leaving the property vacant reallyisn’t a choice either, so you probably want to sublet the propertyuntil you eventually take ownership of it.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 202
Lease options: Win-win deals
A lease option deal can be a win-win situation for both the buyer and the seller. The
buyer can lock in the purchase price of a home in an area where home values areon the rise. For example, if you have a lease option to buy a $250,000 property overthe course of 24 months, and the home increases in value by 10 percent over thattwo-year period, you have $25,000 of equity built up in the house that can help youobtain a conventional loan to purchase the property or that you can use as a downpayment on the property when your option to buy the house arrives.
The seller benefits by getting tenants (potentially buyers) who treat the house with
tender loving care because they’re planning on eventually owning it.
The seller has less property maintenance to perform, usually collects a nonrefund-
able option fee upfront (with a deferred tax, meaning taxes won’t be due on theoption fee until the sale is finalized), has a steady cash flow from the monthly rent,and has a buyer lined up to purchase the property when the lease option termexpires. In addition, instead of paying short-term capital gains on profits from thesale of the property, the seller can hold the property in excess of a year, so the prof-its qualify for the much lower long-term capital gains tax rate.19_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 202When examining the agreement, make sure it includes a clause
stating that you have the right to sublet the property. Otherwise,you may get stuck paying holding costs for a property that’s notgenerating any revenue for you, which is never a good situation.
When you find someone interested in renting the property, make
sure the agreement you settle on with the renters fits your invest-ment strategy. If you want to sublet the property for two years, paythe balance due on the purchase price, and sell the property, besure the rental agreement clearly spells out when the lease ends.You also need to ensure that the other terms of your lease areincorporated into the sublease, or you risk violating the leaseoption agreement.
Assigning the lease to another party
Another way you can profit from the property is by selling your
interest in the contract. A lease option agreement contains valuethat may be of interest to another party if you later decide not toexercise your option. Your lease option agreement should give youthe right to assign the lease to another party, essentially allowingthem to step into your position and exercise the option later.
I (Chip) once located a $300,000 property that had been on the
market for quite some time. I negotiated a $3,000 lease option andthen subleased it as an investment property. I negotiated a two-month delay on the initial payment and used the security depositand first month’s rent to pay for the option. I made a couple ofquick fixes on the property, created a nice cash flow, and ended upselling my interest in the lease option to another investor for$7,000. So after putting in about five hours on the deal and somecosmetic touch-ups, I made a $4,000 profit in two months withouttaking title to the property, and using none of my own money.
Dealing with the option
The more interesting part of the lease option agreement is the
option to buy — your prerogative, at the end of the lease period, topurchase the property . . . or not. When the time finally arrives,you should actually have three options:
/H12012Exercise your option. In other words, buy the property for the
agreed-upon price.
/H12012Choose not to exercise your option, in which case the
prospective seller keeps the property, whatever you paid forthe option, whatever lease payments you made, and perhapseven the down payment and interest.
/H12012Sell your option to another party.Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 20319_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 203You may actually have one more alternative — you may be able to
choose not to exercise your option and then negotiate the pur-chase for a lower price, assuming property values have dropped oryou believe that the sellers need to sell in a hurry.
In the following sections, we discuss your option options in greater
detail.
Exercising your option
Assuming you signed a lease option agreement with the intention
of ultimately purchasing the property and that housing valueshaven’t dropped since you agreed to the deal, you probably wantto exercise your option before it expires.
Your lease option agreement should lay out exactly what you need
to do to exercise your option to buy the property. Here’s a sampleof how the option clause is likely to appear:
To exercise the option to purchase, the buyer/tenant mustdeliver to the seller/landlord written notice of the intent to pur-chase. The notice must specify a valid closing date precedingthe expiration date of the lease agreement or the date of theexpiration of the option to purchase, whichever occurs later.
Follow the instructions to the letter. If the agreement says that youneed to deliver your written notice dressed as Little Bo Peep,deliver the notice dressed accordingly. Any discrepancy can causeyou to forfeit your option to purchase and result in the loss of theproperty and any money you’ve sunk into it.
Not exercising your option
You may choose not to exercise your option for any of several 
reasons — a downturn in the market that makes the propertyworth much less than you agreed to pay for it, financial woes thatmake you unable to afford the property, an inability to obtain thefinancing you need by the option deadline, and so on.
Not exercising your option is easy — you do nothing other than
move out or make sure any tenants you subleased to vacate theproperty. You also need to make sure the property is in the condi-tion you agreed to leave it in. Other than that, you simply walk away.
As a courtesy to the seller/landlord, provide sufficient notice that
you plan on not exercising your option. Thirty days or more is best.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 20419_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 204Selling your option
As long as the agreement doesn’t contain an exclusivity clause (as
discussed in the following text), you can assign the option to buythe property to another party — essentially selling your interest in the property.
A simple assignment agreement is all that’s necessary, with a simul-
taneous notification of assignment letter to the seller. Your attorneycan supply you with the agreement and letter of notification.
Typically, the lease option contract contains a 
notification clause
that requires you to let the seller know your intentions at least 90
days before the option expires. No matter what you decide, yousend the seller a certified letter (return receipt requested) to protect your rights.
If you decide to assign your option to buy, consult your attorney to
prepare the necessary documents. 
When you purchase an option to buy a property, avoid signing a
lease option agreement that contains an 
exclusivity clause like the
following (unless you’re absolutely certain that you’re not going to
want to sell your option):
The option to purchase is exclusive and nonassignable and existssolely for the benefit of the named parties above. If the buyer/tenant attempts to assign, convey, delegate, or transfer thisoption to purchase without the seller/landlord’s express writtenpermission, any such attempt shall be deemed null and void.
The sellers/landlords are likely to want this language in the con-tract to protect themselves in the event that you try to sell theoption to someone who’s less likely to secure financing to executethe option. Your choice to sell the option, however, doesn’t reallyaffect the position of the sellers/landlords — it’s just another wayyou’ve chosen to exercise your option.Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Seller Financing 20519_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 205Paying Close Attention to 
the Forfeiture Clause
Lease option agreements all contain a forfeiture or default clause
stating exactly what happens in the event that the buyer/tenant
chooses not to exercise the option or fails to comply with otherterms stated in the agreement. The clause usually appears some-thing like the following:
If buyer/tenant defaults under this agreement, then seller/landlord may terminate the option to purchase through writtennotice of the termination. If the agreement is terminated, thebuyer/tenant shall lose entitlement to any refund of rent oroption payment.
The forfeiture clause itself is necessary and fairly innocuous. Afterall, if you break the contract, you should pay some sort of penalty.What’s potentially dangerous is everything else in the contract, sobe sure to read the agreement thoroughly to make sure that youwon’t have any trouble complying.
Some con artists have used the lease option agreement as a way to
scam home buyers and investors out of money. They word theagreement in a way that makes it nearly impossible for the buyerto honor it. Their goal is to collect as much money upfront andthrough monthly payments as possible and then repossess theproperty on the grounds that the buyer broke the contract.
To protect yourself, make payments through an insured third-party
servicing company (commonly called an 
escrow company ). Doing
so makes the accounting fair and complete for both parties and
helps avoid disputes when the time comes to pay off the contractor exercise the option. Many banks also provide this service.
Make sure that you make all payments by check or electronic
funds transfer to avoid any question about the dates or amounts ofpayments, and make sure that the insurance policy names you asan “insured party” to protect your interests in case of loss.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 20619_422335-ch12.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 206Chapter 13
Partnering to Share the 
Risk and the Equity
In This Chapter

/H17075Deciding whether to take on a partner
/H17075Teaming up with the right person
/H17075Drafting a partnership agreement
/H17075Steering clear of common partnership woes
To succeed as an investor, you need time, know-how, and cash
or credit. If you have the time and the know-how, you can often
find someone who has the cash or the credit to finance the dealand perhaps even share responsibilities and workload. Partnershipsand joint ventures enable you to do just that — enlist the assistanceof others to obtain financing and share costs, workload, and profits.
In this chapter, we explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of
partnerships and joint ventures and then show you how to struc-ture such deals in a way that is mutually beneficial for you andyour partner.
Talent trumps money. As an investor with the skills to transform
money into more money, you’re at least as valuable as the personputting up the money. Don’t sell yourself short — financiers needyour talents at least as much as you need their money.
Differentiating between a
Partnership and a Joint Venture
In your search for cash and credit, you may turn to a partnership
or joint venture arrangement. These two options offer you greatopportunities for raising some quick cash and credit. Before we dig20_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 207deeper into the nitty-gritty of these two arrangements in this chap-
ter, you first need to make sure you can recognize the differencebetween a bona fide partnership and a joint venture:
/H12012A partnership is an agreement between two or more individu-
als to pool their skills, knowledge, experience, and resources
for a common undertaking and share potential profits andlosses on any and all activities they choose to engage in. Fortax purposes, profits pass through the partnership to the indi-viduals, but the partnership still has to submit a tax return.
Partnerships are primarily useful for business ventures that
involve the joint holding of assets that appreciate, such asreal estate or businesses. If you want to remain the sole ownerof your assets, a formal partnership isn’t for you. Exploreother sources for financing, such as hard money lenders, asdiscussed in Chapter 11.
/H12012A joint venture is an agreement between two or more individu-
als to team up on a single enterprise, such as a particular real
estate investment. With a joint venture, the IRS doesn’trequire that the venture file a separate tax return.
Although partnerships and joint ventures differ in legal terms andcomplexity, in this chapter, we treat them both under the umbrellaof partnerships, because they both involve two or more partiesworking together on investment properties.
Whether you’re involved in a partnership or a joint venture, you
share liability with your partners. To provide you and your part-ners some protection against potential lawsuits, consider forminga limited liability company (LLC), as discussed in Chapter 2, andprocessing all transactions through the LLC.
Weighing the Pros and 
Cons of Partnerships
Partnerships, like marriages, can be good or bad, productive or
destructive. A great partnership can enable you to do more andprofit more than you and your partner ever could on your own. Alousy partnership, on the other hand, can drain your resources,derail your plans, and shatter whatever personal relationship youmay have had with your partner.
Before you jump at the prospect of teaming up with your best
friend or in-law, consider some of the pros and cons to partner-ships addressed in the following sections.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 20820_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 208Investigating potential benefits
Partnerships offer several advantages for real estate investors,
including the following:
/H12012Additional resources: These resources come in the form of
time, money, and skills.
/H12012Increased networking opportunities: Your partner can intro-
duce you to additional business and personal contacts.
/H12012Shared workload and responsibilities: Your partner can
pitch in to take on some of the chores, so the two of you have
more time and energy to invest in other projects. In addition,your partner may have skills and experience to take on tasksyou’re unqualified to perform.
/H12012Shared risk: If you and your partner are sharing the profits,
you should also be divvying up the risk, so you stand to lose
less if a property fails to turn a profit.
/H12012Diverse insight and input on business decisions: Your part-
ner may have a unique perspective and even better insight
into potentially profitable investment properties, suppliers, orpast experiences.
/H12012Increased accountability: Having to answer to a partner often
motivates individuals to fulfill their responsibilities, follow
through on promises, and avoid making impulse decisions
Considering potential drawbacks
Given the fact that partnerships often fail, they obviously have
some potential drawbacks, including the following:
/H12012Trust issues: Partners have been known to run off with the
cash, so choose a trustworthy partner and keep an eye on the
money. (You and your partners should all review the financialrecords on a regular basis.)
/H12012Disagreements about who’s doing more: One of the most
common disagreements that arises in partnerships centers on
who’s doing more for or giving more to the partnership. If you’redoing all the work and start to feel that your partner is just abean counter, you’re likely to feel some underlying resentmentthat will eventually find some way of expressing itself.
/H12012Asset sharing: As partners, you may share ownership in prop-
erties. If you or your partner wants to liquidate a particular
asset and the other person doesn’t, conflicts can arise.Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 20920_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 209/H12012Power sharing: If you need to call all the shots, you may have
trouble with a partner who wants to share in the decision-
making process.
/H12012Legal responsibilities: Inside a partnership, if one of the part-
ners makes a mistake, other partners may be held legally liable.
Asking yourself whether you really need a partner
You’ve reviewed the pros and cons of having a partner, and you’re
still not sure whether forming a partnership is the right move foryou. Do you really need a partner? Here are some general guide-lines to help you decide:
/H12012If you’re partnering just to get your mitts on some cash, you
probably don’t need a partner. As long as you found a greatinvestment opportunity, you can probably find the financingelsewhere and keep all the profits to yourself. With a partner-ship, you’d probably end up paying more in profit sharingthan you’d pay in interest, even if you used hard money.
/H12012If you’re partnering just to limit your exposure to risk, you’re
thinking about the investment all wrong. If you’re already thatworried about the risk, maybe you’re looking at a propertyyou shouldn’t buy.
/H12012If you’re partnering because the investor has more knowledge
or experience or skills than you do, you’re probably making theright move. You share a cut of the profits but are likely to makewiser investment decisions and earn an education in the process.
Partnerships also make sense if you’re partnering to share theworkload. One partner may have more time and flexibility than theother to take phone calls, search for investment properties, anddeal with contractors. Just make sure your partner has the skills aswell as the time to perform these tasks.
Finding a Partner with 
the Right Stuff
A partnership requires outstanding communication skills to survive
and thrive, so partnerships often crumble when partners disagreeabout the division of work and money.
Choose your partner as carefully (or perhaps even more carefully)
as you would choose a spouse or significant other, and work togetherto communicate your visions, dreams, ideas, and any problems youmay have that may negatively affect your partnership. Being open,Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 21020_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 210honest, and understanding can keep your partnership on an 
even keel.
In the following sections, we show you how to search for partners
with the right stuff, screen candidates, and make sure you bothhave something to gain from the relationship.
Scoping out prospective partners
Because this is a book on financing real estate investments, we
assume that you have the knowledge and skills to make solid invest-
ment decisions. As such, you’re in the market for the right partnerwho can deliver the financing, and you need to know where you canfind people who fit the bill. Here’s a list of places to start:
/H12012Family and friends: People you already know are generally a
little more trustworthy than complete strangers. The only
drawback is that if the partnership suffers, your relationshipwith the person is also likely to take a hit, which is a veryimportant consideration.
/H12012Business owners or associates: Doctors, dentists, attorneys,
and other professionals may have money that they’d prefer
investing in real estate rather than the stock market, if theyonly knew how to go about it. In addition, these professionalsrarely have the time to invest in real estate. Consider teamingup with someone you already do business with.
/H12012Mortgage brokers: Your mortgage broker may be willing to
partner with you, and even if she isn’t, she probably knows
others in the market who are eager to partner with a realestate investor. Ask your broker to put you in touch withothers who may be interested in forming a partnership.
/H12012Real estate agents: Real estate agents sell homes, but many
also invest in real estate. After all, nobody knows the market
like a qualified agent. An agent may not have the time to shopfor real estate, put together deals, oversee repairs and renova-tions, and manage properties, so the right candidate may bewilling to partner with someone who does.
/H12012Real estate attorneys: In addition to knowing the market and
having plenty of connections, a good real estate attorney may
have money to invest in real estate. Consider asking your realestate attorney whether he’d be interested in becoming yourpartner.Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 21120_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 211/H12012Accountants: By their very nature, accountants work with
business owners and individuals who are looking for invest-
ments and tax deductions. Approach your accountant and askwhether she has any clients looking for income opportunities.
/H12012Real estate investment groups: Join a local real estate invest-
ment group and network to identify potential candidates for
partnerships. To find a group in your area, try visiting theNational Real Estate Investors Association Web site at
www.nationalreia.com , click “Find a REIA”, and use the
resulting map to track down a local group.
Be careful when shopping for partners through real estate
investment groups. Con artists often join groups to find eager investors to scam. Remember, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Make sure the person has along history and a strong reputation in the community.
Checking a prospective 
partner’s qualifications
When you partner with someone, you’re essentially hiring one
another to do a job or provide some sort of service, such as financ-ing. You wouldn’t hire employees before checking whether they arewho they say they are or can deliver what they promise, so don’tpartner with someone until you’ve checked the following:
/H12012Personal identification: If you don’t know the individual per-
sonally, make sure you have the person’s name, address, and
phone number. Verify that the address exists (and the personlives there) and that the phone number is accurate. Ask for acopy of his driver’s license, and offer him a copy of yours.
/H12012References: Ask the person for three personal and three busi-
ness references, and then check those references.
/H12012Background: You can order a background check on the Internet
on sites such as www.ZabaSearch.com . Even if you think you
know the person well, order a background check to make sure
the person isn’t on the FBI’s Most Wanted List. Do a quick publicrecords search at the same time to check for lawsuits.
/H12012Credit report: Before entering into a partnership agreement,
ask your future partner to provide you with a copy of her
credit report. The last thing you need is to be supporting adeadbeat or someone who’s on the verge of bankruptcy.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 21220_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 212Making sure your partner has what
you need and needs what you have
Investing in real estate with your favorite cousin may seem like a
whole lot of fun, but you have to ask yourself whether it’s a wisebusiness decision. Sure, you two get along swell and you’re soclose that trust really isn’t an issue, but do you have complemen-tary skills and resources?
One of the most common mistakes people make when choosing a
partner is to choose someone who’s just like them. You definitelywant someone you can get along with, but you also want someonewith a different set of skills and resources. If you’re both great atfixing up properties but neither of you is very good with crunchingnumbers, you may run into problems.
In the following sections, we describe the skills and resources indi-
viduals often swap when forming productive real estate investmentpartnerships.
Trading experience for cash or credit
Experienced real estate investment professionals often trade their
skills, knowledge, and experience for cash or credit. This exchangeis essentially what you’re doing whenever you take out a loan tofinance the purchase of an investment property. You exchangeyour skills and experience in exchange for the cash you need topurchase a property and profit from it, so the relationship betweenyou and the lender is mutually beneficial.Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 213
Tripping into a partnership
Almost by accident, my (Chip’s) first foreclosure property turned into a partnership
deal. On a whim, I pitched an offer to the Bank of Florida on an REO property it hadlisted. I offered 75 percent of the listed price and asked for 100-percent seller financ-ing (because I didn’t have any money). To my surprise, the bank accepted the offer,but I faced another challenge — I still had no money to cover the cost of repairsand renovations and other expenses.
One of the real estate agents in my office had heard about my deal and offered to
put up the cash I needed in exchange for a 50/50 split. I had the time and energy butno money, and he had no time but extra cash to put to work.
Six months later, we each walked away with several thousands of dollars in our
pockets.20_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 213You can also trade experience for cash or credit by partnering with
someone who has the cash or can qualify for loans when you can’t.Perhaps the person has lots of cash or a stronger equity positionto borrow against.
Trading cash or credit for experience
If you have plenty of money or a solid credit score but little experi-
ence as an investor, you may be in a better position to find a part-ner who’s more experienced than you. You deliver the money, andthe other investor provides the skills and know-how to find greatdeals and make them profitable for both of you.
Even if you’re just the moneyman or -woman, we encourage you to
acquire some basic skills and knowledge. The more you know aboutthe real estate market in your area, the safer your investment is.Take an interest in the properties that your more knowledgeablepartner is dealing in, and pick your partner’s brain to find out asmuch as possible. If anything were to happen to your partner, wouldyou be able to sort out where all the money and assets are? Decidewho’s going to keep the books, and review them together on a regu-lar and frequent basis.
Trading cash for credit or vice versa
Most real estate deals require a combination of cash and credit.
You need cash for a down payment and closing costs, and creditfor the rest. In some partnerships, one partner has a stronger posi-tion in terms of cash, and the other has a better credit history.Working together, they can make deals happen that neither of themcould do on their own.
Drawing Up a Partnership
Agreement
Establishing a partnership requires no formal steps, but having a
partnership agreement in place can be very useful in avoiding prob-lems down the road. A 
partnership agreement lays out all the rules
governing the relationship — who’s in charge of what, how much
money each partner is contributing, how they’re going to divide theworkload, and how they plan to share the profits (and losses). Italso spells out how the partners divvy up the assets in the eventthat the parties choose to dissolve the partnership. This sectiongives you the lowdown on putting such an agreement in place.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 21420_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 214Without an agreement in writing, any conflict resolution occurs not
in accordance with what you and your partners agreed on but ratherby the guidelines in the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and RevisedUniform Partnership Act (RUPA). Ask your attorney whether yourstate has adopted either of these acts, because it may affect the waythe partnership is handled upon dissolution.
Drafting the agreement
A partnership agreement is only as good as the details it contains.
Simply by going through the process of writing up an agreementand discussing its terms, you and your partner can clarify yourroles, responsibilities, and division of profits and losses.
Your partnership agreement should cover the following:
/H12012Nature and purpose: State the type of business, the purpose
of your relationship, and the exact roles that each of you will
play in the partnership.
/H12012Capital contributions: State how much startup capital each
partner is contributing to the business and how each will be
reimbursed after the business becomes profitable. If morecapital is necessary later, what percentage of the needed capi-tal is each partner responsible for contributing? What hap-pens if that partner can’t contribute his or her portion?
/H12012Profit and loss sharing: Specify how the partners will share
any profits or losses, including how the accounting will be
done and how profits and losses will be reported to all part-ners. Consult an accountant who’s experienced in workingwith real estate investors, and review the records with allpartners periodically.
/H12012Authority: How much authority does each partner have in
making decisions? Do you each have equal say in which prop-
erties you purchase? Are each of you planning to be involvedin the overall strategy — buy and sell or buy and rent? Spellout exactly which of you is the final decision-maker. What hap-pens in the event of a tie?
/H12012Signature authority: Who has the authority to sign checks,
documents, and agreements? Are two or more signatures
required, or does one person hold sole authority?
Even if you have an agreement with the bank that two signa-
tures (yours and your partner’s) are required on all checks,don’t expect the bank to enforce the rule. The bank may onlybe responsible for any losses due to fraudulent activities thatChapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 21520_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 215have occurred in the past 30 days. Carefully review your
finances monthly to look for any payments that seem out ofthe ordinary.
/H12012Addition of new partners: If you add new partners later, how
will the profits be divided? Make sure you address this subject
well in advance of taking on any new partners.
/H12012Partner problems: What happens if one partner becomes
incapacitated? How are you protected in the event of a
divorce or bankruptcy by a partner?
/H12012Dissolution of the partnership: This provision is one of the
most important areas of any partnership agreement. If the
partnership dissolves for whatever reason, this arrangementprovides you and your partners with an exit strategy. Yourpartnership agreement should cover the following:
•
Death of a partner: If a partner dies, how will that part-
ner’s share of the assets be distributed? Will they be
given to the deceased’s family or distributed amongother partners?
•
Buyout: Under what conditions can partners buy out the
interest of another partner — death, divorce, bank-
ruptcy, illegal activity? Specify the circumstances andhow the buyout amount is to be calculated.
•
Division of property: Describe exactly how you plan on
dividing the shared assets. Do you plan to assign certain
properties to each partner or liquidate the propertiesand divide the cash?
•
Ongoing transactions: If a partner who is leaving has
outstanding transactions, what percentage of the profits,
if any, are the other partners entitled to?
Your partnership agreement should also indicate whether this is ageneral or limited partnership. In a 
general partnership, all partners
share in the management and liability of the team. Limited partners
have little or no say in the management of the team and can limit
their personal exposure to liability. Defining what being in a limitedpartnership means can be confusing and complex, so consult yourattorney.
Drawing up a partnership agreement can be a very complex opera-
tion, so consult an attorney with experience in this area. When draw-ing up and signing a partnership agreement, you and your partnereach should bring your own attorney. In addition to protecting eachpartner’s interests, this arrangement gives each partner the confi-dence that the process is being handled properly and equitably.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 21620_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 216Complying with the tax code
One advantage of a partnership is that for tax purposes, the IRS
doesn’t recognize the partnership as a separate entity; thus, theprofits and losses flow through to the individual partners, and theentity itself doesn’t have to pay taxes.
Even so, the IRS still requires that the partnership file a separate
tax return showing its profits (or losses). As long as you keepdetailed financial records for each property, completing a returnfor the partnership isn’t exactly rocket science, but you should stillconsult with a tax specialist who’s experienced in working withreal estate investors. In addition to filling out all the paperwork foryou, a tax specialist can offer tax-savings tips that can more thancover the cost of hiring a specialist.
Avoiding Common Pitfalls
Partnerships dissolve for the same reasons that relationships com-
monly fall apart — lack of communication. To avoid most of thepitfalls of partnerships, meet with your partners regularly — atleast once per week — to keep everyone in the loop. Be preparedto meet even more often when challenges arise or new opportuni-ties present themselves. At these meetings, be sure you
/H12012Review the current status of each project and timelines for
completion.
/H12012Review the income/expense statements since the last meeting
to make sure your current projects are on solid financial footing.
/H12012Discuss new developments or changes on projects.
The meeting should be a place for conversation and constructive
discussion. Every partner should have a voice, but refrain from neg-ative comments or arguments. A problem isn’t something to argueover — it’s a challenge that you must work together to overcome.
When an investment becomes particularly challenging, one partner
is likely to feel more responsible for the problems than the otherand may be inclined to hide the problems from the partner. If youbegin to feel this way about a particular investment, it’s the firstsign of trouble. Instead of hiding the problem, share it with yourpartner, who may have a creative solution. One of the main bene-fits of having a partner is for the person’s support when times aretough. Don’t cut your partner out of the picture at a time when youreally need him.Chapter 13: Partnering to Share the Risk and the Equity 21720_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 217Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 218
Partnership gone to pot
Mary and her brother decided to form a partnership. She was sharp and had excel-
lent insight into the local real estate market, which enabled her to spot great oppor-tunities and transform them into pure gold. They both had a fairly strong work ethic andwere good with their hands, so they could work together on repairs and renovations.
Unfortunately, Mary’s brother turned into somewhat of a slacker. They acquired a
run-down rental property with a lot of potential, but Mary found herself getting stuckwith all the work. After investing a great deal of time and effort over the course ofseveral weeks fixing up the property, she began to resent her “partnership” withher brother.
When Mary finally found a buyer for the property, she no longer felt that the 50/50
split they had agreed upon was fair. A dispute ensued, and he refused to sign off onthe title, causing the deal to fall apart. When they finally came to an agreement, thebuyer was long gone, and they had to accept $12,000 less the next time around.
They haven’t spoken since.Although we can offer no surefire way to avoid situations such as this one, clearer
communication early on could have saved this partnership. If Mary and her brotherhad agreed in advance on details regarding workload and tasks each of them wouldbe responsible for, her brother may have realized early on that this partnership wassomething he was ill-prepared to do, or perhaps he would have felt more compelledto pitch in his 50 percent if it were in writing.20_422335-ch13.qxp  3/11/09  11:54 AM  Page 218Chapter 14

No-money-down deals are possible, but we’re not promoting easy, no-risk richesin real estate. The arrangements we describe in this chapter do carrysome risk and require some effort to pull together. In addition, youstill have to find properties with plenty of profit potential and trans-form those diamonds in the rough into real gems.21_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 219Financing Your Down Payment
with a Second Mortgage
Although we talk about various financing options as though they
exist in a vacuum, investors commonly use two or more financingprograms to fund a single project. An investor may, for example,take out a first mortgage to cover 80 to 90 percent of the purchaseprice, a second mortgage to cover the down payment, and a con-struction loan to cover the cost of repairs and renovations.
One of the most common ways to mix and match loan programs is
through an 80-20 loan, commonly called a 
piggy-back loan , as dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Taking out an 80-20 loan
When you don’t have enough money to buy a property, you borrow
the necessary dough. If you don’t have money for the down pay-ment, borrow that, too. Although tough to find, you can go with an80-20 loan. The only catch is that you have to disclose the detailsto the lenders, so they’re fully aware of what you’re doing.
An 
80-20 loan is actually two loans that cover the purchase price:
/H1201280:The first mortgage covers 80 percent of the purchase price.
/H1201220:A second mortgage covers a 20-percent down payment.
As you may have guessed, you can get creative with the 80-20 loan
strategy. If, for example, the first mortgage holder requires only 10 percent down, you can do a 90-10 loan.
80-20 loans are often perfect for situations in which the value of the
repaired property will be significantly more than the purchaseprice. Say you’re buying a run-down property with a current marketvalue of about $180,000 that would be worth about $250,000 if youfixed it up. You take out a first mortgage for $144,000, a secondmortgage for $36,000, and secure other financing or use your ownmoney to cover the cost of repairs and renovations (maybe$20,000).
You now have $200,000 into a property that’s worth $250,000. You
just created $50,000 in equity. You can now pull that equity out ofthe property by refinancing the second mortgage for close to thefull value of the property, minus the balance on the first mortgage.If you refinanced the second mortgage for $60,000, for example(leaving the property at an 82 percent L TV), you could pay off thePart IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 22021_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 220$36,000 plus the $20,000 in repairs and renovations, walk away
with $4,000, and still have $46,000 worth of equity in the property.
Ever since the mortgage meltdown of 2008, lenders have shied
away from these piggy-back loans. Although these loans may beharder to find in a slumping market, however, they’re always avail-able. You may just have to look a little harder to find them.
Disclosing your second mortgage
When you take out a second mortgage to cover the down payment,
you compromise your ability to make your payments when timesare tough, and you weaken the lender’s position. You now havenone of your own money tied up in the property, so you can affordto be less committed to it. Also, if the lender has to foreclose, ithas to deal not only with you but also with the holder of thesecond mortgage.
Lenders generally require a 10 to 20 percent down payment on a
property to ensure repayment of the loan. The down paymentgives you a vested interest in the property and offers some assur-ance to the lender that the property is worth more than you oweon it. If you encounter cash flow problems and have troublemaking the payments, you may be able to borrow against thatdown payment (the equity you have in the property) to buy your-self some time. If you default on the loan and the lender has to sellthe property, that down payment can help it recoup any loss.
Because 80-20 loans increase the first mortgage holder’s risk, the
law requires that you disclose the second mortgage and your plansto use it to cover the down payment. When you fill out the loanapplication, be sure to enter any information about “subordinatefinancing” in the space provided. Otherwise, you’re committing aform of fraud known as a 
silent second (see the nearby sidebar).
Wholesaling for Fun and Profit
If you’ve watched episodes of any house-flipping show or read any
of the dozen or so books on the art of flipping houses (includingRalph and Joe’s 
Flipping Houses For Dummies ), you know the
basics. You buy a house below market value, fix it up, and sell it.
Do it right and you earn a decent profit — 20 percent or better.
Some investors don’t like the whole fix-it-up part of the process, so
they skip that part. They buy a property below market value, markup the price, and place it back on the market. Others don’t evenlike to touch the property, so they skip another step — they act asChapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 22121_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 221bird dogs for other real estate investors, simply scoping out the best
properties and charging a finder’s fee. It’s pure middleman stuff.
Wholesaling allows you to buy and sell a property quickly without
ever actually taking possession of the property and without paying
any financing costs. In the following sections, we show you acouple of ways to execute these transactions properly.
Buying and selling options
One of the safest ways (legally and financially) to control proper-
ties is to purchase an option or right to sell the property. By pur-chasing an option, you’re not tying yourself to a purchaseagreement, which legally binds you to following through with thepurchase if you can’t find someone to buy the property.
With an 
option agreement, you have the right, not the obligation, to
purchase the property by a specified date. If you choose not to
exercise your option or the option expires, you lose only the moneyused to purchase the option. In the following sections, we give youthe lowdown on wholesaling by buying and selling options.
Buying options
Buying an option simply requires that you and the property owner
sign a contract and that you pay the owner the agreed-upon amountfor the option to purchase the property. Your attorney can draw upan option agreement for you or provide you with a boilerplate youcan modify for different situations.
How much you pay for an option varies depending on the property’s
value, current market conditions, and the direction you and theowner think the market is going. In most cases, you can expect topay anywhere from 1 to 5 percent of the property’s true marketvalue. Of course, the less you pay, the less pressure you’re under toeventually buy the property.
An option agreement may also include language that makes you
responsible for other expenses related to the property. The owner,for example, may require that you pay property taxes and insur-ance for the duration of the option. Such requests aren’t unusualor unreasonable; you must gauge for yourself whether the termswork for you. Just make sure that you can 
assign the option (trans-
fer it to another person).
Selling future cash-flow or equity positions
When you own an option, you control the property and can tap
into all the benefits that come with that control. In exchange forupfront cash, you can offer a partner or investor an option onPart IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 22221_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 222Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 223
The secret life of a silent second
To get around the down-payment requirement, some real estate insiders encour-
age home buyers to bend the rules by using a silent second mortgage (or silent
second for short). A silent second is a mortgage loan from another lender or the
seller that covers the down payment but isn’t disclosed to the first mortgage lender.
The silent second essentially fools the lender into thinking that you’re a more qual-ified borrower than you really are.
Many people try to justify this strategy by saying, “Nothing is silent about this mort-
gage. I know about it, and the person lending me the money for the silent secondknows about it. The bank lending me the money for the first mortgage is getting itsrequired 10-percent down payment, so why should it care?” Well, the bank caresbecause several problems accompany silent second scenarios:
/H12012By using a silent second, you’re borrowing 100 percent of the home’s value. If
property values dip or you fail to maintain the property, it can quickly becomeworth less than you owe on it. If you default on the loan, the lenders won’t beable to sell the property for enough to cover the balance due.
/H12012A silent second falsely qualifies you for perks (such as a lower interest rate and
not having to pay mortgage insurance) that you don’t really qualify for.
/H12012Silent seconds mislead the lender into approving a loan application it may have
rejected had you provided accurate financial information.
Whenever you apply for a loan, you must sign a Uniform Residential Loan Application,
often referred to as a 1003 (ten-oh-three), stating that the information you provided
on the loan application is accurate and complete. Omitting a “minor” detail, such as
a silent second, makes you guilty of committing mortgage fraud — a felony. Nomatter how harmless it may seem, no matter how many other people are doing it,it’s still fraud, so don’t do it.
What if your relatives loan you the money? If they 
loan you the money, you still fall
in the silent second scenario. Now, if they give you the money, you’re safe and have
committed no crime.
Remember, whenever you fail to disclose information to the lender that may com-
promise your ability to obtain loan approval, whatever the reason, it results indeceiving the lender and failing to honor the letter and the spirit of the law. Using asilent second is a crime.future cash flow from the property or an eventual equity position if
certain conditions are met:
/H12012Cash flow: If you’re investing in a rental property, you can offer
your partner or investor a certain percentage of the monthly
profits for a given period of time or until you eventually sellthe property.21_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 223/H12012Equity position: If you’re planning on fixing up and selling the
property, you can offer your partner or investor a certain per-
centage of any profit you earn when you sell the property.
When scoping out prospective partners or investors, ask about theirinvestment goals. Are they looking for a steady cash flow or to scorea quick profit, or are they open to either strategy? By finding outabout their goals, you can more easily determine whether you’re theright fit and what sort of terms to offer them. If the proposed cashflow makes sense, you can even split the equity or cash flow intoportions, selling off percentages of each to different investors.Typically this strategy only makes sense in larger commercial prop-erties. Refer to Chapter 13 for more on utilizing partnerships.
Negotiating tenant sale options
When you control a property with a lease option agreement, as
explained in Chapter 12, you can negotiate your own lease optionwith another tenant. In tougher markets with tighter credit, leasinga property may be easier than selling or flipping it.
In these circumstances, you can negotiate an attractive lease option
for your tenant on top of your option, providing for some additionalcash flow in the 
spread (difference between the two lease amounts).
This is a great arrangement if you’re dealing with a real dontwanner
(as in “the owner don’t want her”) or a long-distance seller who has
no use for the property (such as an estate situation).
Make sure your tenant’s option to buy expires several months
before yours, so if your tenant decides not to exercise her option,you have 
plenty of time to make other arrangements, such as
obtaining the financing you need to exercise your option.
Assigning a purchase agreement
A somewhat riskier way to practice wholesaling is to tie up the
property with a purchase agreement, find a buyer for the propertywho’s willing to pay more than you agreed to pay for it, and thenassign your purchase agreement to the buyer. In the following sec-tions, we show you how it’s done.
Securing the right to buy and sell the property
The first step in wholesaling is to get the property owner/seller to
agree to sell you the property with the option to sell it to someoneelse. You pitch your offer the same way you would if you wereactually buying the property for yourself — you present a pur-chase agreement. (Your real estate agent or attorney can assist youPart IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 22421_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 224in wording it properly for your jurisdiction. For specifics on negoti-
ating a purchase agreement, check out Real Estate Investing For
Dummies , by Eric Tyson and Robert S. Griswold [Wiley].) The pur-
chase agreement should include the following adjustments:
/H12012Instead of listing yourself as the buyer, you list yourself as
“and/or assignees.” This wording means that either you or
someone else can buy the property.
/H12012Set a closing date at least 60 days from the time the agree-
ment is fully executed. The more time you have to sell the
property, the better.
/H12012Make the purchase agreement conditional upon the property
passing inspection. You don’t want to get stuck with a lemon.
/H12012Disclose the fact that you’re purchasing the property as an
investor and not to reside in yourself. Otherwise, you may
expose yourself to legal issues — such as claims that you’re
illegally flipping the property to inflate its value.
Selling your interest
After you secure controlling interest in the property, you essentially
become the seller’s real estate agent. Your job is to find a buyer.You can accomplish this goal in all sorts of ways — advertising theproperty in the local papers, listing it online, networking with otherinvestors, or selling it to a friend or relative.
Advertise the property for more than you agreed to pay the seller
but less than the property’s true market value. Otherwise, you mayget stuck holding the property beyond the time you’ve given your-self to sell it in the purchase agreement.
As soon as you find a buyer, attach an addendum to the contract
essentially stating that you’re assigning the contract to the buyerfor a certain amount of money. The seller, you, and the buyer mustsign the addendum. After you do, you can contact the escrow com-pany to process the transaction and schedule the closing.
Any gain you realize on the sale of your option becomes a short-
term gain, qualifying as taxable income. If you do several of these,you may be considered a dealer and may need to secure a real estatelicense. Check with your accountant and the state licensing board.
If you can’t find a buyer in time, in accordance with the contract,
you lose your deposit (at the very least). You also lose 
a lot of credi-
bility and can be sued for specific performance and be forced by the
seller, through the courts, to purchase the property. Securing an
option is a much safer route to take. See “Buying and Selling Options”earlier in this chapter for details.Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 22521_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 225Selling the Tax Benefits
When April 15 rolls around, every homeowner remembers one of the
primary benefits of owning real estate in America — tax deductions.Thanks to the huge amount of interest homeowners typically pay ontheir mortgage, they can often itemize their deductions to claim abigger tax write-off than they’d get from a standard deduction.
Although investors don’t always get the same tax breaks as home-
owners, you can deduct expenses against any income you receivefrom renting or selling properties to help reduce your taxes. Realestate investors are well aware of these tax breaks, but some fail torealize that they may be able to earn a profit by 
selling their tax
savings to others.
This strategy may sound a little strange at first, but realize that
every property has expenses, and every expense represents apotential deduction. Deductions are there for the taking, and theIRS really doesn’t care who takes credit for them as long as onlyone party uses each deduction.
Investors receiving or due to receive significant capital gains from
their investments may be looking for ways to offset those gainswith capital losses. As such, they may be looking for short-termdeductions or losses as a trade-off for long term equity or cashflow. If you don’t need the deductions, consider selling them tosomeone who does.
Consult a tax advisor or accountant for advice on handling such
transactions appropriately. You don’t want to get yourself in a situ-ation in which you and other investors are mistakenly claiming thesame expenses as deductions. In addition, keep in mind that whenyou sell a tax benefit, you’re losing deductions that could benefit youwhen tax time rolls around. Make sure you’re earning enough sellingtax benefits in excess of what those benefits would save you in taxes.
Trading Spaces: 1031 Exchanges
Another idea for a no-money-down option is executing a trade. A
1031 exchange is a strategy for deferring the payment of capital gains
taxes on the profit of a sale. This exchange treats the sale of the first
property and the purchase of the second as a single transaction —an exchange.
A 1031 exchange is sort of like an IRA (individual retirement account)
rollover. With an IRA rollover, you can avoid paying taxes and penal-ties on money withdrawn from one retirement account by depositingPart IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 22621_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 226Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 227
Flipping contracts? Tread carefully
Some real estate investment gurus promote a strategy called flipping contracts ,
which involves a double-closing — often referred to as a pass-through transaction.
We strongly discourage you from doing it, but we believe you should understand
how this scheme works in case someone calls it something different and tries toconvince you it’s okay. Here’s how it works:
1. You (the 
contract flipper ) sign a purchase agreement with the seller obtaining
the right to purchase the property by a specified date.
You pay a deposit — typically anywhere from about 1 to 10 percent of the asking
price. (You agree to buy the property for less than market value so you can sellat or slightly below market value and earn a profit.)
2. You find a buyer who signs a purchase agreement with the commitment to pay
more for the property than you’ve agreed to pay the seller.
The typical goal is to earn $5,000 to $10,000, but this amount can vary.
3. The seller deeds the property to you, depositing the deed with an escrow 
company.
4. You deed the property to the buyer, depositing the deed with the escrow 
company.
5. The buyer obtains financing, giving the lender instructions to pay the loan pro-
ceeds to the escrow company.
6. The escrow company performs two closings back-to-back — closing the deal
between you and the buyer and between you and the seller.You receive your profit, the seller receives the remaining proceeds, and the
escrow company records the deeds with the county’s register of deeds, show-ing the buyer as the new legal owner of the property.
Flipping contracts may sound rosy, but we strongly discourage you from doing sofor several reasons, including the following:
/H12012Flipping contracts is borderline fraud. Traditionally, a property’s market value
is determined by the price a seller is willing to accept and a buyer is willing to
pay (whichever is lower). By jacking up the price as a middleman, you’re artifi-cially inflating the market value.
/H12012You put your reputation on the line. Reputable real estate investors rarely
engage in this practice. We suggest only a more experienced investor do so.it into another qualifying retirement account within a certain
number of days. The same principle applies to 1031 exchanges.You can sell one qualifying property and buy another of equal orgreater value (within a certain period) to avoid paying a capitalgains tax on the profit from the sale.21_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 227Without such an exchange, any profit from the sale is subject to cap-
ital gains tax, which can negatively affect your cash flow and pur-chase power. If you pay a short-term capital gains tax of 30 percent,for example, on the sale of a $300,000 property, you pay $90,000 intaxes and have only $210,000 left to make your next purchase.
Qualifying for a 1031 exchange
To fully qualify for a 1031 exchange, the two properties must meet
the following conditions:
/H12012The two properties must be like kind. This rule essentially
means that they have to be investment properties both
located in the United States. You can exchange a farm for anoffice building, but you can’t exchange an office building inthe U.S. for an office building in Italy or vice versa. (Like kindapplies to real estate investments, not primary residences orvacation homes.)
/H12012The purchase price of the property you’re receiving must
be greater than or equal to the purchase price of the prop-erty you’re giving up.
In other words, you can’t exchange a
more valuable property from one of lesser value and pocket
all the proceeds; although you can do a partial exchange aslong as you pay taxes on the net gain, as discussed later inthis section.
/H12012All the equity in the property you’re giving up must be used
to acquire the replacement property. In other words, you
can’t use any proceeds from the exchange for other purposes,
such as fixing up the property you received in the exchangeor buying yourself a new car (too bad for the auto industry).
You can qualify for partial exchanges under the rules, but whateverprofits you walk away with after the exchange are subject to capitalgains tax. For example, if you sell a property for $200,000 in exchangefor one you purchase for $175,000, your $25,000 profit is subject tocapital gains tax.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 228
/H12012Doing a quick flip like this makes the property ineligible for certain types of
financing. HUD has an anti-flipping provision for FHA-insured loans; it won’t
finance any property that has been transferred within the last 90 days, and
requires two appraisals for any property that’s had a transfer of ownership in 91to 180 days (to confirm the property’s true market value). A double-closing thathikes up the price of the property in a matter of seconds obviously makes it inel-igible for FHA financing. This guideline has also become standard practice formost conventional lenders.21_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 228Meeting the deadlines
To qualify for a 1031 exchange, not only must the properties qualify,
but you must also meet the deadlines for processing the buy andsell transactions. You can’t sell a property today, buy another onesix months later, and claim the exchange exemption. Your transac-tion must fall within the following two deadlines:
/H12012Identification period: You have 45 days from the day you close
on the sale of the first property to identify a replacement. You
can choose more than one property (and probably should) justin case you can’t close on your first choice in time.
/H12012Exchange period: You have 180 days from the day you close
on the sale of the first property to close on the purchase of
the replacement property.
These cut-off dates are firm — you don’t get an extension or graceperiod if the deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.
You do need to disclose the exchange on your tax return. 
Consult your accountant to make sure you comply with the disclosure rules that govern 1031 exchanges.
Selling Other Equitable Interests
When dealing with larger commercial properties or unique real
estate holdings, you can get even more creative with financingbecause you have more assets to offer for sale or trade. What elsedoes the property offer? Do you have billboards you can lease outor space for a health club to divide off? Does the property have aremote corner that would be good for hunting or other recreation?You can use any or all of these options (and options like them) tofinance your project.
After you control the property, you can harness the power of that
property’s assets to secure quick cash to fund the deal or generatecash flow. In the following sections, we offer some suggestions.
Leaseholds and other rights
Many investors have gotten rich by buying real estate and quickly
leasing off their interests while retaining rights to the land itself.Using 
leaseholds or leasehold estates, you can sell the property rights
while retaining ownership of the land. Just north of me (Chip), for
example, many property owners are leasing groundwater rights toNestle Corporation for its bottling plants. As soon as the leaseholdexpires, the land reverts to the original owner.Chapter 14: Profiting from No-Money-Down Deals 22921_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 229You can lease your property rights to gas and oil companies, cities
and towns (for water), farmers (for harvesting corn or wheat),ranchers (for cattle grazing), logging companies, and so forth.
Timber or logging rights can bring in substantial sums to finance to
acquisition or to repair and renovate a property. One investor pur-chased 80 acres of land and leased off the hardwood timber rightsfor $40,000 a year, which covered the down payment and construc-tion costs on the home. He subsequently sold off the excess landand then sold the house for a $100,000 profit. The best part: Thegovernment financed everything.
Naming rights, air rights, and 
other unimaginable stuff
Many owners of investment properties are too close to their own
deal to envision all the possibilities. Due to their short-sightedness,they often overlook golden opportunities and leave a lot of moneyon the table. When you’re looking for extra sources of capital tofund a deal, replace cash you already borrowed, or generate addi-tional revenue streams, open your mind to all the possibilities. Hereare some ideas that can begin to stimulate your own creativity:
/H12012Lease the naming rights of the building. Some companies are
willing to pay big bucks to have a stadium named after them.
Lucas Oil, for example, agreed to pay the Indianapolis Colts$120 million over 20 years for the honor of having the Colts’new stadium named after the company. Although it didn’tquite cover the entire $500 million price tag, it helped easesome of the sticker shock.
/H12012Create leases for air rights with radio, television, or satellite
services off the roof. One of the most famous real estate deals —
the creation and sale of the air rights for New York’s Empire
State Building — instantly doubled the building’s value.
/H12012Allow a cellphone carrier to construct a cell tower in a
remote corner of the property or on top of the roof. These
can be very lucrative leases. I (Chip) have a client who owns a
small home on about 10 acres. Her mortgage payment is only
$362, but on a high corner of her property sits a 2,500 squarefoot fence guarding a cell transfer tower that generates $1,467per month for the next 10 years guaranteed!
/H12012Sell off mailing leases for valuable addresses. Folks in high-
rent districts like Manhattan or Beverly Hills often sell rights
to their mailing addresses to small companies looking for anestablished or well-known address.Part IV: Sampling More Creative Financing Strategies 23021_422335-ch14.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 230Part V

Ten Ways to Avoid Common
Beginner Blunders
In This Chapter
/H17075Overcoming any obsession over low interest rates
/H17075Performing your due diligence
/H17075Comparison-shopping for the best deal
/H17075Staying abreast of current real estate market conditions
Many ill-informed investors become overenthusiastic about
the big picture and lose sight of the critical details that can
make or break a deal. They pay too much for a property, underesti-mate the cost of repairs and renovations, fail to inspect a propertyor research the title, or sign contracts they don’t fully understand.
You shouldn’t overanalyze to the point of paralysis, but you do need
to stay on top of the details from beginning to end. In this chapter,we present ten common real estate financing blunders to help youavoid costly mistakes and maximize your profits from the very start.
Focusing on More than Just 
a Low Interest Rate
When shopping for attractive financing, novice investors often get
so hung up on interest rates that they talk themselves out of greatdeals. They meet a hard-money lender who’s charging six pointsand 10 percent interest and immediately think the person is rippingthem off. Instead of thinking about how much the other person isearning, focus your thoughts on what you stand to earn.23_422335-ch15.qxp  3/11/09  11:55 AM  Page 233If the numbers work, the interest rate and fees don’t matter. Financing
fees and interest are just another cost to include in your calculations.If you can afford the financing and still earn the desired profit, don’tworry about what you’re paying. Having access to the money youneed to do the deal is what matters most.
Getting Preapproved
In the excitement of shopping for potentially profitable investment
properties, you may be tempted to shove the question of payingfor it aside. Don’t do it. Before you start shopping for investmentproperties, meet with your loan officer or mortgage broker and getpreapproval. You can then move quickly and decisively when youdiscover potentially profitable properties.
Although most people generally shop first and think about paying
for stuff later, this strategy compromises your ability to negotiatean attractive purchase price and terms. You can certainly present apurchase agreement that includes as a condition your ability tosecure financing, but if another buyer shows up with cash orpreapproved financing, she has a significant advantage.

The real estate community has a saying: “Buyers are liars, and sellers
are worse.” When you’re thinking about buying a property, don’t takeanything the seller tells you at face value. Don’t rely solely on sellerdisclosures to identify potential problems. Do your own research:
/H12012Obtain a title commitment (refer to Chapter 12) to make sure the
person selling the property is the rightful owner and that theproperty is unencumbered by other 
liens (claims against 
the property).
/H12012Visit the property and inspect it as closely as possible with
your own two eyes. Take the following pledge: “My eyes or nobuys.” Never buy a property site unseen. For more about eval-uating properties, check out

Chapter 3) to make sure the property’s market value is in linewith the price you’re planning to offer.
/H12012Pick up a copy of the city worksheet on the property by visit-
ing your town hall (or the equivalent). The worksheet contains
a history of the property, including any building permits and
code violations.
/H12012For commercial properties, get records of the property’s
income and expenses for the past two years. Have the sellersupply you with the past couple of years’ tax returns on theproperty. (Refer to Chapter 8.)

and resolve any issues before signing the final papers. (Referto Chapter 7 for more info.)
/H12012Purchase title insurance for the property (check out Chapter 7)
to protect you in the event that someone claims rights to theproperty after closing.
/H12012Check the county tax assessor’s office for tax liens or special
assessments. (Head to Chapter 4 for more info.)
Making a Reasonable 
Down Payment
For investment properties, lenders often demand a hefty down
payment for the most attractive interest rates and terms. A 20-to-25percent down payment isn’t out of the ordinary.
Keep in mind, however, that the more money you put down on a
property, the less you have available for other investments. You maybe better off paying a higher interest rate with a lower down paymentif you can put that extra money to work in another investmentproperty.
Instead of putting 25 percent or more down on a property, for
example, try negotiating a seller-held second mortgage, or a landcontract sale with a 10 percent down payment. Fix up the property,and then refinance it later with the increased equity, so you’remore likely to qualify for a lower interest rate without such a heftydown payment.
Conserving cash is best — even if it means having to pay higher
interest rates or increased long-term costs. It’s all about cash flow!Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Avoid Common Beginner Blunders 23523_422335-ch15.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 235Comparing at Least Three 
Good Faith Estimates
Financing real estate purchases is the equivalent of shopping for
money, and to find the best deals, you need to comparison-shop.Obtain at least three 
Good Faith Estimates (a detailed breakdown of
all the projected loan costs) from different lenders, and compare
the following:
/H12012Interest rate
/H12012Discount points (prepaid interest)
/H12012Closing costs and other fees
/H12012Annual percentage rate (APR) or the percentage rate factoring
in interest, points, and fees
/H12012Term (number of months or years to pay back the loan)
/H12012Any prepayment penalties or refinancing conditions
Although having access to cash trumps concerns over the costs of
financing, you still want to get the best deal possible. For moreabout comparing loans, refer to Chapter 6.
Viewing at Least Ten Properties
before Making an Offer
First-time investors often see a property for sale and think to them-
selves, “Wow, this is a prime piece of real estate.” They then pro-ceed to purchase it without spending any time evaluating themarket. They have no idea what other comparable properties areselling for or what those properties have to offer. As a result, theyoften pay far too much.
The first property you see may be the best deal around, but you
don’t know that until you look around. Make a rule to view at leastten comparable properties before making an offer on one of them.Doing so forces you to slow down and make better-informed deci-sions. As you become more familiar with your market, you canbegin to evaluate them much more quickly and accurately withouthaving to follow this ten-for-one rule.Part V: The Part of Tens 23623_422335-ch15.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 236Checking Your Credit Score 
before Applying for a Loan
Credit is the one thing you can’t buy. When you apply for a loan,
the first thing the lender does is check your credit score and his-tory. If you have a lousy credit score and a checkered financialpast, the lender is going to either reject your loan application orcurb the risk by requiring a larger down payment, charging higherinterest and fees, and perhaps even requiring that you purchaseprivate mortgage insurance (PMI).
To avoid wasting time (the lender’s and yours) and enduring costly
loans, check your credit score and history before applying for aloan. If your report contains any errors, contact the credit report-ing agency and have them corrected, if possible.
If your credit score is below 680, work toward improving it. Pay
your bills on time, pay down any large balances you’re carrying oncredit cards, and take other steps to boost your score. Chapter 3offers some additional suggestions.
Buying with Your Brain 
and Not Your Heart
You may fall in love with a property, but don’t follow the dictates of
your heart when investing in real estate. Remember, this is busi-ness (not a hobby), and the numbers have to work. Depending onyour strategy, take one of the following two courses:
/H12012Buy and sell: If you’re buying the property to sell it for a profit,
shoot for at least a 20-percent profit and account for all of your
expenses, including purchase price, repair and renovationexpenses, 
holding costs (taxes, insurance, interest), marketing
costs, and sales commissions.
/H12012Buy and hold: If you’re buying the property to rent it out,
make sure it generates a positive cash flow — that annual
income exceeds annual expenses.Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Avoid Common Beginner Blunders 23723_422335-ch15.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 237Monitoring the Pulse of Current
Market Conditions
Like the stock market, the real estate market has its ups and
downs. Property values can rise or fall based on local economicconditions, changes in trends, and a host of other factors.Homeowners and investors witnessed just how dramatically thehousing market can shift course when the bubble burst in 2008.
Knowledge is power. As an investor, keeping abreast of the fluctua-
tions in the marketplace can pay dividends. It can prevent youfrom paying too much for a property, buying the wrong property atthe wrong time, and perhaps even selling too early or too late. Allreal estate is local. Make sure you know what’s going on in yourown backyard.
Calculating the NOI and DSCR 
on Commercial Properties
With commercial properties, you focus less on the resale value of a
property and more on the net revenue that property can generatefor you. As a result, you’re not simply looking at the market valueof the property. You need to work the numbers and determine theproperty’s NOI and DSCR:
/H12012Net Operating Income (NOI) is the profit the property gener-
ates monthly or annually. To calculate the NOI, you total all
the income the property brings in, and then subtract all yourexpenses. 
/H12012Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is the number that lenders
use to evaluate the risk versus the rewards. The higher the ratio,
the better the deal — and the better the financing options. Tocalculate the DSCR, divide the NOI by the annual debt serviceon the loan (total annual payments on the loan, including inter-est and principal). A DSCR of 1.00 means that the property isbreaking even. A number of 1.20 indicates that the property is generating a decent profit. Riskier properties require a higherDSCR to justify the risk.
When it comes to investing, the numbers are the only things thatcount! Refer to Chapter 8 for additional details about these two calculations.Part V: The Part of Tens 23823_422335-ch15.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 238Chapter 16
Ten Steps to Take 
before Closing
In This Chapter
/H17075Examining the appraisal, title commitment, and closing documents
/H17075Insuring the property
/H17075Inspecting the property one last time
/H17075Having your money ready to go
The actual closing (when you receive rights to the property and
pay the seller) is typically uneventful — or at least everyone
involved hopes it will be. To ensure that the closing proceeds with-
out a glitch, you need to prepare in advance. You don’t want to beone of those inexperienced buyers who insist on reading everysingle word of every document at the closing table or shows upwithout the funds needed to close the deal.
In this chapter, we provide you with a checklist of ten things to do
prior to closing to make sure your closing proceeds as smoothly aspossible. You don’t need to complete the items in the order pre-sented here — just make sure you’ve attended to all the detailsprior to closing.
Get and Review a Copy 
of the Appraisal
As part of the process your lender follows in evaluating your loan
application, it orders an appraisal. Obtain a copy of the appraisaland use it to double-check your calculations (to make sure theproperty you’re about to purchase is likely to be profitable).24_422335-ch16.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 239With the appraisal, your lender wants to ensure the following:
/H12012The property value is in line with the purchase price.
/H12012The property (unless it’s a construction or rehabilitation loan)
shows the potential to generate more than enough annualincome to cover the annual loan payments.
If the appraiser seems to think that the property isn’t worth thepurchase price or that it won’t generate sufficient income to coverthe payments, the lender will probably reject your loan applica-tion. If the lender approves your loan despite flags raised by theappraiser, you should still be concerned about purchasing a ques-tionable investment property.
So what if the numbers don’t work? You have two choices:
/H12012Proceed: If you decide to proceed with the deal, make sure
the numbers on your pro forma, or projections, are conserva-
tive and realistic and show the lender that the property will
perform — and earn a profit — within the next three years.
/H12012Recede: If you decide to back away from the deal, you may
lose your earnest money deposit (EMD, the money you paid
the seller when you settled on a purchase agreement) and any
other expenses you’ve already paid. If your offer wasn’t condi-tional on a satisfactory appraisal (including value), you mayalso be liable for a 
specific performance suit that forces you to
complete the transaction.
Review the Title Commitment 
and Obtain Title Insurance
Contact your title company and obtain a copy of the title 
commitment — a report issued prior to closing that shows all liens
and other claims against a property. If the title commitment shows
a lien against the property that the seller failed to disclose or a breakin the chain of ownership (see Chapter 12), call this discrepancy tothe attention of the title company and your attorney. Address anyconcerns you have about the title prior to closing.
A title commitment that shows a clean title is no substitute for an
actual 
title policy, which insures against any losses in the event that
somebody shows up later with a rightful claim against the property.
A title company may miss something during its title search, soalways buy a policy to protect yourself against any oversights.Part V: The Part of Tens 24024_422335-ch16.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 240Review All Closing Documents
As soon as you know who’s handling the closing (usually a title com-
pany, but it can also be an attorney or escrow company), call andrequest a closing packet as soon as possible — at least a couple ofdays prior to closing so you have time to review all the documents.The closing packet should include at least the following items:
/H12012Mortgage or land contract
/H12012Deed
/H12012Promissory note
/H12012HUD-1 closing statement (see the following section for details)
Read through the documents to check for spelling or calculation
errors, to ensure your name and other information pertaining toyou is correct, and to verify that the numbers on the HUD-1 matchup with those on the Good Faith Estimate. (See Chapter 6 for moreon Good Faith Estimates.) If anything looks odd, call the title com-pany and have your issues addressed 
before closing.
If you have an attorney (and you should), make sure your attorney
also receives a copy of the closing packet prior to closing andreviews the documents.
Review a Copy of the HUD-1
Closing Statement
The HUD-1 statement is a universal closing statement used for all
residential (and many commercial) loan transactions. For larger
commercial properties, the format’s the same, but it may be pre-pared on the attorney’s or closing agent’s letterhead or form.
The HUD-1 is a key document — it has all the numbers, and every-
one involved in the transaction must sign off on it to enable theclosing agent to move forward with the disbursements. Althoughyou can try to get a copy several days in advance, the reality isthat numbers are still coming in at the last minute, and you maynot be able to review the final revised copy until just before theclosing. Ask anyway — according to RESPA, you’re entitled to see acompleted copy of the HUD-1 at least 24 hours in advance.Chapter 16: Ten Steps to Take before Closing 24124_422335-ch16.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 241Even though you’re the buyer, review both sides of the form. Look
at every line that has a number next to it and verify that each charge
or credit is listed properly. Review the seller’s side to make sure thateach lien payoff is listed, that taxes are computed correctly, and thatthe sellers are paying for the charges agreed to in the PurchaseAgreement. Bring any questionable items or amounts to the atten-tion of the closing agent as early as possible. By addressing anyHUD-1 issues prior to closing, you can remove at least some of theunnecessary stress and confusion. You don’t want to be discussing(or arguing over) charges at the closing.
Get an Insurance Policy
For many homeowners and investors, obtaining an insurance policy
is an afterthought. Meet with your insurance agent and explain thesituation. Make sure your agent knows that this is an 
investment
property . You’re likely to pay more for a policy on an investment
property, but if you buy a standard homeowner’s policy, it may not
provide sufficient protection or cover any damage.
Why would you obtain insurance before you took ownership? We
can offer you two good reasons:
/H12012The lender requires that you have an insurance policy in
place as a condition for financing the purchase. The lenderwants to make sure insurance is in place to protect its investment.
/H12012If the property burns down, blows away, or is swept up in
floodwaters a minute after you sign the closing papers, youcan lose your entire investment.
Insurance also comes in handy if the previous owners of a foreclo-sure property decide to trash the place out of spite on their wayout the door.
Do a Walk-Through 
on the Property
You may have inspected the property to the point of overkill, but
the day or morning before closing, visit the property again and do afinal walk-through to make sure it’s in the same condition (orbetter) as when you submitted your offer. Anything can happen to aproperty between the time you first see it and closing, so performyour due diligence and visit the property prior to closing. Inspectall four sides from the outside and walk through the interior.Part V: The Part of Tens 24224_422335-ch16.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 242Obtain Utility Final Readings and
Schedule the Transfer
Earning a profit on real estate often hinges on your ability to com-
plete repairs and renovations quickly. If you’ve already scheduledcontractors to start work but you failed to have the water, gas, andelectric turned on, you may end up paying a bunch of workers a lotof money for sitting around twiddling their thumbs. To avoid thisproblem, call the local utility companies (water, gas, and electric)prior to closing and obtain the final utility readings (or as close aspossible). Let each utility company know that you’re going to bethe new owner and will be transferring the account to your name.
Make sure the HUD-1 lists any outstanding water or sewer bills and
that the seller pays them at closing. These unpaid bills become a lienon the property. Most other utility charges attach to the previousowner, not the property.
In some cases, the utility company may not allow you to transfer
the account prior to closing, so you may need to transfer utilitiesover to your name immediately after closing. Have your agent con-tact the sellers and request that they bring their most recent utilitybills to the closing — they contain the phone numbers and accountnumbers you need. If necessary, the sellers can then call, requestthat the utilities be transferred to you, and then hand the phone tocomplete the transfer.
Review Updated Tenant Rent Roll
When purchasing a rental property complete with tenants, obtain
an updated tenant roll prior to closing to be sure no mass exodusof renters has occurred between the time you negotiated the pur-chase and the closing. The 
rent roll should include a listing of each
unit, the tenant, monthly lease amount, lease term and expiration,
deposit amount, and any lease concessions. As a commercialinvestor, keep in mind that you’re purchasing not only a buildingbut also an existing business complete with customers (the ten-ants). If something has driven your renters from the premises, youdeserve answers.
An updated rent roll at time of closing certifies when the seller
received the most recent lease payments and any deposits beingtransferred to you.Chapter 16: Ten Steps to Take before Closing 24324_422335-ch16.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 243Make sure the seller didn’t collect advance rents and fail to dis-
close them — that’s money you’ll never be able to recover later.For major tenants or large properties, we recommend that yourequest an 
estoppel letter from each tenant that confirms the lease
term, payment amount, deposit, and date of last payment.
Have Certified Funds or Wire
Transfer Ready to Go
Showing up to a closing without a certified check in hand or a wire
transfer ready to go for the amount you’re required to pay is likegoing on a hot date without your wallet. Your lender is responsiblefor making sure the big payment is ready to hand over to the seller,but you need to show up with your check for the down paymentand closing costs. Make sure it’s a certified check (from your bank)or a wire transfer.
Bring your checkbook, too, just in case you need to pay for some
unforeseen expenses that appear at closing. Don’t let your lenderor whoever’s handling the closing charge extra fees, but know thatyou may have to pay for legitimate out-of-pocket expenses, such asodd-days interest recalculation, an additional overnight fee for adisbursement, or an account transfer deposit with a utility com-pany or other service provider. For assistance in differentiatingbetween legitimate and illegitimate fees, refer to Chapter 6.
Confirm Date, Time, and 
Location of Closing
A lot of time and effort — and people — have been involved in the
transaction leading up to closing. With so many parties involved,closings often become major ordeals to conveniently schedule.Because you don’t want to end up at the wrong place at the wrongtime and have to reschedule, call the closing company or attorneyin charge of the closing a few days before you think the meeting isscheduled and confirm the date, time, and location.
If you’re not absolutely sure where the closing office is, get the
address and find directions online. If you have one of those GPSgadgets, all the better. Show up early — if more negotiating needsto be done, you don’t want it starting without you at the table!Part V: The Part of Tens 24424_422335-ch16.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 244Chapter 17
Ten Tips for Surviving 
a Credit Crunch
In This Chapter
/H17075Looking elsewhere for investment capital
/H17075Focusing on foreclosures, REOs, and short-sale opportunities
/H17075Changing to a buy-and-hold strategy
/H17075Teaming up with a mortgage broker and real estate agent
The days of easy credit (in the 1990s and first few years of the
new millennium) may be gone, but savvy investors know that
financing never completely dries up. You can always find lenderswilling to finance promising deals, particularly for real estateinvestors who have a proven track record (or at least an excellentplan for turning a profit).
Although some sort of financing is always available, the landscape
can change. To survive and thrive under the new conditions, youneed to be able to adapt, shift your strategy, and look for money inless likely places. This chapter offers some suggestions.
Don’t let a slow market get you down. When sales slump, buying
opportunities soar, and this is when savvy investors build wealth.
Expand Your Search
A credit crunch doesn’t mean that financing disappears — it just
means that you probably need to look for it somewhere else. Ifyou’re accustomed to working through banks, you may need toexplore the hard money option, as presented in Chapter 11. If that’snot an option, consider seller financing, as discussed in Chapter 12.
If you tried to cut out the middleman by working directly with
lenders, consider working through a broker instead. Having an25_422335-ch17.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 245expert on your side can give you more options and perhaps even
save you money.
The government can step in during a credit crunch (like it did
during the mortgage meltdown) to stimulate the economy.Although conventional (nongovernment) loans may be scarcer,you may discover that government loans, such as FHA loans, aremore accessible.
Choose Properties More Carefully
Financing follows the laws of supply and demand. When money is
tight, banks can afford to pick and choose the people they decideto loan money to. As a result, they’re going to be very picky aboutwhich deals they finance and which ones they reject when theystart crunching the numbers.
You need to adjust accordingly by selecting properties more care-
fully. Overestimate costs, underestimate profits, and make sure theworst-case scenario still leaves you with a reasonable profit or pos-itive cash flow. When the market’s in a slump, you have less roomfor error.
Don’t gamble on declining areas or areas where unemployment is
rising. Stick with “bread-and-butter” properties that are easy to fixup, maintain, and rent out. Of course, it’s not wise to buy into abooming market, and we’re not telling you to do that, either. Buyingwhen the market is down can be a savvy move, but opt for morestable areas and look for early signs of recovery before you go all in.
Focus on Foreclosures
As the economy slows, foreclosure rates gradually increase, but
just as the economy begins to recover, foreclosure rates tend tospike. The peak in foreclosure rates typically lags behind the slumpin the economy by about a year, because foreclosures take between7 and 12 months to process. When you’re in a slow economy, bigopportunities lie ahead.
When you’re hunting for bargains on homes, you have to go where
the best sales are happening. In a slow economy, follow the foreclo-sures. Foreclosures are one of the best ways to acquire propertiesat below-market value. For more about finding and buying foreclo-sure properties, check out Ralph and Joe’s 
Foreclosure Investing For
Dummies or Chip’s Cashing In on Pre-foreclosures and Short Sales
(both Wiley) .Part V: The Part of Tens 24625_422335-ch17.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 246Look for Short-Sale Opportunities
When foreclosures soar, lenders begin looking for opportunities to
minimize their losses, as well. Many lenders are even open to thepossibility of a 
short sale — accepting less than full payment of the
current balance on the mortgage.
Why would any lender accept less than the homeowner/borrower
owes? Because if lenders don’t settle for less, they stand to loseeven more by ending up with a bad loan on their books and ahouse they have to sell in a slumping market. A short sale limitstheir loss. With a good credit history and track record, you cannegotiate a low sales price and the financing all at the same time.
To identify short sale opportunities, network with homeowners and
real estate professionals in your area. Real estate agents, attorneys(especially foreclosure and divorce lawyers), mortgage brokers,and loan officers often know about families who are having troublemaking their mortgage payments. If you can negotiate a short saleon behalf of the homeowners, you may be able to purchase theproperty at a bargain basement price and still have a little moneyleft over to help the homeowners move on with their lives.
Never deal with the lenders’ regular customer service representa-
tives. They’re programmed to answer every question with a “no.”Track down the loss mitigation department. They have the abilityand interest in negotiating with you.
Buy REO Properties
If a bank follows through on a foreclosure, nobody buys the prop-
erty at auction, and the previous owners can’t redeem it (in juris-dictions that have a redemption period), the bank ends up with theproperty. These repo properties are commonly referred to as 
real
estate owned (REO) or bank owned properties.
In addition to getting stuck with a loan that’s not generating any
income, the bank has to invest more money to fix up the place andsell it — usually at a loss.
In most cases, banks prefer to clear the bad loan off their books
quickly, sell the property at a reasonable loss to an investor, andwash their hands of the deal. They may even be willing to financethe purchase for a qualified investor — turning a bad loan into aloan that generates revenue for the bank.Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Surviving a Credit Crunch 24725_422335-ch17.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 247In situations like these, the government also experiences an
increased inventory of REO properties .FHA has a lending program
specifically designed to allow investors to finance REOs. For more
information, go to www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/reo/mm/
mminfo.cfm .
During a credit crunch, consider ramping up your efforts to con-
nect with the REO departments at local and national banks. Theymay not be willing to finance your first deal, but after you proveyourself, they should be more willing to finance your next purchase.
Search for High-Equity Properties
In tough markets, creativity is king. Seek out sellers who have prop-
erties with a lot of equity. These sellers can be much more flexiblein structuring a deal and financing it themselves if they don’t needthe cash or have a huge mortgage payment tied to the property.
The advantage for them is tapping into a higher rate of return than
they can probably get from other investments (and it’s secured byan asset they’re familiar with — their property).
If the owner is reluctant to take back a mortgage or a land con-
tract, offer a lease-option agreement of your own to get control ofthe property. Take some time to fix it up, re-lease it out, or allowthe market to recover a bit and then refinance it or sell it yourself.
Shift from a Buy-Sell to 
a Buy-Hold Strategy
If you’ve been buying and selling properties (fix-and-flip), you may
find that strategy isn’t quite as lucrative when property values takea dive. Instead of sitting on the sidelines waiting for conditions toimprove, consider shifting to a buy-and-hold strategy — buy properties and lease them out, at least until the housing marketturns around.
By leasing the property, you can often ride out a slow market for a
year or two and then put the house up for sale. Real estate pricestend to recover after huge slumps, at least for good-quality proper-ties, and if you can afford to hold the property, rental income maycover your holding costs until the market recovers and you cansell the house for the price you want.Part V: The Part of Tens 24825_422335-ch17.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 248You can also structure a lease-option purchase, which provides an
opportunity to lock in a buyer now even though the sale occurs later.
Don’t leap into the leasing business blindly. If you’re going to shift
from selling to renting, know what you’re getting yourself into.Check your tenants’ references and rental history, and carefullyscreen your tenants. For more about renting out property, checkout 
Property Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Robert S.
Griswold (Wiley).
Team Up with Your 
Mortgage Broker
When the market’s soft, the economy is usually in a slump, and
people generally have less money to spend on housing. By teamingup with a mortgage broker or loan originator, you can often helpfirst-time home buyers secure the financing they need to purchasethe home. You don’t want to finance the purchase yourself (by offer-ing seller financing), because that ties up your money, but you canput prospective buyers in touch with your broker, who can assistthem in securing the financing they need to buy the property fromyou. By offering access to financing, you often gain an edge in a slowmarket over other sellers who don’t have the vision or the close rela-tionship with a broker to make the sale happen.
Even during a credit crunch, financing is still available at attractive
terms for first-time homebuyers. Get familiar with FHA and ruraldevelopment (RD) loans to get buyers in for as little as 0 percentdown. Rural development loans are available through the USDAand offer 100 percent financing for development in rural areas. (SeeChapter 9 for more about USDA financing.)
Offer Your Agent a Bonus
If you need to sell a property in a slow market, consider offering
your agent a bonus for selling the property by a certain date. Inslow markets, some investors make the mistake of trying to negoti-ate a 
lower commission with their agent. They reason that the
agent needs the work and that the commission is another expense
that eats into their profits.
This strategy often backfires, however. The agent feels insulted and
unmotivated, and the house lingers on the market. The investorloses more money in holding costs than she gains by reducing theagent’s commission.Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Surviving a Credit Crunch 24925_422335-ch17.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 249To increase buyer traffic, consider raising the commission so you
can pay more in commissions to the buyer’s agent. For example, if
your agent typically charges you a 6 percent commission and splitsthe commission 50/50 if another agent delivers the buyer, offeryour agent 7 percent so she can afford to offer a bigger commis-sion to the buyer’s agent.
Don’t advertise a higher sales commission on the Multiple Listing
Service (MLS) or your other marketing materials, because you mayturn off prospective buyers who equate their agents’ enthusiasmwith the fat bonus you’re offering. Instead, work through your agentto communicate this boost in commission to the buyers’ agents.
Partner Up and Get Creative
When a market turns south, it generally affects everyone. During a
credit crunch, investors get more conservative, just like the banks.One solution is to team up with other investors and spread the risk.
Join a local real estate investors club, attend meetings, and meet
some fellow investors. Find out what they’re looking for and offerto partner up on a property to share the risk. Taking on two otherpartners diminishes your risk by 67 percent. Of course, you haveto share the rewards as well, but this method is a great way toacquire several properties and minimize your exposure to a declin-ing marketplace.
Get a written agreement between all the partners in advance — a
bad market magnifies assumptions and misunderstandings ifthings go wrong. For more about partnering, check out Chapter 13.Part V: The Part of Tens 25025_422335-ch17.qxp  3/11/09  11:56 AM  Page 250Appendix

 Preface  
 
 
I taught Money & Bankin g and International Finance several  times, and I convert ed my 
lecture notes int o a textbook.  Consequently, instructors can  use this  textbook for course s in 
Money &  Banking, or International Finance  or some hybrid in between them . Furthermore, 
financial analysts and e conomists could refer to  this book as a study guide  because  this book 
contains  concise information , and all facts and analysis are  straight to the point , explaining  how 
governments and central banks influence the exchange rates, the interest rates, and currency 
flows.  
The Financial Crisis severely impacted the world’s financ ial markets that are still felt in 
2014 . I included many examples from the 2008 Fi nancial Crisis, when many U.S. banks and 
financial institutions teetered on bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the financial crisis has not  ended, 
and it  continue s affect ing the world’s economies and  financial markets .

 1. Money and the Financia l System  
This chapter introduces the financial system. Students will learn the purpose of financial 
markets and its relationship to financial institutions. Financial institutions connect the savers to 
the borrowers through financial int ermediation. At the heart of every  financial system lies  a 
central bank. It  controls a nation’s m oney, and the money supply is a  vital component of the 
economy. Unfortunately, economists have trouble in defining money  because people can 
convert many financial instruments into  money . Thus, central banks use several definitions to 
measure the money supply . Furthermore, if an economy did  not use money, then peop le would 
resort to  an inefficient system  – barter . Unfortunately, this society would produce a limited 
number of goods a nd services. Nevertheless, money overcomes the inherent problems with a 
barter system and allows specialization to occur at many levels.  
Financial Markets  
Money and the financial system are intertwined and cannot be separated. They both 
influence and affec t the whole economy, such as the inflation rate, business cycles, and interest 
rates. Consequently, consumers, investors, sa vers, and government officials w ould make better -
infor med decisions if they understood  how the financial markets and money supply in fluence 
the economy.  
A financial market  brings buyers and sellers  face to face to buy and sell bonds, stocks, and 
other financial instruments. Buyers of fina ncial securities invest  their savings, while sel lers of 
financial securities borrow  funds. A financ ial market could  occupy  a physical location like the 
New York Stock Exchange where buyers and sellers co me face -to-face, or a market could  be 
like NASDAQ where computer networks connect buyers and seller s together . 
A financial institution  links  the savers and borrowers  with the most common being  
commercial banks. For example, if you deposited $100 into your savings account, subsequently, 
the bank could lend this $100 to a borrower. Then the borrower pays interest to the bank. In 
turn, the bank would pay int erest to you for using your funds. Bank’s profits reflect  the 
difference between the interest rate charged to the borrower and the interest rate  the bank pays 
to you for  your savings account.  
Why would someone deposit money at a bank instead of directly bu ying securities through 
the financial markets? A bank, bei ng a financial institution,  provide s three benefits to the 
depositor. First, a bank collects information  about borrowers  and lends to borrowers  with a low 
chance of defaulting on their loans. Thus, a bank’s specialty  is to rate  its borrowe rs. Second, the 
bank reduces  your investment risk. Bank lends to a v ariety of borrowers, such as  home 
mortgages, business loans, and credit cards. If one business bankrupts or several customers do 
not p ay their cred it cards, then the default does not financially harm  the bank. Bank would  earn 
interest income on its other investments  that offset the bad loans . Finally, a  bank deposit has 
liquidity. If people have  an emergency and need  money from their bank deposit s, they c an easily 
convert the  bank deposit into cash  quickly . Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
11 
 Economists use l iquidity to define  money. Liquidity  is people can easily convert an asset 
into cash with little transaction costs. For example, if you take all your assets and list them in 
terms of liquidity, then l iquidity forms a scale as shown  in Figure 1. Cash is the most liquid 
asset because a person already has money and does not need to convert it to money . 
Subsequently, a savings account is almost as good as cas h because customers can  arrive at  a 
bank  or ATM  and convert their deposits into cash quickly with little transaction costs. 
Nevertheless, cars and houses are the least liquid assets because owners require time and  high-
transaction costs to convert these assets into cash.  
 
  
Figure  1. Ranking assets by li quidity  
 
Economists define the money  or the money supply  as anything that people pay for goods 
and services or repay  debts. In developing countries, people  use cash as money . In countries 
with sophisticated financial markets like the United States  and Euro pe, the definition of money 
becomes  complicated  because m oney  includes  liquid assets, such as cash, checking accoun ts, 
and savings accounts. P eople can convert these assets  into cash with little t ransaction costs. 
Consequently, economists include h ighly liquid assets in  the definition s of money. However, 
economists never include asset s such as houses  in the defini tion of money. Unfortunately, 
homeowners need time and have  high-transaction cost s to convert a house int o cash. Many 
homeowners will n ot sell their homes quickly by selling it for a lower value than the  home’s 
market value . 
Central Banks  
Every country uses  money. Therefore, every country has a government institution that 
measures and influences the money supply. Thi s institution is the central bank . For example, 
the central bank for the United States is the Federal Reserve System , or commonly referred to as 
the “ Fed.” The Federal Reserve regulates banks, grants  emergency loans to banks, and 
influences the money supply. Since the money suppl y and the financial markets are intertwined, 
the Fed can influence financial markets indirectly, when it affects the money supply. Therefore, 
the Fed can indirectly affect the interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, and the output growth 
rate of the U.S . economy. When the Fed manage s the money supply to influence the economy, 
economists call this monetary policy . Consequently,  this whole book explains how a central 
bank  can influence the economy and its  financial markets . Furthermore, readers can  extend this 
analysis to any central bank in the world.  
Central bank  influences three key  variables in the economy, which are:  
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
12 
 Variable 1: Inflation  is a sustained rise in the average prices for goods and services of an 
economy. When a central bank increases the m oney supply, it can create  inflat ion. For example, 
if you place  $100 in a shoe box and bury it in your yard for one year. That $100 loses  value over 
time because, on average, all the prices for goods and service s in an economy continually rise  
every year. If the inflation ra te rises 2% per year, the n after one year, that $100 would  buy on 
average, 2% fewer goods and services. Although inflation erodes the value of money, a low 
inflation rate is no t necessarily bad because it might  indicate economic growth.  
Variable 2:  A business cycle  means the economy is experienci ng strong economic growth, 
and economists measure the s ize of the economy by  the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) . GDP 
reflects  the total value of goods and services produced within an economy fo r one  year. When 
businesses boost  production, they produce more  goods and services  within th e economy. If GDP 
grows  quickly, then the economy experiences  a business cycle. Thus, consumers’ incomes are 
rising; businesses experience strong sales and rising profit s, and workers can easily find new 
jobs, which decrease the unemployment rate. However, if  the money supply grows too quickly , 
then inflation can strike an economy  with rapidly rising prices . 
Variable 3: Interest rates  reflect  the cost of borrowing money. People borrow money to 
buy cars, houses, appliances, and computers while busine sses borrow to build factories and to 
invest in machines and equipment,  expand ing production. Moreover, governments borrow 
mone y when they spend mo re than  they collect in taxes. Since economies with c omplex 
financial markets create  many forms of loans , these loans have different interest rates. Usually 
economists refer to “the interest rate, ” because interest rates  move together. As a central bank 
expands the money supply , the interest rates  fall, and vice versa , which we prove  later in this 
book. Thus, a n increasing money supply causes  interest rates to fall  in the short run.  
One important function  of monetary policy is to create economic growth. Unf ortunately, the 
GDP can grow  slowly or  decrease as  businesses produce fewer goods and services within the 
economy , while  consumers’ incomes fall or stagnate . When an economy produces fewer goods 
and services, then unemployed workers have more difficulties in finding jobs. Subsequently the 
unemployment rate increases, and the economy enters a recession. Unfortunately, if the money 
supply grows too s lowly, or even contracts, it could  cause the economy to enter a recession.  
Economis ts calculate both the nomina l GDP and  real GDP. Nominal GDP  includes the 
impact of inflation . For example, i f economy  experiences inflation, or firms produce more goods 
and service s during a year , then the nominal GDP rises . On the other hand, economists can 
remo ve the effects of inflation by calculating  real GDP . When the real GDP increases, it means 
firms in society  have  produ ced more goods and services while inflati on does  not affect  real 
GDP. Tha t way, if real GDP is rising , then the public and economists know the economy is 
expanding, while a decreasing real GDP indicates a society's economy is contracting. Finally, 
economists define  many variables in  real or nominal  terms , such as interest rates and wage rates , 
which we explain later in this book . Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
13 
 Barter and Functions of Money  
If an economy did not use money, what would it look l ike? Without money, the  buyers  
would exchange goods with the sellers by exchanging one good for another good , which we call  
barter . Unfortunately, barter has many problems.  
Problem 1:  Barter suffers fro m a double coincidence of wants . For example, if y ou 
produce shoes and want to drink a  Coca -Cola, then you search for a person who produces Cola -
Cola and needs s hoes. Thus, you  need to search for  a person who wants the opposite of you , 
which could take a long time . 
Problem 2:  Many goods, like fruits and vegetables, deteriorate  and rot  over time. Growers 
of perishable g oods could not store  their purchasing power.  They would need to exch ange their 
products for goods  that would not perish quickly if they want  to save.  
Problem 3:  Products and se rvices do not have a common measurement for prices. For 
instance, if a store stocked  1,000 products and money circulated with this economy, 
subsequently, this store would  have 1,000 price tags. Then  customers can  compare  products  
easily . With barter and no money, this same store would have 499,500 price exchange ratios  as 
calculated in Equation 1. Variable E indicates  the number of price ratios while n is the number 
of products produced in a barter system.  
 
499,50021nn=E 
2999 000,1       (1) 
 
A price ratio shows the amount of one  good that buyers and sellers exchange  for another 
good, and we show examples of price ratios  in Figure 2. For example, a person could exchange  
one apple for 3 bananas  or two Coca -Colas.  
 
1 apple = 3 bananas  
2 Coca -Colas = 1 apple  
  . 
  . 
1 cup of coffee = 1 Coca -Cola  
Figure  2. Example s of price ratios  
 
Problem 4:  Business people would have trouble  writing contracts for future p ayments of 
goods and services under  a barter system. Consequ ently, a bart er society would  produce a 
limited number of goods and services.  
Money eliminates many problems with barter and has four functions. First function of 
money is a medium of exchange  because people use money to pay for goods and services and 
repay  debts. Medium of exchange function promotes efficienc y and specialization . For example, 
the author teaches economics . Under a barter system, the author would search a market 
extensiv ely to find a person who would exchange  goods and services that th e author needs . In Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
14 
 the author’s case, he could experience  considerable search costs for people wanting economics 
instruction. With money, the author does what he does best and teaches for money. Then he  
takes this money to the market  and buys goods and services that he wants . This function of 
money allows the specialization of labor  to occur and eliminates the problem of double 
coincidence of wants under a barter system.  
Second function of money is a unit of account . Money conveniently allows people to place 
specific values o n goods and services. For example, a two -liter of Coca -Cola costs $0.89 while 
Pepsi costs $0.99. T hus, customers can compare product s’ prices  easily . This function is 
extremely important for businesses because business people place values on buildings, 
machines, computers, and other assets. Then they record this information into financial 
statements. Subsequently, investors read the financial  statements and  gauge which companies 
are profitable. Finally, this function of money eliminates the massive number o f price exchang e 
ratios that would occur under  a barter system.  
Third function of money is the store of value . Money must  retain its value. For example, if 
a two -liter of Coca -Cola costs $0.99 today, then it should cost $0.99 tomorrow. Unfortunately, 
inflation erodes the “store of value” of money. As the price level increases, the value of money 
decreases because each unit of money buys fewer goods and services. Inflation causes 
consumers to lose their purchasing power  over time. If the inflation rate becom es too high, then 
money as a “medium of exchange” breaks down too. In countries with  high inflation rates, 
people resort to  barter and immediately exc hange their local money for  stable money, such as 
euros or U.S. dollars. Howev er, people must use  money as  a medium of exchange because 
government laws legally require people to accept money as a means of payment to re pay a debt 
or to pay taxes. The  legal requirement is “ legal tender .” On the other hand, bank checks are not 
legal tender, and people and busines ses can reject checks as payment.  
Fourth and final function of money is the standard of deferred payment . This function 
combines the “medium of exchange” and “unit of account” of money because contracts state 
debts in terms of a “unit of account ” and borrowers repay using the  “medium of exchange.” 
Hence, this function of money is extremely important for bu siness transactions that  occur in the 
future. Businesses and people can borrow or lend money bas ed on future transactions that  create 
the financial m arkets.  
Money needs six desirable properties for people and businesses to use money, which are:  
 
1. Acceptable: Businesses and public accept money as payment for goods and services. People 
must trust  money in order to accept it for payment.  
2. Standardized quali ty: Same units of money must have  the identical size, quali ty, color, so 
people know  what they are getting. If a government issued money in d ifferent sizes and 
colors, how w ould people determine  whether bills are legitimate or  counterfeit?  
3. Durable:  Money m ust be physically sturdy, or it might  lose its value quickly  as it degrades 
and falls apart . In some countries, people do  not accept torn, ripped, or faded mone y. Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
15 
 4. Valuable relative to its weight:  People can easily carry large amoun ts of money around 
conven iently  and use it in transactions.  
5. Divisible:  Public can break money down into sma ller units to purchase inexpensive  goods 
and services.  
All modern countries use coins and paper bills as money, which possess the five desirable 
properties. Total v alue of pa per bills and coins equals  currency . Furthermore, people become 
psychologically dependent on a cur rency because they use  a particular currency for a long time. 
For example, U.S. citizens have used dollars as their currency  for two centuries. If the U. S. 
government wanted to introduce  a new currency with a different name, then the public could  
reject the ne w currency . 
Forms of Money  
People  since the dawn of civilization created payment  systems. Thus, m oney facilitates 
business transactions, and the payment  system becomes the mechanism to settle  transactions. 
First and oldest payment system  is commodity money. Commodity money  is government selects  
one commodity from  society to be come  money, such as gold or silver. If society did not use 
gold or silver as mon ey, then people still use the  commodity  for other purposes . People use gold 
in jewelry, teeth fillings, electrical wires, or the pins of a microprocessor.  Commodity money 
could be anything. For example, prisoners use cigarettes as money in U.S. prisons, wh ile people 
accepted vodka and bullets a s payment  in remote parts of Russia during the 1990s . 
Commodity money could be full-bodied money . Its value as a good in non -money purpose s 
equals its value as a m edium of exchange. For instance , if the market value o f one ounce of gold 
is $1,000 , and the government made one -ounce gold coins, then the face value of the coin would 
equal $1,000. Thus, this coin represents  full-bodied commodity money  because the c oin's 
inherent value equals the coin's market value.   
Governments discovered a  trick about commodity money. What would happen  if a 
governmen t made one -ounce gold coins with a face value equaled to $2,000 while  the coin 
contained $1,000  of gold ? Subsequently,  a government had created  $1,000  out of thin air! 
Government can create  value by “printing money ,” which we call  seigniorage , and government 
could receive  significant revenue by creating money .  
Government can debas e its currency by relying  on seigniorage. For example, the Roman 
government “printed money” by recallin g its gold and silver coins. This  it re-minted  more coins 
that contained less gold and silve r by adding cheap metals . In the beginning of the ancient 
Roman Empire, coins were alm ost pure gold  and silver, while , towards the end of  the empire, 
Roman coins contained specks of gold and silver. For example, government can  debase coins. If 
government issued one -ounce, gold coins for $1,000 , and the coins were 98% pure gold, then 
governm ent can print money by collecting the old coins and mint two new coins with a value of 
$1,000 that only contain 49% gold. Then government fills the remaining 51% of the coin with 
cheap metals.  Unfortuna tely, government could create extremely h igh inflation  rates if it 
depends on seigniorage  too much.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
16 
 Second form of commodity money is representative full -bodied money . This money has 
little inherent value, such as paper bills, but people can convert the money into a valuable 
commodity, such as gold and  silver . For example, if you possessed  U.S. dollar bills  before 1933 , 
you could exchange the bills for gold at the U.S. government’s exch ange rate of $20 per gold 
ounce . Most of humanity  used commodity money before the 20th century until government and 
central banks had replaced it with fi at money . 
Governments and central banks created the second payment system, fiat money , and it is a  
20th century  creation . Most central banks in the world tod ay use f iat money . In the United 
State s, the Federal Reserve System has the authority to issue  U.S. dollars, and the publi c cannot 
use this money for any thing else. Furthermore, the people cannot exchange U.S. dollars for 
another commodity from govern ment.  For example, if people do  not want to use U.S. dollar bills 
as money, it has no other function other than being fancy paper. Unfortunately, no authority can 
limit  the amount of money the Federal Reserve System can issue. If the Fed wants  to inject an 
additional $1 trillion i nto the economy, it could  do so  easily . However, a rapid  expansion in the 
money supply c ould be drastic to an economy. For in stance, countries with  high inflation rates  
or hyperinflation have  rapidly growing money supplies. Hyperinflati on is a country’s inflation 
rate becomes extremely high, and prices become meaningless. Subsequently, people stop using  
money, and they resort to barter. We show a  100-trillion Zimbabwe note  in Figure 3. A noble 
prize laureate in economics, Milton Friedman , stated, “Inflation is always and everywhere a 
monetary phenomenon.”  
 
 
Figure  3. One -hundred -trillion Zimbabwe note  
 
Third payment  syste m, a check , is credit money  tied to a person’s checking account. Banks, 
credit unions, and other financial institutions offer checking accounts to people and businesses. 
Then people use checks as a medium of exchange, allowing them to pu rchase goods and 
services. Once seller s accept  a check,  they present  the check to a bank for payment. 
Consequently, c hecks have three benefits. First, p eople and businesses do not  carry cash. 
Second, the check provides proof of a business transaction. Finally, checks become  convenient 
in large transac tions, such as buying a house  or car. Buyer does not need to carry  a suitcase of 
cash for this  transaction. However, checks create two problems. F irst, the financial institution 
charge s fees for using checks, or the check writer s abuse  their account s and w rite fraudulent 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
17 
 checks for amount s that exceed  their account  balances . Some businesses and people do not 
accept checks  because  they cannot verify if a  person has sufficient funds in his account.  
Checks  evolved into the last payment  system – electronic funds . The most common form 
being  debit card s. A debit card  improve s the payments system ’s efficiency  and extends the 
function  of checks . Many retail and grocery stores allow consumers to  pay for goods and 
services using  a debit card.  When customers purcha se their goods and services, they use  a 
plastic card that contains either  a chip or magnetic strip. Next, the store has machines that read 
the chip or magnetic  strip and allow  the store to transfer s funds electronically from the 
customer’s checking account to the store’s bank account. Consequently, t he debit card reduces 
the uncertainty  the customer s have sufficient funds in their account for business  transaction s. 
Although many businesse s do not accept checks, they do  accept debit cards.  
Debit cards expanded electronic funds leading to the automated teller machine (ATM)  and 
the internet . Automated teller machine (ATM)  allows people to withdraw cash from machines 
that are located at banks, grocery stores, shopping malls, a nd gas stations. ATMs are connected 
together through computer networks, and one o f the largest networks is Visa Debit. The Visa  
network allows customers to access their checking and savings accounts at financial institutions 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from almost every c ity in the United States, and many  foreign 
countries around the world. Finally, people can buy products and services, transfer bank funds, 
or pay utility bills by sitting behind a computer screen . They only need a computer connection to 
the internet  to transfer money or pay bills . 
Bitcoin s 
The internet created a new money that exists  only in cy berspace. We call this money 
Bitcoin , where b it refers to the computer term – a piece of information,  either a one or zero. This 
money has other names including v irtual money or cryptocur rency.   
No central bank or government issues Bitcoins, and 11.75 million Bitcoins were circulating 
in the world in October 2013. Bitcoins’ supply continuously grows until  2140, st opping at 21 
million Bitcoins. Furthermore, c ryptography plays a key role in Bitcoins. Every Bitcoin has a 
unique, encrypted number  that only a Bitcoin operator can decrypt . A person opens an account 
or wallet and can buy Bitcoins from online vend ors. A person can store his Bitcoins on his 
computer or cellphone or use an online wallet.  
A person does not  have to  reveal  his identity. Then he or she  settle s transactions by sen ding 
the other party his Bitcoin  information. As a buyer completes a transa ction, software encrypts 
that person’s private key into the transaction along with the Bitcoin number. A private key is 
like a person’ s bank account number . Ensuring people do not spend the same Bitcoin for 
multiple transactions , a miner completes  the tran saction. A miner decrypts the transaction and 
records it in a ledger. Then it re -issues the Bitcoin to the seller.  A miner can earn transaction 
fees and receives newly created Bitcoins by clearing transactions.  
Miner is not the proper terminology . A miner functions as a  clearing house . A 
clearing house  can be  a large bank that helps member banks transfer money between them. Then 
member banks have accounts at the clearing house . For example, you buy $500 in clothes  from 
an internet store and send a check to the seller. Next, the seller deposits the check into his or he r Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
18 
 bank  account. Seller’s bank sends information about  the check  to the clearing house  and the 
clearing house  checks with your bank. Your bank checks you r balance ensuring you have enough 
funds in the account to pay the check. Once your bank approves the transaction, the 
clearinghouse reduces the account for your bank  by $500 and adds $500 to the account for the 
seller’s bank. Then your bank reduces your a ccount by $500 while the seller’s bank adds $500 
to his or her account , thus clearing the transaction . 
Bitcoins have four drawbacks  that would prevent wide scale adoption.  
 
1. People who deposit their savings into banks have deposit insu rance. If their bank f ails, the 
deposit insurance  guarantees the depositors will not lose their money . The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation insures bank deposits  up to $250,000  for U.S. banks . However, no 
government agency insures Bitcoin or protects people from losses.  
2. Hackers can break into online wallets and steal  the Bitcoins. Since all transactions are 
electronic, they can erase  history , and people may not  recover their stolen Bitcoins .  
3. Price of Bitcoin fluctu ates greatly between $80 and $1,00 0, which we show in Figu re 4. For 
people to use and accept money, people must know the  money ’s value . Some investors 
purchased Bitcoins , hoping to buy at a low price and sell for a high price.  
4. Few sellers accept Bitcoins as payment.

Figure 4. The Bitcoin’s value  
 
Bitcoins provide  three  benefits. First, buyers and sellers do not have to reveal their identities  
to each other . They can remain secret. Second, people can use Bitcoin to launder or smuggle 
currency outside a country. A buyer  would purchase Bitcoins in one country and withdraw the 
Bicoins in another country, circumventing currency controls. Finally, buyers and sellers use 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
19 
 Bitcoins to settle tra nsactions in the under ground economy that is hidden within  the internet. We 
call this the deep internet where most internet users would never see. The deep internet allows 
buyers and sellers to communicate with each other without revealing their location or identities.  
Bitcoin is evolving into the currency of the black markets on the inte rnet. Buyers and sellers 
use Bitcoin like the  numbered Swiss bank accounts. For example, t hey open  a numbered 
account  at a Swiss bank  that contains no personal information. Then they can use the account to 
settle transact ions secretly. For example, a person pays for an illegal service. This  person 
contacts the Swiss bank and asks the bank to transfer the bribe amount from his b ank account 
into the seller’s bank account. This  person gives the banker a code (or private key for Bitcoin) to 
approve the transfer . Consequently, the t ransaction remains secret because no one has revealed 
his or her identities . 
U.S. federal government is cracking down on the internet black market and is closing down 
Bitcoin operators. Agents believe that if they can shut  down the mon ey, they can eliminate  the 
black  markets operating in the deep  Internet  or prevent the funding of terrorists . For example, 
the U.S. Department of Ho meland Security shut down Mt Gox , the largest Bitcoin operator in 
the United States in May 2013  although Mt Gox did not participate in illegal activities . U.S. law 
requires all money exchangers to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcem ent Network.  
Unfortunately, the federal government will fail because people can use Bitcoins anywhere in the 
world.  
Bitcoin continues to flourish despite its drawbacks and U.S. government crackdown. 
Bitcoin ATMs are cropping up in Hong Kong, New York City, and Vancouver, and more stores 
and vendors are accepting Bitcoins for payment.  
Money Supply Definitions  
Economists use two  approaches in defining  the mone y sup ply: transaction and liquidity.  If 
economists  use the transaction approach , they  emphasize the money’s function as a medium of 
exchange. Only a few assets possess this property. As the central bank boosts  the money suppl y, 
people raise  their spending that boosts  national output, increases income, reduces 
unemplo yment, and create s inflation . 
If economists use the liquidity approach , they  take all asset s, rank them by  liquidity , and 
include only  liquid  assets  in the money s upply because people can easily sell these assets at a 
future time at a known price with minimum costs . This approach emphasizes money’s function 
as a “store of value,” because if  highly  liquid asset s retain  their value, people can easily use the 
assets  to purchase goods and services directly or indirectly. Why does this approach work? 
When the central bank boosts  the money supply, people will adjust t heir portfolios of assets, 
affecting  consumer spending, national output, income, and employment.  
The Federa l Reserve System defines money supply as M1, M2, M3, and L. Many central 
banks in the world measure their money supply similarly to United States. However, the y differ 
which financial instruments  they include  in their measures . Every country uses different  
financial instrume nts because countries differ in their  legal system s, regulations of  financial 
markets , and customs.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
20 
 Economists define the M1 as the narrowest definition of money supply because they  use the 
trans action approach to determine which financi al instruments to include . M1 adds  the follow ing 
three items  together:  
 
 Currency held by the public and in bank vaults. It excludes currency held by the 
government.  
 All forms of checking accounts.  
 Traveler’s Checks that are held by people and not by the ba nks. 
Economists define the M2 as a broader definition than M1 because they use the liquidity 
approach to define  the money supply. Economists add the following together for M2: 
 
 Include everything in  M1. 
 Include all small denomination savings deposits and t ime accounts at all financial 
institutions. Small denomination in the U.S. means the bank account has  a balance less 
than a $100,000 . Examples include  Certificates of Deposit or s avings accounts at banks.  
Economists define M3 broader  than M2  and include the following items summed together:  
 
 Include  everything from M2.  
 Include large denomination savings and time accounts, and liquid securities with longer 
investment time s than the financia l instruments included in M2. For  example , a corporation  
holds  a $1 million Certificate of Deposit.  
Economists define L for liquidity  as the broadest measure of the money supply and include  
all liquid assets. The Federal Reserve does  control this measure. L sums the following items  
together.  
 
 Include everything from M3.  
 Include  all short -term securities, such as Treasury Bills issued by the U.S. Federal 
governm ent. (Refer to Chapter 2 for examples  of short -term securities).  
The Fed stopped publishing the M3 definition of the money supply on March 23, 2006. It 
stated M3 do es not provide any useful purpose, and  the Fed does not use  M3 in formulating 
monetary policy. Some international investors believe the Fed stopped publishing M3  because  
some people fear a U.S. dollar collapse on the international markets  because the United States 
suffers from large trade deficits and a massive national government debt . (We discuss  these Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
21 
 issues  in Chapter 5 ). The M3 definition contains the amount of U.S. dollars held outside the 
United States.  
Which  definition of the money  supply  is the best ? Four monetary aggregates grow at 
different rates, at different times, and even in different directions. Before 1981, a stable 
relationship existed between M1 and GDP, but the government had begun  deregulating  the 
financial marke ts duri ng the 1970s and early 1980s,  obscuring  this relationship. Currently, many 
economists use the M2 definition of the money supply to explain changes in the GDP, inflat ion, 
and employment. Accordingly , the Fed does not formulate M1  targe ts and concentrates on  M2 
instead.

 2. Overview of the U.S. Financial System  
This chapter exp lains how financial markets link the savers to the  borrowers. Savers can use  
two separate  channels t o lend to borrowers. F irst, the savers  could deposit their funds into a 
financial institution that in turn, lends to the borrower s. Second, savers could lend d irectly to the 
borrowers by  direct ly investing  in financial securities. Thus, these two channels create a variety  
of financial markets, such as the spot and derivative markets, and primary and secondary 
markets. Furthermore, we examine the impact of financial innovation and  government  
regulation of th e financial markets . Finally , we define  the c ommon financial instruments  at the 
end of the chapter  that we will use  for the rest of the book.  
The U.S. banking system evolved into  a complex system. As the United States was forming, 
the public and the government  distrust ed large, powerful banks. Consequently, the government 
passed laws that heavily r egulated t he banking system, enlarging  the number of U.S. banks and 
shrinking  the banks’ asset size . Moreover, the United States created  two layers of commercial 
banks:  national and state banks. Several government agencies at the fede ral and/or state level 
regulate t hese banks. Consequently, banks  have used  ingenious methods and innovation s to 
circumvent government s’ regulations.  
Financial Intermediation  
A financial system  transfers funds from savers  to borrowers . Savers and borrowers can be 
anyone . Some households, businesses,  and governments are net savers because  they spend less 
than their income , and t hey become the source of loans  while o ther households, businesses, and 
governments are net borrowers.  They spend more than their inco mes. For example, many 
college students are net borrowers.  Students’ income s are usually lower than their yearly 
expenses , and they use student loans to pay  for the difference.  After graduation,  the students 
enter the workforce , and they start  repaying their student loans.  As their income s continually 
rise over time, the former students repay  their loans and become net savers, saving funds for 
retirement.  Using  another example , many local and state governments h ave laws, requiring them 
to balance their  budgets.  This fiscal responsibility forces  many local and state governments in 
the United States to be net save rs while the U.S. f ederal government has bee n a net borrower for 
the last 50  years.  
Transfer of funds from savers to borrowers is vital to an eco nomy. If the borrowers invest 
the funds by purchasing machines and equipment, the borrowers can produce more goods and 
services. When businesses produce more goods and services, subsequently, the economy grows, 
and a growing economy creates jobs and rising  incomes. As consumers experience rising 
incomes, they buy more goods and services, increasing the living standards. Beauty in the U.S. 
financial system is the financial institutions can collect and concentrate the meager savings of 
many people and then le nd to a large company. For instance, 10,000 savers who have $200 in 
their savings accounts could allow a financial institution to grant a business loan for $2 million. Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
24 
 Subsequently, the business can invest new machines and equipment, boosting its productio n 
level, and creating economic growth.  
Savers link  to the borrowers through two routes : financial intermediaries  and direct finance . 
Common financial intermediaries  include  banks, mutual funds, and insurance companies.  For 
example, you purchased fire insur ance for your home.  When you pay your premium,  the 
insurance company invests  your payment into the financial markets  by investing  in financial 
securities . Financial intermediaries only provide this function for one reason – to earn profits.  
For instance , banks transfer your funds to borrowers to earn profits.  Banks earn  profit s from the 
difference between the interest rate paid by the borrowers and the interest rate the bank pays on 
your accounts.  
Second route links  savers to the borrowers through direct f inance . Net savers, like 
households, can lend directly to businesses through the financial markets.  Two broadly defined 
financial instruments are common stock and bonds.  If you buy common stock , you own  shares 
of a corporation  that we call  equity . We show an example of a stock ce rtificate  in Figure 1 . 
Moreover, stockholders have the right to vote on certain corporate policies and elect the Board 
of Directors.  Each share of stock entitles the owner  to one vote.  For example, i f you own ed 100 
shares o f stock , and this corporation issued  a million shares, your vote would  have a small  
impact on corporate policy.  Finally , the stockholders earn  a share of the profits,  which we call  
dividends .  
Second financial instrument is a bond . A bond consists of  a standardized loan to a 
corporation . A bond is fancy paper givi ng bondholders legal rights where  the corporation 
promises to repay a long -term loan plus interest to the bondholders.  If a corporation bankrupts 
and is  liquidated, bondholders have a higher priority  and claim  on the corporation’s assets, while 
the common stockholder s come  last.

Figure 1. An example of a stock certificate  
 
Bonds and stocks have two markets:  the primary market  and second market . A corporation  
or government issues brand -new securities in the primary market  by selling them directly to 
security dealers.  Thus, they sell new securities  in the primary market, while investors sell and 
buy existing securities in the secondary market . Most famous secondary market  for stock is the 
New York Stock Exchange.  This exchange allows i nvestors to buy and to sell existing stock for 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
25 
 the United States largest corporations. Furthermore, s econdary markets are important  because  
these markets increase the li quidity of financial instruments.  Investors can easily sell or buy 
financial securities on secondary markets.  Moreover, when government or corporations issue 
new securities, the prices from the secondary market set the prices for the new securities  in the 
primary market . 
Why would savers  deposit their money into banks, instead of investing directly into the 
financial markets?  Financial intermediaries provide three functions.  First, your bank account has  
liquidity . If an emergency arises, you can easily with draw funds from your account.  If you  
purchased stock and bonds from the financial markets, you could experience time delays and 
pay a transaction cost to withdraw yours money . Second, financial intermediaries have 
specialist s who collect  information  about borrowers.  Financial intermediaries lend to bo rrowers 
who are not likely to  defaul t on their loan s. Finally, the financial intermediaries reduce the  risk. 
They lend to a variety of borrowers through a process called diversification . For example, banks 
will issue credit car ds, grant mortgages, lend  to a variety of businesses, and buy U.S. 
government securities.  If several cre dit card holders default, a couple of  households stop paying 
their mortgages, or a  business bankrupts  and defaults on a bank loan, over all, the banks could 
still earn profits  because  the majority of bank customers are repaying their loans.  On the other 
hand, i f you directly invested in a company that bankrupts, then you  could  lose all of your 
investment.  
Savers could withdraw their money out of the financial intermediaries and invest directly in 
the financial markets, such as buying U.S. government securities . We  call this process – 
financial disintermediation . Savers have two reasons to invest  directly  in government.  First, a 
government m ay pay  a higher interest rate than a bank.  For example, y our savings account earns 
2% interest  while  a U.S. Treasury bill  pays 4% interest.  Thus, the investors want to earn the 
greater interest rate. Second, the U.S. government has a low risk of default  because  the 
government has the power to tax and “print” money (i.e. seigniorage).  If the government 
experiences  financial trouble, it can raise taxes, issue more government securities, or print 
money.  One problem does occur.  If a government accumulates  a mas sive debt, it usually gets 
money for loans first , while b usinesses  come second.  If investors have limited funds, then the 
businesses might not get the money that they need for investing in machines and equipment.  
Consequently, a  large government debt could  impact  the financial markets and hamper business 
investment  because  a large government debt crowds out private investment.  For example, the 
U.S. government debt has exceeded $17 trillion in  2014. If the U.S. government had a debt of  
zero dollars, then the  investors would invest their funds in the private markets.  
Financial markets have two methods to complete a transaction.  Up to this point, you 
assumed when a buyer and seller co mpleted a financial transaction,  they exchange money  for 
the financial instrum ent immediately . We call this the cash market  or spot market . However, 
buyers and sellers have another option to complete a transaction.  Buyer and seller of a financial 
instrument can negotiate a price and quantity today, but they exchange money for the fi nancial 
instrument on a future specific date . These transactions occur in the derivative  market . For 
example, you negotiate a price today to buy 10 Treasury bills fr om a seller for $9,000 each in 
six months.  You had  entered  into a contract with the seller for a future transaction.  If these Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
26 
 contracts are  standardized , investors can  buy and sell these contracts on secondary markets.  We 
study t he derivatives marke t in Chapter 18 . 
Financial Instruments  
Every financial instrument, except stock, has a principal, interest, and maturity. Principal  is 
the loan amount the borrower received from the lender.  Then the borrower pays interest  as 
periodic payments  to the lender  because  the lender allows  the borrower  to use the funds. I nterest  
is a cost to the borrower, but income to the lender. Finally,  maturity  is the date the  security  
expires , or the final date  when the borrower pays the last pay ment for the principal plus  interest.  
Analysts and economists categor ize financial instruments  into two broadly defined classes: 
money market and capital market. Money market  comprise s of short -term securities with  a 
maturity less than one year. Money market securities are  popular and are simply a loan of funds 
from one party to another. Money market securities ar e highly liquid and almost as good as 
money – hence the name money market. Second category, th e capital market , include s long -
term securities with a maturity greater than a  year. Capital market includes common stock  
because  stock has no expiration date  because  the corporation, in theory, could live forever. 
Thus, we define stock as  a long -term security.  
You should  memorize the following securities  because  we continually refer  to these 
financial instruments  throughout  this book . For students to understand  these securities , 
remember  who issues the security , and whether it is a money market or capital market security. 
All these securities have one purpose. One party owes another party money plus i nterest  except 
stocks . Stocks represent ownership in a corporation and  are not  loans. 
Money market  securities have maturities less than one year , and  we list the common ones : 
 
 U.S. Treasury bills  or T-bills) are loans to the U.S. g overnment.  Maturities range from 15 
days to one  year.  T-bills do not  have an  interest rate  stamped on them , and the y start at  
$10,000.  If an investor buys  a T-bill for $19,000, and the T -bill has a face value of $20,000  
with a maturity of six  months . Then six months later, the government will pay $20,0 00. 
The $ 1,000 reflects the interest . 
 Commercial paper  is a loan to a well -known bank or corporation  for a short -time period.  
Corporations  use commercial paper to  raise funds  without issuing new stock s or bonds.  
Commercial paper is a form of direct finance , and the loan has no collateral.  
 Banker’s Acceptances  are used in  international trade.  For example, a  firm wants to buy 
from a foreign exporter.  Firm deposits money at a bank, and the bank guarantees payment 
by issuing a banker’s acceptance . That way, the export accepts the banker’s acceptance and 
ships the goods to the firm. If the firm does not deposit money at the bank and the bank 
guarante es payment, then the bank must  pay the foreign exporter, even if the firm 
bankrupts.  These sec urities are liquid  because  holders can sell them on a  secondary market.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
27 
  Negotiable Bank Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are loans to banks that banks sell directly 
to depositors.  CDs have a fixed time period.  If a depositor withdraws a  CD early, then the 
depositor  forfeits the interest.  Consequently, CDs usually pay a great er interest rate than a 
savings account.  
 Repurchase Agreements  (repos) are short -term loans.  For example, a bank sells T -bills to 
a customer and promises to buy it back the next day for a higher price.  Greater price 
reflects interest.  Banks used repos  to circumvent the law, so banks could pay businesses 
interest on their check ing accounts. Before the 1980s, U.S. banks could not pay interest on 
checking accounts. For example , IBM has excess funds i n their checking account.  Bank 
sells IBM T -bills and uses IBM’s funds . Next day , the bank returns IBM’s  funds  with 
interest  and t akes the T -bills back.  Consequently, the bank paid interest on a checking 
account, although the U.S. law prohibited banks to pa y interest on ch ecking accounts . 
 Federal Funds  are overnight loans between banks.  For example, a bank with  excess fund s 
deposited at the Federal Reserve  can lend these funds to another bank.  Market analysts and 
the Fed scrutinize the inte rest rate in this market because  monetary policy influences  
immediately  the federal funds interest rate . 
 Eurodollars  are U.S. d ollars that people deposit  in foreign c ommercial banks outside the 
United States  and in foreign branches of U.S. banks.  Eurodollars are an important source of 
funds in the international market.  Furthermore, t he euro  has become a popular currency for 
investors, who  have bank accounts denominated in euros that a re located outside the 
Eurozone. The Euro zone comprise s of the 17 countries within  the European Union that use  
the euro as its currency.  If people and investors have euro denominated accoun ts outside 
the Eurozone, then we still call it  Eurodollars.  
Capital m arket securities  have maturities longer than a year , and we list the common ones : 
 
 U.S. Treasury securities are loans to the U.S. government.  The U.S. government issues 
Treasury Notes or T-notes  from one  to 10 years, while  Treasury Bonds or T-bonds  have 
maturities greater than 10 years.  These Treasury securities have a stated interest r ate, and 
government usually pays interest every six  months.  
 State and local govern ments can issue bonds,  called municipal bonds. The U.S. federal 
government encourages  investors to buy these bonds  by exempt ing investors  from  U.S. 
income  taxes . Furthermore, municipal bonds fall under two categories: General -obligation 
bonds and revenue bonds. For general -obligation bonds , a state or local government 
guarantees the bonds payment with its taxing power. For instance, a city governm ent builds 
a new  firehouse . Then the city government guarantees payment of the bonds with its power 
to tax. For revenue bonds , local or state government secures the bonds’ payment by the 
revenues that the project generates . For example, a college builds a new dormitory, u sing Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
28 
 revenue bonds. When the students pay to live there, the university pays the  bondholders  
some of the revenue . 
 We include  stocks and bonds  that we had defined earlier  in this chapter.  
 Mortgage  is a loan on  a house or property and the loan duration  range s from  15 to 30 
years.  Usually, the p roperty becomes  the collateral.  For instance , if a homeowner loses his 
job and cannot repay the mortgage, then the bank takes  possession of  his house.  We call 
this process  foreclosure  as a bank  takes the property and ev icts the homeowners . A variety 
of savings institutions and banks  grant s mortgages , making mortgages the largest debt 
market . 
 Commercial bank l oans are bank s lending  to businesses.  These loans do not have well 
developed secondary markets . 
 Government agencies can issue securities. For example, Sallie Mae is a quasi -government 
agency and lends to college students. Then Sallie Mae pools the student loans into a fund 
and issues bonds, allowing investors to buy into the fund. Subsequently, the i nvestors 
indirectly earn the interest from the students’ monthly payments. Thus, Sallie Mae 
increases the liquidity of student loans.  
Sallie Mae may experience financial hardship. U.S. economy has been plagued with weak 
economic growth since the 2007 Grea t Recession, and many college graduates cannot find jobs  
and start to default on their student -loan payments. Many call this the College Bubble. As 
college tuition soars into the stratosphere, many college students accumulate large amounts of 
debt to pay f or their education, and some of these students have slim chances of finding good -
paying jobs after they graduate. Consequently, high school graduates may shun coll ege to avoid  
accumulating debt, sparking a financial crisis for the U.S. colleges and univers ities. Then the 
colleges and universities could contract similar ly to the U.S. housing market after 2007.  
The United States Banking System  
The United States banking syst em differs from other industrial ized countries. For instance, 
the United States has mor e banks per capita , and the banks possess  fewer  assets  because  the U.S. 
government imposed strict  regulations. Early in the United States history, the public and 
government feared big banks, so state and federal government s passed regulations that forced  
banks to be small er and encouraged a large nu mber of banks to form .  
The United States , furthermore,  has a dual banking system . A bank  choose s a charter from 
a state government or from the U.S. federal government. A  charter is a document that legally 
establ ishes a corporation and allows a financial institution to participa te in banking activities. A 
national  bank receives a charter from the federa l government, while a state bank  receives a 
charter from a state government.   Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
29 
 If a bank receives a charter from the federal government, then three government agencies 
can regulate that bank , which are: 
 
 Comptroller of the Currency , an office in the U.S. Treasury Department , regula tes national 
banks. This office also  grants charters on behalf of the U.S. federal government , and it  
requires national banks to be members of the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit 
Insurance  Corpo ration. As of 2010, the United States  had roughly 1,500 national banks and 
50 foreign national banks.  
 Federal D eposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  insures deposits at member banks. If this 
agency insures, then it also reg ulates. As of 2009, the FDIC had  8,195 member banks.  
 Federal Reserve System (Fed)  is the central bank of the United States  and the lender of 
the l ast resort . When a  bank encounters  financial difficulties a nd cannot receive a loan 
from other financial institution s, then  the bank can ask  the Fed  for a loan. Moreover, t he 
Fed regulates banks.  
A state -chartered bank could have  fewer regulations. A state  government agency regulates 
its state banks, and m any states require their  banks to join the Fed and/or FDIC . Therefore, a 
state bank could have one or more regulatory agencies to deal  with.  
U.S. government imposed a nothe r restriction  upon the U .S. banking industry – the 
McFadden Act. The McFadden Act  prohibited a commercial bank from opening a branch in 
another state. This law put national and state banks on equal footing and helped foster 
competition. How ever, this law kept  small inefficient banks  in business, causing the United 
States to have the largest number of banks in the world. The United States had 14,217 banks in 
1986, which fell to 9,459 banks by 2010.  
Some states imposed more restrictions upon their  banks  than other states . For example, 
some states  had imposed unit banking that restricted  a bank to one geographic location. Unit 
banking  restricts  a bank to  a single geographical location, such as in one city, and the bank 
cannot branch to other cities . Currently, no states enforce unit banki ng. Furthermore, branch 
banking  allows a bank to have two or more banking offices owned by a single banking 
corporation within a geographical area. Geographic area can be a city, county, or statewid e. 
Currently , 45 states allow statewide branch banking.  
Different institutions evolved in the United States that differ from commercial banks. T hey 
include savings institutions and credit unions , and they are not commercial banks. T hus, they 
have their own regulatory agencies. These institutions either have a c harter from the federal 
government or a state government. The Federal Home  Loan Bank System (FHLBS) is a U.S. 
government agency  similar to the Federal Reserve. T he FHLBS regulates nearly  8,000 savings 
institutions. Moreover, the FDIC insures deposits at sa vings institutions. Most credit unions 
have charters from  the National Credit Union Administration , which  issues charters on the 
federal government’s behalf . This agency also insures the deposits at credit unions whi le the 
FDIC does not . Kenneth R. Szulczyk

 Why did U.S. and state government pr opagate such a complex system? F inancial sector is 
an extremely important sector of the economy, and every country around the world regulates its 
financial markets. G overnment uses  six reasons to regulate a banking system  and its financi al 
markets , which include :  
Reason 1:  Government s want  the financial s ystem  to be stable . Banks contribute to  a 
nation’s money supply. A  wave of bank failures could trigger  a large contract ion in the money 
supply, shrinking the economy and triggering  a severe recession . Many economists believe the 
Grea t Depression would not be  severe  if a wave of bank failures had not swept  across the 
country.  
Reason 2:  Money supply and financial markets are intertwined . If the central bank uses the 
money supply  to influenc e the inflation, business cycle, or interest rates, the central bank also 
affects  the financial markets. Consequently, central banks ne ed government regulations to 
control  monetary policy  effectively  and help achieve  low inflation and low unemployment .  
Reason 3:  The U. S. government wants to promote efficiency in the financial 
intermediation process.  
Reason 4:  The U.S. government wants to provide low -cost financing for homebuyers . This 
desire led to  the U.S. Housing Bubble that occurred between 1997 and 2 007. 
Reason 5:  Financial markets depend on accurate information. Governments  ensure 
borrowers provide accurate information to  investors. In the United States, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC)  requires publicly traded companies (i.e. a company sells stock to 
the public) to disclose financial information based on acceptable accounting standards.  
Reason 6 : The U.S. government wants to protect consumers. Financial system, such as  a 
bank can be ver y compli cated. Many depositors do not understand the financial instruments , and 
therefo re, they are not able to gauge  the soundness of the institution or make rational decisions. 
In a compet itive market like TVs, DVDs,  computers , and cell phones , the consu mers can easily 
evaluate and compare different products.  
The Glass Steagall Banking Act  
Politic ians and the public thought  commercial banks should not underwrite new stock and 
bonds for corporations  because  they believed banks were underwriti ng “risky” sec urities. 
Furthermore,  the banks possess  enormous power to create monopolies. Thus, the United States 
government passed the Glass -Steagall Banking Act in 1933. This law divided the functions of 
investment banking and commercial banking. A commercial bank is  a standard bank while a n 
investment banker markets and sells brand new stocks and bonds. In practice, the Glass -Steagall 
Banking Act insulated investment banking from the competition. Consequently, borrowers 
could pay more for issuing new securities than they would  pay if commercial banks could 
underwrite new securities. The United States government repealed pieces of the Glass -Steagall 
Act in 1999 to allow U.S. investment b anks to compete internationally  as they moved into 
commercial banking and insurance.  
The Glass -Steagall Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) . The 
FDIC, a public corporation,  insures the deposits of each depositor in commercial banks up to 
$250,000. For exam ple, if you have $150,000 in your checking account and $150,000 in Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
31 
 certificates of deposits, the FDIC would insure  a total of $250,000. If your bank fai ls, you are 
guaranteed that you will get  at least $250,000 from FDIC, potentially losing $50,000. In som e 
cases, the FDIC insured all deposits that exceeded $250,000 per person , while it did not  for 
other bank failures . It depends how FDIC handles the bank failure.  
FDIC receives its funding from insurance premiums . Every  commercial bank  that is a 
member of F DIC must  pay approximately $100,000 per year. The FDIC became  very successful  
because  bank failures average d 10 per year  between 1934 and 1981 . On the other hand, bank 
failures averaged 2,000 per year during the Great Depression  before the U.S. government 
created the FDIC . 
The FDIC uses two methods to deal with  bank  failures. First,  the FDIC closes the bank and 
seizes the bank’s  assets. Then the FDIC sells  the bank’s assets and returns the money to the 
depositors. If FDIC does not receive enough money to pa y all depositors from selling the bank’s 
asset, subsequently, the FDIC pays th e difference from its own funds . Thus, th e FDIC rarely  
uses the first method  because  the FDIC could  pay out millions or billions in claims. Second , the 
FDIC purchases and assum es control of the failed bank. Next, t he FDIC k eeps the bank open 
and searches for  another bank that will  buy the failed bank. If the FDIC cannot f ind a buyer, 
then FDIC can grant  extra incentives, such as low -interest rate loans from the FDIC, or the 
FDIC b uys the problem loans from the fa iled bank’s portfolio. The FDIC also  allows a bank to 
cross a state line to buy a failed bank . Although federal law prohibited banks from crossing state 
lines and opening banks in another state, the federal government did  not hesitate to violate its 
own rules when it needed  to. 
The U.S. governme nt established the FDIC to reduce  the bank failure rate  by preventing 
bank runs. A bank run  is deposito rs discover  their bank has  financial trouble, so everyone runs 
to the bank to withdraw their deposits. Unfortunately, a bank holds only a fraction of the total 
deposits  because  a bank grants loans. Thus, a bank will close its doors after the bank has drained 
all the cash  from the vault. Fur thermore, if the bank granted  many illi quid loans, then the bank 
must  sell these loans at a discount in order to raise more reserves. Selling the illiquid loans at a 
discount can cause the bank to become insolvent. Insolvent  occurs as  a bank's total liabilities 
exceed  its total assets. Consequently , any bank  on the verge of failing  cannot return  money to  its 
deposi tors. Even a financially healthy  bank could fail if people spread rumor s the bank has 
financial  trouble s. Then the rumor triggers a bank run.  
Bank runs can lead to contagion. Contagion  is a bank run on one  bank leads to bank runs 
on other banks. For example, depositors line up at one bank to withdraw their accounts; 
subsequently, many depositors do not get their mone y back. Then the depositors  tell fr iends and 
family, and they begin  questio ning the health of their banks. M any people  cannot gauge the 
financial health of banks. Friends and family run  to their banks to withdraw funds from their 
accounts, triggering  more bank runs. As the contagion spreads, it  cause s a wave of severe bank 
runs called financial panics . Financial p anics  can push the economy into  a serious recession.  
The FDIC charges insurance premiums based on the total amount of deposits at the bank 
and the risk level the  depository institution s pose  to the FDIC. Many banks are experiencing 
financial difficulties  that resulted  from the 2008 Financial Crisis  because  the banks approved 
anyone for a mortgage. As the U.S. entered a recession in 2007, some homeowners started Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
32 
 defaulting on their mortgages. Un fortunately, the ho using values  were  falling since 2 007. If a 
bank foreclosed on a person’s house, then a bank possesses  a home that is losing value. Thus, 
the financial crisis caused 140 banks to f ail during 2009 , causing financial difficulties for the 
FDIC. Th en the  FDIC requires  banks to prepay their deposit insurance for 2010, 2011, and 
2012. The FDIC wants banks to prepay $45 b illion in deposit insurance after it already  doubled 
the insurance premium s for 2009.  
Financial Innovation  
Financial markets a nd institutions continually change and evolve , and financial innovation  
can drive this change . If a new financial instrument lowers risk, increases liquidity, or increases 
information, then investors are attracted to the new security. For example, mutual fu nds are one 
financial i nnovation. A mutual fund pools  money from many people  together  into a fund , and a  
fund manager invests the fund in a variety of stocks. Consequently, this method lowers 
investors’ risk through diversificati on of stocks. For example, you manage your mutual fund , 
and you bought 30 different corporate stock s. Your Coca -Cola stock rises one day  while  the 
value of your IBM stock declines. Overall, the average of the fund’s 30 stocks could earn a 
return for the fund investors.  If you bought  only Kodak corporate stock , then you w ould lose  
your investment when  Kodak filed  for bankruptcy.  
Regulations can spur  innovation. The U.S. and state governments have always heavily 
regulated their financial institutions. Consequently, these institutions i ngeniously circumvented 
these regulations by creating new financial instruments or new financial institutions. First 
method to circumvent banking regulations , bank leaders and owners developed  bank holding 
companies . A bank holding company is one corporati on obtains ownership or control of two or 
more independent banks. A bank holding company can do three things.  
 
 Bank holding company can branch within states or across state lines. For example, a 
corporation buys enough common stock of two banks to be come  the majority shareholder. 
Majority  shareholder  elect s the Board of Directors and vote s on corporate policy. 
Therefore, the holding company can control several banks  in several states, circumventing 
the McFadden Act .  
 Bank holding companies can buy other n on-bank companies and enter  other spheres of 
economic activity, such as data processing, investment advice, and insurance. Allowing 
banks to participate in nonfinancial activities is called universal banking .  
 Bank holding company can  raise non -deposit funds. For example, a bank holding company 
controls one bank, and this bank needs funds. Holding company issues commercial paper 
on itself and diverts these  funds to the bank, circumventing the  interest rate restric tions on 
bank deposits . 
Second in novation , nonbank bank , allows  banks to circumvent federal and state 
regulations.  Legal definition of a bank is an institution that accepts deposit s and makes loans. Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
33 
 What would happen if a bank stopped accepting deposits? Legally, the bank is  no longer a bank 
and becomes exempted from  the extensive U.S. bank regulations. Nonbank bank is simply a 
finance company.  
Third innovation was the creation of money -market mutual funds (MMMF) . MMMFs are 
pools of liquid money -market assets manag ed by investment compani es. The MMM F is 
identical to a mutual fund . Investment companies sell shares to the public in small 
denominations , and the fund managers  invest in money market instruments . Consequently , 
MMM F became  very successful. MMM F grew  from $3.3 billion  in 1997  into $186.9 billion in 
1981 and 959.8 billion by 2010.  
The MMMFs began hurting the banks  financially  as people started  withdraw ing money 
from the ir bank accounts and invest ing them  into MMMFs. MMMFs paid a higher interest rate , 
and they allow check -writing pri vileges. Accordingly, banks  began losing customers , and they 
place pressure the regulatory agencies that, in turn, placed  pressure on Congress and the 
President to change the laws. Since 1982, banks began  offering money market deposit accounts 
(MMDA ) that are similar to  a MMMF  with only one difference . The FDIC considers a MMDA 
to be a bank account and thus, it insures them , while  it does not insure MMMFs . Finally, 
MMDAs have no reserve requirements , and they have grown rapidly as people started to invest 
in them.  
Last innovation, automated teller machine (ATM ), allowed  banks to  circumvent 
regulations.  Modern computer technology allows a bank's customers to receive banking services 
through computer terminals located at banks, stores, and shopping malls. Cust omers can make 
deposits, withdrawals, and credit -card transactions. Technically, ATMs are not bank branches, 
and are not subjected to branch banking rest rictions. Therefore, ATMs are  located some dis tance 
away from the main bank. Furthermore, m any banks cr eated n etworks, so customers could  
access their accounts from any place within the United States  and across the world . Moreover, 
banks offer debit cards. For example, a customer uses a debit card to pay for goods and services 
by electronically transferring  funds from his checking account to a store's bank account. T hus, 
the debit card  has replaced  checks. Some businesses do not accept checks, but take debit cards  
because  the merchant s know  they will receive money from the  customer 's bank . 
Political climate was changing in the United States  before the 2008 Financial Crisis . 
Innovation, rising inte rest rates, and deregulation were eroding  the regulatory structure set up in  
the 1930s. Banks can  cross state lines, open branches in other states, offer investment advice and 
brokerage services. Th us, th e banking industry experienced  two trends. First, b anks can  acquire 
other banks, reducing  the number of banks in the United States . Second, as ban ks merge, they  
become bigger as  their asset s grow . U.S. banks were  approach ing the size of Japanese and 
German bank s, which traditionally were  larger in asset size.  
Then the 2008 Financial Crisis  struck the U.S. economy, causing  many commercial  and 
investmen t banks to teeter on bankruptcy. T he U.S. federal government came to the rescue and 
purchased stock of many financial corporations. Taxpayers indirectly helped  the corporations . 
Subsequently,  the U.S. government helped and approved many bank mergers, inclu ding mergers 
between co mmercial and investment banks. Consequently, t he U.S. government bail ed out these 
banks because they were too big to fail . A wave of large bank  failures would implode  the whole Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
34 
 U.S. financial system . Thus, th e U.S. banks will become larger  with partial government 
ownership (or interference depending on your viewpoint ).  
Many critics of financial deregulation demand the U.S. government to re-enact  the Glass –
Steagall  Act that  would  separate commercial and inv estment banking activities . Many  leaders  
around t he world are debating whether to pass new laws to separate  commercial and investment 
banking  in their countries  because the 2008 Financial Crisis  forced governments to spend 
billions in bailing out their large banks .

 3. Multinational Enterprises  
This chapter defines and distinguishes  the three business forms: proprietorships, 
partnerships, and corporations. Then  students study the  corporations  extensively  because they 
have many advantages  over proprietorships and partnerships , as well as differen t management 
structures.  Although corporations roughly comprise  20% of U.S. businesses, they dominate the 
busine ss and financial markets. Unfortunately, the corporate structure has  several disadvantages 
with the main one being susceptible  to corporate  fraud. Thus, students  study the  disadvantages  
and ways to minimize them . Finally, corpor ations  dominate internat ional trade and finance , 
which is why we study them  in this book . Towards the end of the chapter , we explain the Law of 
Comparative Advantage , and why businesses  engage  and profit from  free trade . 
Forms of Business Organizations  
Goal of a business is to earn prof its. Alfred P. Sloan stated , “General Motors is not in the 
business of making automobiles. General Motors is in the business of making mone y.” All 
business ow ners seek profit, and  we classify them  as a sole proprietorship, partnership, and 
corporations. Sole proprietorship  is one person owns the business. That one person becomes  
liable for all the business’s debts, and the business is dissolv ed legally , when the owner dies. 
Sole proprietors are the most numerous business es in th e United States, and they  usually own 
farms, grocery stores, hotels, and restaurants.  
A partnership  is a business owned and managed by two or  more people. Partnership i s 
defined as  general or limited liability . Under a gener al partnership, all partners become  liable for 
the partnership’s debts and obligations. If one partner applies for a bank loan, steals the money, 
and flees the country , the remaining partners become  liable for the bank loan. A limited liability 
partnership restri cts liability and helps protect the partners’ assets that he or she  does not use  
directly  in the business . Thus, a partner can only lose assets invested in the partnership while  his 
or her other assets are protected from  creditors. On the other hand, general partnership s do not 
have this protection. If a general partnership bankrupts, then creditors can go after a partner s’ 
assets  such as the partner s’ house, car, personal bank accounts, and other assets. Usual 
partnerships are a ccounting and law firms.  
A corporation  becomes the last form, and the focus of this chapter. Although corporations 
comprise approximately 20% of businesses in the United States,  they dominate domestic and 
international markets  because they enter into all spheres of business activity. Unfortunately, 
corporations can become so complex; the management loses  sight on its goal of earning profits. 
For instance, shareholders  represent  the owners of the corporation, and they should benefit. 
Sometimes  corporate managers  lose sight of earning profits . Unfortunately, the managers  do not 
maximize  the shareholders’ wealth, maximize share price, or maximize a firm’s value . 
However, if a corpora tion continually earns l osses year after year, then the business would fail, 
similar ly to a proprietorship and  partnership . Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
38 
 Corporations  
Corporations start as private companies that transform into a corporation. They have an 
Initial Public Offer (IPO) , the day the corporation begins selling stock to the public. Usually, 
the corporation’s founder holds large shares in the company’s stock  and becomes a millionair e 
or billionaire over night from  the market value of his or her  stock holdings.  
A charter  is a leg al document from government that creates the corporation. By law, the 
corporation becomes an independent lega l entity with rights similar to a  person. A state 
government approves corporate charters in the Uni ted States. For example, several corporations 
choose the  State of Delaware because  the state charges the lowest fees  to incorporate.  
A corporation has three parties: stockholders, board of directors, and executive officers. 
Stockholders own the corporation,  and they usually meet  once a year to vote fo r the board of 
directors, and  one share equals one vote. Consequently, the majority shareholder dominates the 
board of directors, and therefore, controls the corporation. Of course, a majority shareholder 
could be another corporation. Next, the board of di rectors sets corporate policy, declares 
dividends, and selects the president and execu tive officers. Executive officers operate the daily 
business of the corporation.  
We show two corporate forms  in Figure 1. For both forms, the stockholders are the owners 
and elect the board of directors. They differ  who becomes the  president of the corporation. In 
the first form,  the board chairman is also the chief executive officer and president of the 
corporation. For the second form, the board appoints a chief operatin g officer to be president of 
the corporation.  
 
 
Figure  1. Two forms of corporate management  
 
Corporations are large organizations that can raise a substantial amount of financial capital. 
Consequently, a corporation has financial resources to enter forei gn countries and dominate 
international trade. Furthermore, it creates special departments that employ specialists in law, 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
39 
 taxes, finance, and accounting, who hand le operations for foreign countries. Advantages of the 
corporate form include : 
 
 A corporation  has limited liability. Stockholders own the corporation, and they are not 
liable for a corporation's debt. If a corporation fails,  subsequently, the  stockholders only 
lose their investment , the amount of common stock that they had purchased.  
 Stockholders can easily transfer corporate ownership. Stocks  are certificates that represent 
ownership in a corporation, and stockholders can freely buy or sell stock to other investors  
through the stock market .  
 Corporations have continuity of life. Theoretically, a c orporation could live forever.  
 Stockholders do not have a mutual agency relationship , where  the stockholders cannot 
bind a corporation to contracts.  Stockholders have no say in the daily operation of the 
corporation  even though they own the corporation . 
Corporations have two disadvantages. First, government heavily regulates corporations. 
Corporations file many reports with government  because corporations can expand into many 
countries, markets, and industries . Corporations  may encourage regulations becau se 
bureaucratic red tape create s barriers to  entry. Thus, new companies experience trouble s 
entering the market with complex and arduous regulations. Second, government imposes taxes 
twice on corporations. Corporations pay taxes from their profits. Then st ockholders receive 
profit from the corporation as dividends , and the dividends become  income to the stockholder 
that a government also taxes.  
Corporations could issue two different classes of stock: common stock and preferred stock. 
Common stock  allows sto ckholders to vote a t stockholder meetings, while preferred stock  does 
not have any voting rights. For stockholders to give up their voting  right, they will receive their 
dividends before the common stockholders. Consequently, a corp oration c ould issue pref erred 
stock t o expand operations  and not share control  of the corporation  with the new preferred 
stockholders. Moreover, corporations can pay different dividends, paying a higher dividend to 
the common s hareholders.  
We define preferred stock  by the followi ng categories : 
  
 Cumulative Preferred Stock  – a corporation must pay past -due dividends to cumulative 
preferred stoc kholders before it pays dividends  to common stockholders.  Stockholders only 
receive dividends, when the board  of directors declares them .  
 Protected Preferred Stock  – a corporation must deposit part of its profits into a fund , and, 
thus, the corporation can guarantee dividend payments to  preferred stockholders.  
 Redeemable Stock  – a corporation has the right to repurchase the preferred stock in the 
future.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
40 
  Convertible Stock  – a stockholder can convert preferred stock into common stock on a 
specific date in the future.  
Issuing of stock allows corporations to garner large amounts of financial capital. 
Furthermore, a corporation can raise capital  by issuing  bonds. A bond is a loan. Howeve r, a 
bond is standardized,  allow ing investors to buy or sell bonds on the financial markets. 
Moreover, a  bond holder  has two rights. First, a corporation pays interest on the bond, regardless 
of a corporation’s fin ancial position. Second, a corporation pays the face value of the bond on a 
specific date in the future. If a corporation bankrupts or it is dissolved, subsequently, the 
corporate debts are paid first that include bonds, bank loans, and taxes. If any asset s remain, 
then the preferred stock holders are paid, and finally, the common stockholders are last.  
Corporations can buy other corporations. For instance, a parent corporation can have many 
subsidiaries, and the parent company does not fully integrate the subsidiaries into the parent 
corporation. Corporations develop these complex structures  because  of lawsuits, taxes, and 
regulations. Unfortunately, lawsuits are common and excessive in the U.S. If a successful 
lawsuit bankrupts a subsidiary, only that subs idiary is impacted. For example, a judge sued a dry 
cleaner for $65 million  because  the dry cleaner lost his pants. Although the dry cleaner found 
the judge’s pants a week later, the lawsu it bankrupted the dry cleaner. In another example,  a 
corporation own s 10 different apartment  complexes. A corporation establishes each apartment 
complex as a separate, legal entit y. If a tenant is injured on one  property, he o r she can sue the 
complex that  limits the  lawsuit to one subsidiary.  
Stockholders, of course, want  a good return for their investment. A return  reflects  an 
investor’s profit stated in annual percentage terms, and it has two sources: Dividend yield and 
capital gains. A dividend yield  converts the dividend  into a percentage. For example, you 
received $1 per share on your Facebook stock with a value of  $20 per share. Dividend equals  D; 
the stock price is P, and t ind icates today’s time . We calculate your dividend yield as 5%  in 
Equation 1.  
 
%520$1$100 100 
tt
PD= yield dividend       (1) 
 
Investors could earn a capital gain , which means they can sell their stock for a greater price 
than the amount they paid for it. For example, you bought your Facebook stock for $18 per 
share last year and sold it this year for $20. We compu te a capital gain of  11.1%  in Equation 2. 
Notice the  subscripts; t represents today  while t -1 represents  last year. If the investment does not 
exactly equal one year, then we must  adjust the capital gain. For instance, if your investment 
lasted for two yea rs, subsequently, you would divide the capital gain by 2, converting it into an 
annual return.

PPP= gain capital      (2) Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
41 
  
Your return from your Facebook investment is the dividend yield plus the capital gain , or 
16.1%. Corporate managers can influence t he dividend yield that  ranges approximately 2% per 
year while they have little influ ence on the capital gains that  could range as high as 12% per 
year. Unfortunately, investors could face catastrophic losses if a stock market quickly plummets 
during a downturn in an economy. For example, the U.S. stock markets dropped half in value 
during 2008, and many internet stocks became worthless during 2000 as the stock from internet 
companies plummeted. Consequently, investors could earn capital losses if  they sell their stock 
as it falls in value, or the corporation bankrupts.  
Corporations can use subsidiaries to avoid regulations or avoid taxes. For i nstance, a parent 
corporation could  relocate to the  Bahamas or Cayman Islands. These c ountries are tax ha vens 
with low taxes, little regulations, and strong confidentiality laws. Consequently, corporations 
can shift assets and liabilities among subsidiaries to decrease their overall t ax burden. At this 
point, we  clarify some tax terminology. Tax evasion  is a person or corporation owes a 
government for taxes, but refuses to pay it. Some activity c reated the tax liability, and the law 
requires them to pay taxes. Otherwise, g overnment can assess fines or send the tax evaders to 
prison. However, corporations can u se tax avoidance  because they can afford to hire specialists . 
Tax avoidance  is the managers careful plan the corporate activities and prevent  the creation of 
tax liabilities.  
Dividing line between tax evasion and avoidance can be a thin one. Since the 200 7 Great 
Recession is still imp acting the world economy in 2013 , some t ax authorities penalize and fine  
companies that use tax avoidance. Unfortunately, tax collections are down, and many 
governments are becoming aggressive in tax collections.  For example, Italian tax inspectors 
board yachts as they dock in Italian ports. Italian yacht owners registered their yachts in the 
Cayman Islands, avoiding registration fees and avoiding the VAT fuel taxes. Consequently, the 
Italian ports reported 40% declines in yach t docking as the yacht owners avoid Italy’s ports. 
Unfortunately, the economies around the ports suffer from fewer customers, who shop and eat in 
the local communities, which could further depress tax revenues.  
Corporate Fraud  
The Enron Corporation declare d bankruptcy in 2001  and became t he universal symbol for 
corporate f raud. Enron  managers  created Special Purpose Entities (SPE)  with the sole purpose to 
wipe debt and liabilities from Enron’s financial statements. A Special Purpose Entity  consists 
of a com pany or sub sidiary  of the corporation. A  SPE could be a shell company, where the 
company does not physically exist, except on paper.  
The Enron managers invested in many power plants around the world, and some of its 
investments soured and failed. Then, they created off -balance sheet companies, and they sold its 
bad investments to its SPEs. Afterwa rds, their balance sheet appeared  financial ly strong, and 
Enron applied for more ba nk loans, gaining more  cash. Next, the Enron management bought 
more companies , and they repeated the process. At the end, Enron hid $25 billion in debt from 
its investors.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
42 
 Enron’s managers  invested Enron stock in the SPEs. As Enron’s stock price soared, the 
SPE's finances remained healthy until Enron’s stock price peaked at $90 per share. Once 
Enron’s stock price began plummeting until it fell  below  one dollar per share in 2000, the SPEs 
earned substantial loss es. Enron hid  the losses  and a sked banks for more  loans that would keep 
the company afloat, but Enron failed to obtain new loans. The U.S. economy entered a recession 
in 2001 after many internet companies bankrupted in 2000. A recessio n always exposes an 
organization’s weakness. Unfortunately, Enron employees’ pension fun ds we re invested in 
Enron stock, and  many employees lost their pension funds and became unemployed.  
Almost everyone in the financial world overlooked the SPEs, includin g Enron’s auditor, 
Arthur Anderson, Enron’s law firm, and the regulators from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC). Then the U.S. government passed the Sarbanes -Oxley Act in 2002, which 
required CFOs and CEOs to sign their company’s financial state ments. Law’s goal was to 
increase transparency. Transparency  means outsiders can look at an organization, and know the 
rules and can accurately assess a firm's true finances. Unfortunately, Enron was “a black box,” 
and only a few insiders knew Enron’s  genu ine financial picture. On the other hand,  a non-
transparent govern ment  tends to be corrupt. For example, if government officials do not write 
down the laws and rules , or the laws and rules are vague , subsequently, the bureaucrats have 
wide discretion  wheth er to approve a business license or activity, fueling corruption.  
The U.S. economy rebounded from the strong, overly optimistic real estate market. 
Everyone forgot Enron’s misdeeds until the 2007 Great Recession, when the scale of fraud 
became much larger.  For example, Lehman Brothers used exotic securities such as credit default 
swaps and collateralized debt obligations to buy real estate (Discussed in Cha pter 18). After  the 
recession had struck , unemployment doubled , and many households started  defaulting  on their 
mortgages. Commercial and investment banks stopped lending overnight, and real estate prices 
began tumbling . Unfortunately, Lehman Brothers went on a spending spree, buying real estate 
toward the peak of t he housing bubble. It held  $768 billion  in bank and bond debt while it  had 
$639 billion  in assets that dropped  rapidly  as real estate prices fell. Lehman Brothe rs filed for 
bankruptcy in 2008 and had closed  its doors after 158 years of business.  
Countries differ in corporate structure and plannin g. The U.S. corporations usually  focus on 
short -term profits, and thus, they have problems with corporate fraud. On the other hand, the 
Japanese plan long term and they form a Keiretsu , a conglomerate of many companies with a 
bank member. Consequently, the  bank could grant low -interest loans to its partner companies, 
and the Keiretsu usually focuses on long -term profits and market shares. Furthermore, 
corporations in South Korea, Germany, and Russia also established conglomerates, which are 
similar to a Kei retsu.  
Some government s become  a shareholder in a com pany, which the former communistic 
countries  often use. Government retain s control over the company, and it  attract s partners who 
bring technology and efficient management practices. Unfortunately,  gove rnment as a 
shareholder becomes susceptible to corr uption because a government can  use its authority to 
protect the  company and isolate it from  competition.  
Some corporations  suffer from the principal -agent problem , when  two related parties have 
different incentives, creating conflicts and odds with each other. For example, the corporate Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
43 
 structure separates the managers from the owners (i.e. stockholders). Stockholders select 
managers, who maximize profits, maximize  the return to the shareholders  and/or inc rease 
shareholder value. However, managers may not act in the best interest to the owners. They want 
high salaries, generous benefits, luxurious offices, and access to priva te planes and Limousines, 
reducing  the return to the stockholders.  
The U.S. investm ent banks, for example, were partnerships before the 1 990s, and the 
managers handled money  careful ly. They were both the principal and agent. Then the managers 
converted the investment banks to corporations during the 1990s, and the managers gambled 
and to ok high risks  while the shareholders owned the corporations . Investment banks became 
involved in the mortgage market in the early 2000s and were caught in the mania of the U.S. 
housing bubble. When the bubble deflated, the shareholders lost their stock val ue during the 
2008 Financial Crisis. Finally,  for one perverse example,  GM cancelled its stock, and the 
shareholders lost everything during 2008. Remember, the corporate managers represent the 
shareholders and run the corporation on their behalf.  
A family who dominates a corporation could reduce the principal -agent problem. For 
example, the Walton fam ily is the majority shareholder s who actively manage the Wal -Mart  
Corporation. Microsoft was  similar, when Bill Gates was both the CEO and majority 
shareholder . Consequently, they become  both the agent and pri ncipal, and they have one united 
interest - to earn profit s. Thus, these companies  earned high return s, and  managers have  better 
vision and oversight  over their corporations . 
Expanding into Foreign Countries  
A multinational corporation  is a company incorporates itself  in one country and operates 
in one or more  foreign  countries.  For example, British Petroleum, General Electric, Toshiba, and 
Wal-Mart are multinational corporations with extensive busin ess activities that span across the 
globe. Sometimes financial analysts use the term, multinational enterprise  because  a 
government could form  a joint venture with a corporation , and the  definition of an enterprise 
implies  a broader meaning . 
A multinationa l enterprise’s goal is to earn profits. Therefore, they enter the international  
markets and foreign countries in the pursuit of pro fits. Every international enterprise ha s a 
choice. It could  export to  another country or relocate  production outside their ho me country . For 
instance, many U.S. corporations  relocated manufacturing outside the United States, although 
the U.S. suffers from a high unemployment rate since the  beginning of the  Great Recession.  
Financial analysts and economists divide the world’s ma rkets into mature economies and 
emerging markets. Mature economies  are competitive, and a company entering this market 
would face narrow profit margins. Some examples include the United States and Europe. On the 
other hand, the emerging -market economies  are countries that recently opened their markets to 
international trade and finance. They can be very profitable but entail greater risk. For example, 
China, India, and Mexico are removing their government controls of their markets, and they 
allow interna tional investors and corporations to invest in their economies.  
A government  that attracts foreign investment  must change its laws to reflect three 
requirements. First, a government establishes an open -market place  that means  a government Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
44 
 allows free mark ets and allows the free movement of capital, lab or, and technology. Thus , a 
government relaxes its control over its market. Second, a government allows strategic 
management . Thus, c ompanies can develop new products and services, and compete with other 
comp anies . Furthermore, a  multinational enterprise could tailor  its goods and serv ices to 
accommodate different cultures  and tastes . Finally, multinational corporations need access to 
capital  because  international activities require financing. Hence, a country  must allow the free 
movement of money, and corporations are free to  issue more stock, bonds, or receive bank loans  
without government interference . Consequently, a firm has twelve reasons to relocate 
production to another country, rather than to export.  
Reason 1: A foreign g overnment offers subsidies and tax breaks  to a company. Some 
countries such as Dubai (United Ara b Emirates) and China have free -trade zones, where 
companies pay little or no taxes, experience few regulation s, and  can freely export their  products 
and services  to the international markets . Consequently, some governments offer incentives to 
companies because they want to create jobs  and reduce  unemployment and poverty rates.  
Reason 2 : A company g ains access to technology from another countr y. For example, India 
has talented computer programmers and engineers, who work for relatively lower wages than 
their counterparts in the United States and Europe. Consequently, a company could relocate  to 
India to tap into their skilled workforce . 
Reason 3: An enterprise  that moves its factories to a foreign country automatically avoids  
trade restrictions, like tariffs and import quotas . Government does not apply trade restrictions  to 
products and services produced within a country.  
Reason 4 : A company rel ocates its manufacturing facilities to r educe transportation costs . 
For example, sugarcane is bulky and expensive to transport. Conse quently, sugar producers 
locate  the sugar mills cl ose to the sugarcane fields. Then they extract and purify the sugar and  
ship it to distant markets.  
Reason 5 : A business g ains access to new markets and more consumers . For instance, the 
Coca -Cola Corporation produces  and sells  its carbonated soda products in most coun tries around 
the world, boosting its  consumers.   
Reason 6 : A company could  diversify its business and manufacturing by expanding into 
foreign markets. S ome foreign markets grow  quickly , while other m arkets experience  weak 
growth. Consequently, the business could  earn a return on its investments.  
Reason 7 : A company  needs an  important raw material  for production . For example, 
battery manufacturers need lithium to produce laptop batteries. They  started  mining and refining 
facilities in Bolivia  because  Bolivia possesses half the world’s reserves for lithium.  
Reason 8 : Businesses and companies reduce their production costs . Consequently, many 
U.S. manufacturing companies moved to China and Mexico  to take advantage of the lower 
wages and comparable productivity .  
Reason 9 : A company outsources  its production to another co mpany , usually located 
outside the country. For example, Microsoft outsourced its production of X -box consoles to 
Flextronics, a Singaporean company. Then Flextronics outsourced the production to a Chinese 
manufacturing plant. Consequently, outsourcing can  lowe r a company’s cost, granting  it a cost  
advantage over its competitors.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
45 
 Reason 1 0: A company investing in a foreign market today may lead to future investments. 
For example, a company opens a su bsidiary in Moscow, Russia. After establishing  the 
subsidi ary, the company can  open branches i n other Russian cities  or enter  other Russian 
speaking countries.  
Reason 1 1: A company that p roduces in a foreign market reduce s economic exposure. 
Economic exposure  is changes in economic factors , such as inflation, interest rates , and 
exchange rates  affect a company's profits. One imp ortant factor is fluctuating  exchange rates. A 
company could experience wide swings in profits  if it produces in one country and exports to 
another. However, if the company produces and sells within the same country, fluctuating  
exchange rates would  impact  less because  the company ’s revenues and costs are denominated in 
the same currency. Thus, a company's profit could remain stable in a foreign market.  
Reason 1 2: Many companies relocate  subsidiaries to p olitical ly safe and business -friendly 
countries, such as the B ahamas, Dubai, and Singapore . These countries have low taxes and few 
regulations.  
Multinational enterprises are more complicated  than businesses that remain in their home 
count ry. First, the b usinesses transfer resources, such as  machines, equipment, and labor 
between  different countries. Next, they ship products and services to  other  countries . 
Consequently, companies need excellent management in logistics, and  specialists who monitors 
a country’s different laws and regulations. Second, international e nterprises are exposed to 
exchange rate risks and credit risks . Thus, a company’s profit can quickly change due to 
fluctuations in currency exc hange rates , or a company cannot get  credit to finance operations in 
a specific country . Finally, e nterpris es have other exposures, such as  country risk . For example, 
when Hugo Chavez became president of Venezuela, his government began nationalizing 
companies. Any international enterprise in Venezuela can experience  the seizure of its assets 
without compensation.  
A country risk  is the risk of in vesting in a particular country  as political conditions rapidly 
change. For example, the Republic of Kazakhstan was a  former state of the Soviet Union that 
became an independent country in 1991. Country’s president, Nursultan  Nazarbayev , open ed its 
economy  to free markets in early 1990s . Consequently, K azakhstan made great strides towards a 
market economy and attracted billions in international investment  because  the country contains 
vast petroleum and mineral wealth. After the 2008  Financial Crisis , the Kazakh government  is 
gradually reviving the  Soviet rules,  practices , and regulations. Unfortunately, t he Soviet legal 
system is  very bureaucratic, slow, and arbitrary, and suffers from  corruption and political 
favoritism. Moreover, the Kazakh government nationalized several foreign -owned companies, 
and international investment began plummeting  in 2012.  
The Law of Comparative Advan tage 
Law of Comparative Advantage  forms the basis of free trade. David Ricardo, a British 
political economist, formulated the law in the 19 century. It states two countries can benefit 
from trade by specializing in the production of goods where a country  has a relatively cheaper 
cost. Thus, g overnments that instituted free trade between themselves help fuel the rapid growth 
of globalization and the rise of the multinational enterprise s. Political leaders reduced their Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
46 
 tariffs and trade barriers to allow mon ey, products, and services to cross borders. Finally, t he 
Law of Comparative Advantage still work s for a large country that can  produce everything.  
Economists use a  production possibilities curve (PPC)  to show how two countries benefit 
from free trade. A PPC represents graphically a country’s maximum production level for two 
goods given its endowment of resources. Resources include  labor, machines, equipment, land, 
and entrepreneurs. The PPC has three a ssumptions:  
 
 Both countries produce  at full employment , which means a country produces on the 
boundary of the production possibilities c urve. Thus, society employs  its entire labor force,  
and entrepreneurs use  all their  machines, equipment, and land to pro duce goods and 
services.  
 The PPCs are straight line s. Consequently, an industry experiences no losses when 
entrepreneurs move resources  from industry to another. Although this analysis  works with 
curved PPCs , the straight -line PPCs simplify the analysis . 
 Two countries,  the United States  and Mexico , produce only  tomatoes and cars .  
We begin the analysis with n o trade between Mexico and the Unite d States. United States 
produces 50 units  while  Mexico produces 60  if they shift the entire country’s resources to  
produce tomatoes . If entrepreneurs shift all the resources into car manufacturing, then the United 
States produces 100 cars  while  Mexico produces 30.  The i ntercepts indicate the maximum 
production levels for the PPC curves, which  we show  in Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2. The Production Possibi lities C urves for Mexico and the United States  
 
We set e ach c ountry’s production level  at the half -way point. Thus, the United States 
produces 25 tomatoes and 50 cars  while  Mexico produces 30 tomatoes and 15 cars. 
Conseque ntly, the total production  for both countries  equals  55 tomatoes and 65 cars.  
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
47 
 If Mexico and the Unite d States engage in free trade, sub sequently, the  countries specialize  
in producing  products where  they have low opportunity costs . Opportunity cost reflects  the 
slopes of the PPCs. Slope for the United States equals  0.5, which means the U.S. must  give up 
the production of on e car to produce  0.5 tomatoes . On the other hand, Mexico has a slope of 2. It 
can produce two tomatoes by giving up one car. Consequently,  the United States specializes in 
car manufacturing  while  Mexico specializes in growing tomatoes.  
Straight -line PPCs lead to complete specialization , whereas  curved PPCs have partial 
specialization because  curved PPCs experien ce increasing opportunity cost s as an industry 
expands. With complete specialization, t he United States produces all cars  while  Mexico 
produces all tomatoes  because  the opportunity costs do not change. U.S. entrepreneurs 
continually shift resources from the tomato industry into the car  industry until they reach the 
maximum car production. On the other hand, the Mexico entrepreneurs do the exact  opposite. 
Consequently, the United States produces 100 cars and grows zero tomatoes  while  Mexico 
grows 60 tomatoes and produces zero cars. Gain in world production  equals  35 cars and 5 
tomatoes . Unfortunately, we need more trade theory to predict  how the  countries would divide 
this extra production  between  themselves .  
This simple analysis of free trade has l imitations . First, this analysis do es not include the 
role of technology, or the flow of resources from one country to another. Second, this analysis 
does not include outsourcing. Outsourcing is a firm contracts part of its production to another 
firm in another country, and it has become ve ry popular. Finally, the c ommunication and 
transportation costs are decreasing , which strengthens outsourcing and the flow of resources.

 4. International Banks  
Globalization  influences the financial markets. In the last 40 years, savers and borrowers 
have become linked through the international financial markets. For example, a Japanese bank 
transfers funds from savers in Japan to lend to a company that builds a new factory in China. 
Thus, f unds move between countries, and investors have access to financial markets that scale 
across the world.  
Globalization has impacted the financial markets as products, services, and money  flow 
across a country’s borders . Moreover, globalization increased ra pidly since World War II and 
has three causes. First, many government leaders repealed laws that restricted the free flow of 
investment between countries. Second, countries are growing  economically. Thus, the savers 
can channel their funds into the interna tional financial markets, pursuing greater returns abroad.  
Finally, international c orporations produce products in one country and ship them to another. 
Furthermore, corporations need financing to engage in business in foreign countries; thus, they 
work wi th internation al banks. An international bank  operates in two or more countries. 
Corporations move products, services, and resources across international borders while the 
banks move the money. Af ter this chapter, students will understan d why banks enter t he 
international markets, and the methods a bank uses to enter a foreign market. Moreover, banks 
can circumvent government regulations as they cross borders , and they invented new financial 
instruments. Unfortunately, international banks pose many problems  for government regulators.  
Functions of International Banks  
International banks  transcend the functions of a domestic bank  because  they link savers 
and borrowers across  different countries . Consequently, an international bank  helps people and 
businesses e ngage in international trade  and finance. Furthermore, an international bank helps 
with foreign -currency exchange rates  and holds inventories of foreign currencies . For example, 
HP Corporation enters into a contract with a firm in Hong Kong to buy memory c hips.  HP goes 
to an international bank,  where the bank grants  a short -term loan for the memory chip purchase.  
Bank helps HP  pay for the memor y chips and can  help HP  with the currency exchange rates.  
International banks provide  three  benefits.  First, international banks accept deposits from 
savers and lend to borrowers , and t he savers and borrowers are  located in different countries . 
Second, international banks  lower transaction costs by reduc ing information costs, lowering the 
risk of investments, and  increasing the liquidity of financial markets.  Liquidity is the ease of 
converting assets to currency.  Currencies and bank accounts are the most liquid, while houses 
and cars are the least liquid assets. Finally , international banks stimulate financial in novation by 
creating new financial instruments.   
International banks link savers and borrowers  from different countries across  the world, 
crossing international borders.  International banks are  concentrated in financial centers across  
the world, such as Ne w York City, Tokyo, and London , and they  operate 24 hours every day , 
seven days a week . Consequently, a government in one country has problem s regulating its Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
50 
 bank’s activities  in other countries.  For example, Citibank has branches and subsidiaries in 
many countries around the world.  The U.S. government and Federal Reserve System have 
trouble regulating and monitoring all the bank’s activities.   
International banks are also located in  offshore markets . An offshore market has little 
regulations, low tax rates , and strict banker -customer confidentiality laws.  Leading offshore 
markets include  the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Dubai, Hong Kong, and Singapore.  If the 
regulatory agency believes a bank is participating in risky investments, the regulato ry agency 
has diff iculty  examining  bank records for subsidiaries located in offshore markets.  
Consequently, some wealthy  people , businessmen, and criminals hide their money in offshore 
accounts to evade taxes, to protect their wealth from countries with agg ressive tax policies, or to 
hide their profits from illegal business activities.  
Becoming an International Bank  
Banks in the United States use  four methods to become an international bank , which  are: 
Method 1:  The U.S. bank opens a bank branch  in a foreig n country.  These branches accept 
deposits and make loans.  U.S. banks  open branches in fin ancial centers around the world  or 
places  where U.S. firms and corporations engage in business.  Bank branches help the bank 
transfer money  across nations’ borders .  
Method 2:  The U.S. bank becomes a holding company . The U.S. bank buys and becomes a 
majority shareholder of a foreign bank.  The Federal Reserve  System restricts U.S. banks to 
invest  in foreign firms  that are “closely related to banking.”   
Method 3:  The U.S. bank becomes an Edge Act C orporation . The U.S. bank establishes  a 
subsidiary.  Subsidiary can accept deposits from both U.S. residents and  foreigners  but can only 
grant  loans for international business activity.  These international banks assist with international 
trade and foreign -currency exchange.  Furthermore, t he Federal Reserve System exempts the 
subsidiary  from some U.S. banking regulations and has the authority to  approve the Edge Act 
Corporation .  
Method 4: The U.S. bank creates an internationa l banking facility  (IBF) . An international 
banking facility,  similar to an Edge Act corporation , accept s deposits from foreigners and make s 
loans to foreigners.  The IBFs cannot conduct a ny business within the United States except with 
its parent company or  with other IBFs.  Government exempts IBFs  from many regulations , and 
they do not  pay local and state taxes.  The Fed encourages  U.S. banks to use an IBF  to engage  in 
the international markets.  
Foreign banks can enter the banking market in the United States , using  three methods.  
Method 1:  Foreign bank opens an agency office . Agency office cannot accept deposits 
from U.S. residents, but it can lend  to them.  Moreover, the agency office is not subjected to U.S. 
banking laws and does not  carry FDIC deposit insurance.  Agency office receives it s funding 
from foreign depositors and investors.  Agency office is  similar to a nonbank bank , and it  
circumvents the numerous U.S. banking regulations  because  the legal definition of a bank is an 
institution that accepts deposits and grants loans.  If the institution stops granting loans or stops 
accepting deposits, the n legally the institution is no longer  a bank.   Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
51 
 Method 2 : A foreign bank does business in the U.S. through a foreign bank branch . This 
is a full fledge bank that accepts deposits and makes loans.  Consequently, t he fo reign bank 
branch must follow  the U.S. banking regulations.   
Method 3 : A foreign bank enters the U.S. market through a subsidiary U.S. bank . Foreign 
bank buys  U.S. bank  stock, b ecoming  the majority shareholder.  Thus, th e foreign bank controls 
the U.S. bank , converting it into a subsidiary.  Many foreign banks  use subsidiaries t o enter the 
U.S. banking market  because the U.S. has a n extremely  complex legal system.  Hence , the U.S. 
bank employs staffs and experts who know  the laws, rules, and regulations.  If a foreign bank 
opened a new branch, the managers and staff  would spend time lea rning and complying with all 
numerous  rules and regulations.  
Exchange Rate Risk  
An excha nge rate  equals the  ratio of one currency to another currency.  We usually write an 
exchange rate  as Equation 1. For example,  one U.S. dollar equals  1.5 e uros.   
 
$1 = 1.5 euros           (1) 
 
For instance, y ou plan  a trip to the United States, and want to convert 1,500 euros  into U.S. 
dollars. How  many U.S. dollars would you have ? We use a t rick with exchange rates – retain the 
currency units in the calcul ation. If you computed  correct ly, then only one currency unit  would 
remain  after the calculation. We can form two ratios with the currency by dividing both sides of 
the equation by one of the currency units. We show the t wo ratios in Equation 2:  
 
11.51=euros$   or   11.51$euros=        (2) 
 
Now multiply the ratios by 1,500 e uros.  We see the f irst ratio is correct in Equation 3 
because  one currency unit remains after the calculation.  Ratio for Equation 4 is wrong  because  
the e uro currency units become  squared.  
 
1,0001.511,500 $=euros$euros         (3) 
 

12.25
11.51,5002
$euros=$euroseuros        (4) 
 
Exchange rates can fluctuate over time.  If the exchange rate had changed to  Equation 5, 
subsequently, the U.S. dollar buys more euros. Thus, the U.S. dollar appreciated. If the U.S. 
dollar appreciated, then the euro automatically depreciated. Consequently, appreciation  means  a 
currency becomes worth more in terms of another curre ncy, while depreciation  implies  the Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
52 
 other currency  falls in value . Consequently, appreciation and depreciation are relative concepts 
applied to one exchange rate. Trick is to examine  the currency that has  one unit. When you 
know what happens to that curren cy, then you  automatically know what has happened  to the 
other currency.  
 
$1 = 2 euros           (5) 
 
Exchange rate can also move  in the other direction.  If the exch ange rate changes to 
Equation 6, subsequently,  the U.S. dollar buys fewer e uros.  Thus, the U .S. dollar depreciated  
while  the e uro appreciated.   
 
$1 = 1 euro           (6) 
 
Financial analysts use the terms strong and weak to refer to a currency, which  differs  from  
appreciation and depreciation.  For instance, a weak U.S. dollar implies we compare the dollar  to 
a “basket” of currencie s. Overall, the dollar fell in value relative to the currencies in the  basket. 
Basket of currencies include s other industrialized countries, such as  Britain, Canada, Eurozone , 
and Japan.  
Fluctua ting exchange rates leads to the exchange rate risk , which can financially harm 
international banks , investors, and businessmen. Th us, th ey must  analyze and examine  the 
trends in exchange rates, when accepting deposits and grant ing loans. For example, an 
international bank accepts $1 million from depositors in the United State s, and the bank lends to  
a business in Russia for  $1 million. Many countries enforce  laws, where business act ivity must 
be denominated in that country’s cur rency. Hence , the bank converts the U.S. dollars into 
Russian rubles  because  businesses use the ruble  in Russia. If the exchange rate equals  $1 for 25 
rubles, we compute  the bank’s loan  at 25 m illion rubles  in Equation 7.  
 
rubles million =$rubles, $= Loan Bank 25125000 1,000     (7) 
 
What would happ en if the exchange rate varies ? Then the international bank could gain or 
lose from the exchange rate movement . If the currency exchange rate changes to $1 for 50 
rubles, subsequently, the U.S. dollar appreciated  while  the Russian ruble depr eciated.  When the 
Russian business repays  its 25 billion -ruble loan, we calculate  the bank receives $0.5 million  in 
Equation 8. Therefore, the bank experienced a major loss.   
 
00050050100000025 , $=rubles$rubles ,, = Loan Bank      (8) 
 
If the exchange rate changes to $1 equal  10 ruble s, then the Russian ruble appreciated while 
the U.S. depreciated.  We compute the  Russia n business repays a total of  $2.5 million dollars  in 
Equation 9. Consequently,  the international bank benefits  in this case . Money, Banking, and International Finance

International  Financial Securities  
International banks created several financial securities to hedge against foreign  exchange 
rate risk. Moreover , some financial securities allow international banks to ci rcumvent 
government regulations  and to facilitate international t rade.   
A bank, business, or investor can use a derivative as t he first line of defense again st the 
exchange rate risk . A derivative  is a contract for a future exchange of a c ommodity for money at 
a known  price  on a particular  date. Common commodities incl ude foreign currencies, petroleum,  
coffee, corn, wheat , Eurodollars, stocks, and  bonds . For example, a buyer and seller agree to  a 
future price  of coffee  today . The day the contract expires ; the buyer must buy the coffee for the 
price and quantity specifie d in the contract.  Derivative contract protects a bank, company , or 
investor  from price fluctuations , and they can buy and sell the contracts on the secondary 
markets before the contract matures. For the exchange rate risk, the investors can buy 
derivative s contracts where they buy a quantity of foreign currencies on a future date with a 
fixed exchange rate. On the other hand, the b uyer and seller exchange a commodity for money 
immediately  in the spot market, and  the spot market provides no protection against future price 
fluctuations.   
A derivative c ontract has many different forms . First form is a f orward contract. For 
example, an international bank granted a loan to a business in Malaysia. As the business repay s 
the bank in Malaysian ringgits, the international bank can use a forward contract to exchange 
ringgits for U.S. dollars at a future fixed exchange rate. Thus, the interna tional bank protects 
itself  from  the foreign exchange rate risk. A forward contract  contains the commod ity’s 
quantity , a fixed  price, and the future transaction date. Furthermore, a forward contract is a 
tailor -made contract, and international banks usually write forwards for foreign curren cies. 
Another derivative,  similar to a forward , is a futures contract. Futures contracts are standardized, 
and investors can buy or sell easily the contracts on the futures markets . Forwards and futu res 
have maturities of 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 months . 
Inter national banks and investors  use c urrency swaps to reduce exchange rate risk and 
lower transaction costs. A currency swap  is the exchange of debt instruments denominated in 
different currencies. For instance, a forward -forward swap  means a firm and a bank exchange  
two forward contracts with each other. Bank sells a forward contract for a specific currency to a 
firm, and the firm simultaneously sells a contract to the dealer for the opposite currency with the 
same maturity. Thus, a currency swap is similar to a loan with collateral from the bank, and it 
was a  $3.2 trillion market in April 2007.  
Intel, for example, wants to build a factory in Germany  while  Volkswagen wants to build a 
new factory in the United States.  Intel needs euros  while  Volkswagen needs U.S. dollars for 
these investments. These companies ar e well known  within their own countries and can borrow  
on favorable ter ms with their banks. A  U.S. bank  lends to Intel  while  a German bank lends to  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
54 
 Volkswagen . Now Intel and Volkswagen can exchange their loans, using curren cy swaps. Intel 
has euros  to buil d a factory in Germany  while  Volkswagen has U.S. dollars to build a factory in 
the United States.  The k ey to understanding a forward -forward  swap,  the exchange involves two 
cash flows, and  a forward contract protects  each cash flow.  
A popular currency swap  is a spot against a forward , and it  comprised  57% of trades in 
2004 . Investor s or bu sinessme n can protect themselves from the exchange rate risk by 
purchasing  currency from a bank on the spot market  today , and then they use a forward to 
transfer the same currency  back on a future date  for a fixed exchange rate. For example, an 
investor invests $10 million  in Malaysia. He buys ringgit currency from an international bank 
today and invests his money for one year in Malaysia. Afterwards, the investor cashes ou t his 
ringgits and exchanges his ringgits for U.S. dollar with the original bank using  a forward 
contract. Thus,  an investor  protects himself  from fluctuations in the exchange rate  because  he 
exchanged his  currency in the future for a known price . 
Internat ional banks and investors created another financial instrument , Eurodollars  that 
reduce  the foreign exchange rate risk . Banks create Eurodollars when a bank customer transfers 
a deposit from the United States to a foreign bank.  Then the  bank does not conve rt the account 
to the local currency, but keeps the account denominated in U.S. dollars.  The Soviet Union 
created Eurodollars  because  it accumulated  U.S. dollars  from selling petroleum to the 
international markets. The Soviet leaders wanted to hold U.S. do llars but not in U.S. banks . 
They we re afraid the U.S. government would seize them , and  they c onvinced European banks to 
hold accounts in U.S. dollars . 
Eurodollars allow banks to circumvent laws and regulations. In the United States , banks 
originally did  not pay interest on checking accounts. During the 1970s, depositors withdrew 
their funds from their checking accounts  as interest rates soared . In Britain, banks originally 
could not grant loans outside of Britain. Nevertheless, Eurodollars allowed these banks to 
circumvent these laws. U.S. banks could borrow Eurodollars from Britain instead relying on 
domestic deposits . The U.S. banks paid market interest rates on the Eurodollar  while  British 
banks could lend outside of Britain by using Eurodollars. Eurod ollars were so successful that 
many governments repealed regulations , and t he U.S. dollar still dominates  the Eurodollar 
market.  
Eurodollars are not limited to only Europe. During the 1970s, Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting  Countries (OPEC) had reduced  their production of petroleum, caus ing the oil price  to 
surge . High oil prices caused a large inflow of U.S. dollars into the OPEC nations, and OPEC 
became the largest source of Eurodollars. Currently, Japan and South Korea also have sizeable 
deposits in U .S. dollars. Nevertheless, many countries are alarmed at  the large U.S. debt and 
massive trade deficits that cause  an outflow of U.S. dollars into the international markets.  Many 
believe the U.S. dollar will depreciate. Accordingly, t he Federal Reserve sto pped publishing the 
M3 definition of the money supply in 2006  that measure d the quantity of Eurodollars.  
Eurodollars created  two offshoots:  Euroloans  and Eurobonds . Consequently , the principal 
and interest payments  for Euroloans and Eurobonds  are denominated in U.S. dollars. For 
example, a Europe an bank  lends  to a Russia n company , using an Euroloan. All terms of the loan 
are in dollars, and Russia must  repay the loan  in dollars. Thus, the bank protects itself  from Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
55 
 changes in the ruble -dollar e xchange rate  because the bank  pushes the exchange rate risk upon  
the Russian business. However, Euroloans and Eurobonds are not completely free from the 
exchange rate risk. If the Russian business earns profits from sales denominated in rubles, then a 
severe ruble depreciation can cause the Russian business to default and/or bankrupt. 
Subsequently, the business cannot afford to convert a depreciating currency into an appreciating 
one, and it defaults on the Euroloan.  
Banks can grant  Euroloans  in billions of  dollars.  Therefore, several international bank s 
cooperate  to grant a sizable  loan.  We call t his cooperation a  loan syndication . Syndicate spreads 
a large loan among several banks , and one bank manages the loan and earns a management fee.  
Most internationa l banking business is conducted through the Euromarkets . These markets 
remain  unregulated and include all financial markets that are denominated in U.S. dollars and 
are located outside of the United States.   
Last financial instrument,  a banker’s acceptance , facilitates international trade. If a U.S. 
store wants to import coffee from Costa Rica, the exporter in Cos ta Rica has  little information 
about the U.S. store’s credit worthiness. Furthermore, if the exchange of coffee for money 
occurs in the future, th e U.S. store does not know what the future exchange rate will be. Th us, 
this becomes  an information problem, and an international bank can use a banker’s acceptance. 
The U.S. store deposits money at its international bank. Bank guarantees payment by issuin g a 
banker’s acceptance and sends a letter of credit to the exporter in Costa Rica. If the U.S. store 
bankrupts, the exporter in Costa Rica still gets his money. If the firm does not deposit money at 
the bank and the bank guarantees payment, then the bank must  pay the exporter in Costa Rica. 
When the exporter in Costa Rica exports the coffee to the U.S., the exporter deposits his letter of 
credit at his bank. Exporter’s bank would  contact the U.S. store’s bank and arrange payment . 
Consequently, b anker’s acc eptances lower transaction costs and are liquid assets  because  banks 
and holders can sell or buy them on secondary markets.  
Regulatory Oversight  
After World War II, the U.S. dollar became the international transaction currency. An 
international transaction  currency  is the preferred currency used in negotiating transactions in 
the international financial markets. For example, traders negotiate all transactions i n the 
petrol eum market  in U.S. dollars.  
During the 1980s, several developing countries threaten t o default on their Euroloa ns. Loan 
default would  trigger  a global banking crisis in the industrialized countries. Consequently, 
twelve countries, includin g the United States met in Switzerland  to disc uss cap ital requirements. 
They named the meeting  after t he city, Basel. Basel committee  wanted  to ensure banks had 
enough capital to survive a financial crisis and  avoid  massive profit losses . Unfortunately, 
countries have difficulty in implementing the Basel agreement  because  every  country has 
distinctive regu lations and different accounting standards. Nevertheless, the Basal agreement set 
common capital standards for banks engaged in currency swaps, financial futures, and options.  
The 1980s debt crisis forced  central banks to meet and discuss their roles of be ing the 
lenders of last resort during a banking crisis.  Central banks concluded they should concentrate 
on the financial stability of their own domestic banks.  However, many banks are linked Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
56 
 internationally to other banks abroad.  Consequently, a banking crisis in one  country  can spread 
and trigger a ba nking crisis in another. Thus, one  central bank can not contain a  financial crisis.  
Leaders of central banks and government finance minis tries push for coordination and 
restrictions o n deposit insurance. For instance, deposit insurance in the United States insures up 
to $250,000 for each person. Other countries do not have generous  depo sit insurance . Currently, 
U.S. banks pay modest premiums only on domestic deposits. If the Federal De posit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) requires U.S. banks to pay deposit insurance on all accounts, including 
foreign accounts, then their premiums would increase. Furthermore, governments have two 
problems coordinating  internationa l deposit insurance . First,  many  regulatory agencies in other 
countries lack the FDIC ’s monitoring power . Second, only three countries in Europe, 
Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom, have laws requiring the government to step in and 
fund the deposit insurance  if the insurance pre miums cannot cover all accounts during a bank 
failure . 
The United States and many countries were deregulating , when the 2008 Financial Crisis 
struck  the world economy.  The United States, Ireland, Spain, and many countries experienced a 
strong real estate b ubble that deflated in 2007. As  the unemployment rate soared , businesses lay 
off many people, and the unemployed  could not find jobs. Subsequently, some people stopped 
paying their mortgages, harming the banks financially. Banks stopped granting new mortga ges, 
and brand new housing construction has halted . Afterwards, the h ousing prices began falling as 
the banks foreclose  on houses that are  losing value.  
The U.S. governme nt responded quickly, using  the identical  response many other countries 
had used . 
 
 The U.S. government purchased preferred stock in the largest banks in the United States, 
infusing the banks with  funds. T he first time the U.S. government started ownership in a 
business  directly . 
 The Federal Reserve bought many of the toxic mortgage loans fr om the banks , removing 
the bad debt from their books . A toxic loan  is a bank granted  a mortgage to a family or 
person with no credit history or poor credit. Toxic loans became  the first loans to sour as  
the world’ s economy entered the 2007 Great R ecession . Toxic loans were called subprime 
loans before the financial crisis  because banks earned enormous profits . 
 The Federal Reserve is rapidly expanding the money supply to offset the declines in the 
U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve also granted trillions of dollars in emergency loans to 
the U.S. banks.  
 The Federal Reserve became the lender of the last resort for the developed world. Central 
banks from Britain, European Union, and Japan can borrow U.S. dollars from the Federal 
Reserve through the U.S. dollar l iquidity  swap . A U.S. dollar liquidity  swap  is a central 
bank can borrow U.S. currency from the Federal Reserve by giving its own currency as 
collateral. Then on the maturity date, the central bank repays its loan in U.S. dollars, and 
the Fed returns the c urrency . This is similar to a  forward -forward transaction.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
57 
  The U.S. government plans to implement the Basel III requirements that increase banks’ 
capital requirements and  force banks to boost their  holdings of liquid securities. During the 
housing bubble, many banks increased their leverage ratio to unsustainable levels. 
Unfor tunately, leverage has several meanings depending on its context . Leverage , in our 
case, equals  the ratio of debt  a business uses  to acquire d assets. Many banks accumulated 
debt to acq uire properties  at the peak of the housing bubble. Once the bubbl e deflated, the 
property fell  in value, and the banks could not sell it withou t enormous losses. Banks had 
high leverage ratios as they accumulated debt for assets with falling market values.  If 
banks hold  more capital or hold more liquid assets, then they would have more capital to 
deal with a financial crisis.  
Effects of the 2008 Financial Crisis still plague  the world’s economy. A lthough the Great 
Recession had ended in 2009,  many developed countries are on the verge of entering a new 
recession  in 2014 . Consequently, banks  tightened their lending  standards while  new housing 
construction remains at a standstill. Many countries including Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, 
Greece, Sp ain, and the United States are afflicted with an unemployment crisis  because  the 
unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, and the unemployed cannot find work. Thus , 
government regulations and regulatory differenc es among countries will diminish  because  
governments want to avoid an economic cris is like the  2008  Financial Crisis .

 5. Financial Institutions  
Financial analysts and economists classify t he financial markets and institutions  into five 
categories : securities market institutions , investments institutions, contractual savings 
institutions, deposito ry institutions, and governm ent financial institutions. Thus, students  will 
study  the prominent characteristi cs of each category  and understand how a financial institution 
from one category  differs from  another category . Unfortunately, these categories are  not etched 
into stone  because  a financial company could be classified under two or more categories . Since  
the 1980s, the U.S. federal government started  deregulating the financial markets allowing  the 
financial institutions to expand  into new activities  as they cross into other categories . 
Consequently, financial institutions began competing fiercely as  financial institutions in one 
secto r started competing with  institutions in other sectors.  For instance, a company could expand 
across  three categories b ecause it offer s banking services , sell s insurance, and becomes a broker  
for financial securities . 
Securities Market Institutions  
Securities market institutions include  investment bankers, brokers, dealers, and organized 
exchanges. These institutions enhan ce the liqui dity of the secondary markets. However, t hese 
institutions are not financial intermediaries , and they do not link the savers to the borrowers. 
Instead, the securities market institutions help the savers locate the borrowers.  
Prominent sec urities market institution is the  investment bank. An investment bank  helps 
corporations issue new stock and bonds, or it helps a local or state government issues new 
bonds. Furthermore, an investment bank could help a corporation take over another. 
Consequentl y, the  investment bank influences  the primary market  heavily . In the United State s, 
an investment ban k is not a regular bank. It serves as a  marketing agent for new securi ties. For 
example, Ford wants to build a new factory and decides to issue new stock. New stock will 
provide funds that Ford can use to build the factory. Ford will go to an investment bank , and the 
investment bank will assist Ford in creating the new securities. The n the investment bank  sells 
these new Ford stock  to customers. If these cus tomers wan t to sell  their stock , subsequently,  
they sell them on the secondary markets  or organized exchanges. Some prestigious investment 
banks include  Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse .  
The U.S. government passed the Glass –Steagall Act of 1933 to separate the functions of 
commercial and investment banking. A commercial bank is a standard bank that accepts 
deposit s and makes loans. Many countries, such as the European Union, Great Britain, and 
South Korea do not legally separate commercial a nd investment banking. Then the U.S. 
government repealed parts of the Glass -Steagall Ac t in 1999  and allowed U.S. investment banks 
to branch into commercial banking and insurance, so they could compe te internationally. 
Unfortunately , the largest commercial  and investment banks in the w orld teetered on bankruptcy 
during  the 2008 Financial Crisis . Consequently , many government leaders across the world  are 
debating to enact similar laws to the Glass -Seagall Act.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
60 
 Process of issuing new stock is called underwrit ing. Underwriting  lowers information costs. 
Investment bank guar antees a stock or bond price to the  corporation. T hen the investment bank  
sells the new stock or bon d for a high er price. Greater  price reflects  the investment banker’s 
profit. Furthermore, i nvestment ba nks may work together, which we call  syndicates . One 
investment ba nk acts as the manager and retains  part of the profits while other investment banks 
help sell the new securities.  
The U.S. government requires investment bankers to disclose information to investors,  
helping to prevent risk and fraud. Unfortunately, i nvestment bankers have  access to  inside 
information  about corporate mergers. When a corporation takes over another corp oration, the 
merger causes the c ompany’s stock price to soar. Thus, i nvestment bankers can secretly buy 
stock or share information with friends  and family who buys that particular stock . Insiders can 
earn a substantial  amount of profit , and it is illegal i n the United States . The Securities Exchange 
Commission has the authority to investigate and to prosecute  these cases.  
Investors can buy or sell corporate stock through  organized exchanges . Exchanges are 
secondary markets , and they increase the liquidity o f securities. We define organized exchanges  
as either an exchange or over -the-counter market. A n exchange  has a physical location, and 
buyers and sellers of securities meet face to face. Only members, called specialist , can enter 
these exchanges. For examp le, if you wan t to buy Coca -Cola stock, you must  contact a broker 
who contact s a specialist a t the New York Stock Exchange. Subsequently, t he specialist matches 
prices and quantity of sto ck for buyers and sellers. Consequently, t he broker and specialist ea rn 
commission from each transaction. Oldest and largest U.S. corporations are listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange, while un known corporations are listed on American Stock Exchange.  
Over-the-counter (OTC) market does not have a physical location. Telephon es and 
computers connect the dealers and brokers together. Both new and  small firms are  traded in the 
over-the-counter market. The OTC market in the United States is the National As sociation of 
Securities Dealers’  Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) , or commonly referred to as NASDAQ . 
New high -tech firms , such as Texas Instruments  had started in NASDAQ  and eventually 
switched their listing to  a major exchange . Europe has their equivalent of NASDAQ, which the 
Europeans call EASDAQ.  
Many countries removed the barriers  to their financial markets , allow ing international 
companies to sell or buy stock  in their countries. For example, a German investor can buy U.S. 
corporate stock like GE and IBM on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, while an American investor 
can buy Japanese stock for Honda Motors and Sony on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Consequently, the financial markets are truly global , and link savers and investors  together 
across the world . 
Financial analys ts compile market indices that  measure  broad movements in a financial 
market. Most popular and the oldest stock market index used today is the Dow Jones Industrial 
Averages , otherwise known simply as the “Dow” or “the industrials.” The Wall Street Journal 
invented the  Dow in 1882, and it calculates the Dow by a weighted average of 30 representative 
stocks of New York Stock Exchange . The Dow  includes Coca -Cola, IBM, Proctor & Gamble, 
and Exxon. Analysts at the Wall Street Journal adjust the Dow for corporate mergers, corporate 
bankruptci es, and stock splits. Another popular market index is Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
61 
 500). Standard & Poor’s index includes 500 stocks  that are listed  on the Stock Market 
Exchange . We list the m ajor stock exchanges in the world  in Table 1 along with their ma rket 
indices.

Market indices provide two benefits. First, the market indices provide fast information. 
Financial analysts calculate a market index in seconds and di stribute the index to investors 
instantly. Second, private companies calculate the market indices. Thus, government does not 
influence the numbers .  
A stock market, occasionally, experiences a rapid drop in stock pri ces, which  precipitate a 
stock market cr ash. A stock market crash  means  a dramatic drop in stock prices during a short 
time period. Unfortunately, a stock market crash bankrupts investment companies, insurance 
companies, pension funds, and commercial banks. Although commercial banks are not dire ctly 
involved with the stock market, they may have grant ed loans to investors who cannot repay. 
Finally, a stock market crash in one market can trigger anot her stock market crash, even  a stock 
market located in a foreign country.  
Stock market crash  became  the prelude to the Great Depression. In 1929, the stock market 
crashed on October 24, October 28, and October 29. Afterwards, the unemployment rate peaked 
at 26% in the United States. Moreover, the New York Stock Exchange crashed on October 19, 
1987. The D ow Jones fell by 508 points (or 27 .8%) in one day, the largest loss in U.S. history . 
However, the United States did  not enter  a recession because the Federa l Reserve came to the 
rescue, providing  emergency loans to the financial institutions. Then the Unit ed States 
experienced a stock market crash in March 2000, which triggered the 2001 Recession. Many 
people call this  the dot -com crash because stock value for many internet companies became 
worthless overnight. Finally, the U.S. experienced the 2007 Great R ecession , which became  the Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
62 
 most severe recession since the Great Depression. Your author calls this the 2008 Financial 
Crisis , when  pandemonium struck the financial world . 
A stock market crash occurs from  a financial bubble. A bubble  is a dramatic, rapid rise in 
asset prices. As the asset prices reach a peak, then the prices rapidly fall, bankrupting financial 
institutions that became  caught in the market. The United States along with other industrial 
countries experienced a strong re al estate bubble that popped in 2007. Collapsing housing 
bubble triggered both the 2007 Great Recession and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Unfortunately, 
real estate prices began  falling while  both foreclosures and the unemployed were soaring . 
Consequently, bo th the investment banks and commercial banks earned enormous losses from 
the mortgage market as homeowners stopped paying their mortgages. Banks refused to lend to 
anyone, causing a credit crunch. A credit crunch  means  financial institutions stop lending t o 
themselves and the public, disrupting business activities, such as construction and 
manufacturing.  
Investment banks became involved in mortgages because they packaged mortgages into 
new exotic securities, which was tremendously profitable before 2 007. Th en stock prices began 
plummet ing during 2008 until they had lost half their value. Some banks were particular ly hit 
hard like Ci tigroup and Bank of America as their stocks traded  below $1 per share, which was a 
significant drop. Investment bank, Lehman Bro thers, declared bankruptcy, and it closed its 
doors to the financial world. Unfortunately, many Americans were on the verge of retirement, 
and many experienced a 50% or more decline in their pension funds, causing many  workers  to 
delay retirement. ( We stud y the 2008 Financial Crisis  in detail in Chapter 18 after students learn 
derivatives.)  
Stock market embodies more psychology than logic . Investors are human! When investors 
see the Dow Jones soaring , they invest more money into the stock market. As investo rs dump 
more money  into the stock mark et, the stock prices continue rising . If investors see the stock 
market prices began  falling, then they  pull their money out of the stock m arket, and stock prices 
continue  falling. If stoc kholders become afraid, they  cash in all their stocks at once, causing the 
stock prices to plummet. Thus, the market moves  in cycles, being  driven by  public’s psychology 
and their expectations about future  stock prices . 
Investment Institutions  
Investment i nstitutions  include  mutual funds and finance companies. A mutual fund  
manager groups together funds from many investors  and invest s the mo ney in a variety of 
stocks. Consequently, a mutual fund diversifies  stocks, and it lowers investors’ risk. For 
example, you start your ow n mutual fund and offer investors a chance to invest in this fund. You 
take the money and buy 30 different corporate  stocks. The Coca -Cola stock rises  one day  while  
the value of IBM stock falls . Overall, the average of th e fund’s 30 stocks should  earn a re turn to 
your fund and to the investors.  If you bought only Kmart corpo rate stock , you would  lose your 
investment if this company bankrupts.  
Mutual fund companies have different strategies and characteristics , and well -known 
mutual fund companies include  Fidelity, Vanguard, and Dreyfus . Mutual fund companies 
develop strategies where they only  buy stock in certain industries, large companies, or foreign Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
63 
 company ’s stock. Furthermore, t he mutual fund company may issue a fixed number of shares to 
the fund  that we call  closed -end mutual funds . Then  investors may buy and sell these shares in 
over-the-counter markets, just like stock. Th us, th e mutual fund company does not buy its shares 
back for closed -end mutual funds. A  mutual fund company may offer another alternative called 
open -ended mutual funds . Mutual fund company can  buy back shares to the fund , and the price 
of the shares becomes  tied to the value of the stock in the fund . Finally, the m utual fund 
managers use tw o methods to earn profits . First, fund managers c harge management fees  for no-
load funds , usually 0.5% of asset value . For the s econd  method , the fund managers charge a 
commission for selling or purchasing of shares  for load funds . The load reflects  the co mmission 
that lowers the fund’s value.  
Money -market mutual funds  are similar to mutual funds. However, the fund manager buys 
only money market securities, and the fund excludes corporate stock. Theory behind money -
market mutual funds is simple. If you have  five friends with $2,000 each , and they want  to buy a 
Treasury bill with a minimum face value of  $10,000, then your friends can pool their money 
together and buy on e T-bill. Once the T -bill matured , your friends split the interest among 
them selves . 
Money -market mutual funds are very popular  because  these funds offer check -writing 
privileges, and  some investors do not want to tie up their funds for a long time. Moreover, the 
value of the fund does not change much, when interest rates changes  because  money market 
securities have maturities less than one year. In 2008, money -market mutual funds had assets of 
$3.8 trillion.  
Commercial banks offer money market deposit accounts  that are similar to  the mone y-
market mutual fund . Two funds differ because  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) insures the money market deposit accounts, while it does not insure money -market 
mutual funds . If your bank bankrupted  and you invested in money market deposit ac counts, 
subsequently, you are guaranteed not  to lose you funds up to the maximum insured amount.   
Finance  companies  are another  investment institution, and they raise money by selling 
stock, bonds, and commercial paper. Commercial paper is a short -term loan with a maximum 
maturity of 270 days, and a  well-known bank or corporation  can issue  it. Commercial paper is a 
form of direct finance and has no collateral. Furthermo re, finance companies lend to consumers 
for furniture, appliances, cars, home -improvement loans, or the y lend to small business es. Some 
corporations created  their own finance companies to  help consumers buy their product s. For 
example, General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) lends money to people, so they can 
buy cars from General  Motors (GM). However, GM sold its  51% stake in GMAC  to Cerberus 
Capital Management in 2006. Then GMAC expanded into the mortgage market and w as caught 
in the 2008 financial storm , when the housing bubble deflated. Currently, GMAC was renamed 
Ally Bank in 2010 and became  part of the bank holding company,  Ally Financial , Inc. 
Contractual Saving  
Contractual saving i nstitutions  are insurance companies and pension funds. Insurance 
companies  provide protection for people who buy insurance policies. Insurance policy prevents 
financial hardship, such as  a medica l emergency, car accident, or the death of a family member. Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
64 
 Insurance companies are financial intermediaries  because  they link the funds from the 
policyholders to the financial markets. Policyholders make periodical payments to the insurance 
company called  premiums . Insurance company will invest the premiums in the financial 
markets. For the insurance company to earn a profit, the amount of interest earned in the 
financial markets plus the  total amount of premiums must  exceed  the amount paid for claims. 
Largest insurance companies include  Allstate, Aetna, and Prudential. Most states established 
commissions that regulate insurance companies. Commissions may  limit premiums, minimize 
fraud, and prevent the insurance companies from investing in risky securities.  
Insurance companies use the law of large numbers  as they insure a large number of people. 
On average, statisticians can predict an insurance company’s pay out in claims  because they, on 
average,  accurately predict the rate s of death, illness, injury, and property damage for an entire 
country. Statisticians do not know which specific individuals will experience hardship, but they 
can predict how often it occurs. Unfortunately, i nsurance companies have two problems, when 
selling insurance policies: Adverse s election and moral hazard. Adverse selection  means  a 
person buying  insurance has more information than the insurance company. For example, a 
person knows he has a heart problem and decides to buy a very large life insurance policy , and 
he hides this inform ation . Moral hazard  means  people buying  insurance becomes more careless  
than when they did not have  insurance . For instance, a person buys theft insurance for his home, 
and this person stops locking his windows and doors when he leaves, increasing the risk  a 
burglar will break into his home.  
Insurance companies use two strategies to combat  moral hazard and adverse selection . First, 
insurance companies gather  information about the policyholders, such as driving records, 
medical records, and credit histories.  Consequently, t he insurance company charge s a higher 
premium to a p erson who is  likely to file  a claim , which we call  a risk-based premium . Second, 
insurance companies use  a deductible . When a person makes a claim, the person must pay  the 
first portion . For example, a person buys health insura nce with a $500 deductible. After  this 
person has paid  the first $500  to a doctor , then the insurance company pays the remainder of the 
claim. This passes some of the responsibility to the person holding the insurance  policy.  Finally, 
a person could buy insuranc e with smaller premiums but with  a greater deductible.  
First type of insurance company is a  life insurance company . These companies  purchase 
long-term corporate bonds and commercial mortgages  because  they can pr edict future payments 
with high accuracy. Furthermore, the insurance companies are organized in two ways: Mutual 
company or stock company. Insurance policyholders own  a mutual company  because  the 
insurance policy functions as corporate stock , while a stock  company  is a corporation that  issues 
stock. Thus, the shareholders own the company, while the insurance policyholders do not. Stock 
company is more common  because  a stock company has more  funding  sources . They receive 
funding by selling stock to shareholders, and receive revenue by selling insurance policies. Most 
polic ies issued are called term life policies . Person buying t he life insurance must  pay the 
premium for the rest of his life. These policies are popular  because  the policyholder can bor row 
against the value of the life insurance policy, when he retires. Borrowing against insurance  is an 
annuity. An annuity  pays a retired person a specific amount of money each year.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
65 
 Second type of insurance company is property and casualty insurance compa nies. They are 
organized as either a stock company or mutual  company, and they insure against theft, floods, 
illness, fire, earthquakes, and car accidents. These companies tend to purchase liquid , short -term 
assets  because  these companies cannot accurately  predict the amount of future claims. Insurance 
companies charge premiums that correspond to the chance of the event occurring. For example , 
a homeowner in California would  pay a higher premium for earthquake insurance than a 
homeowner in the Midwest of th e United States  because  California experiences more 
earthquakes.  
Pension funds  are another  contractual saving s institution . Many people  save money for 
retirement, and p ension funds become a vital form of saving. Some employers sponsor p ension 
funds as a jo b benefit,  or workers  can voluntarily pay into personal retirement accounts. Then 
the f inancial companies manage the pension funds , and they invest pension funds into the 
financial markets. Pension fund managers can accurately predict when people will retire and 
usually invest in long -term securities, such as stocks, bonds, and mortgages. A person can only 
receive b enefits from the pension fund after the person becomes  vested . Vested  means 
employees  must work for their employer for a time period before they can receive the benefits 
from  the pension plan. Time perio d varies for the pension fund s. For example, s ome city 
governments require a person to be employed by the city fo r 10 years before t his person 
becomes  100% vested in the city’s pension plan.  
Employers have three reasons to offer pension plans to employees. First, the pension fund 
managers can more efficiently manage the fund, lowering the pension funds’ transaction costs. 
Second, the pension funds may offer benefits such as life annuities. A life annuity is a worker 
contributes money into the annuity until he retires. Then the worker receives regular payments 
every year from the annuity until his death. Life annuities could be  expensiv e if a worker buys  
them individually. However, a large employer with many employees can request discounts from 
pension plans. Finally, the governme nt does  not tax the pension fund  as workers invest funds  
into it, allowing the fund to grow faster. Neverthel ess, government usually imposes taxes on 
withdrawa ls from a pension fund . If the employer offered higher wages and no pension plan s to 
the employees, then the government taxes the greater income, reducing the amount an employee 
could invest into a retireme nt plan.  
Employers have two choices for the ownership of a pension plan. First, e mployees own the 
value of the funds in the pension plan , called a defined contribution plan . If the pension fund is 
profitable, subsequently, the ret ired employees will  receiv e great er pension income. If the 
pension fund is not profitable, then the retired employees will receive a low pension income. 
Companies that have a defined -contribution plan are likely to invest the pension funds into the 
companies’ own stock. That way, e mployees have an incentive to be more productive  because  
the value of their pension plan depends on their company’s profitability. However, this pension 
fund becomes dangerous if this company bankrup ts. Then the employees own worthless stock . 
One infamous case was the Enron collapse in 2001. Some employees were millionaires until 
their stock portfolios collapsed in value overnight. Second , the most comm on type of plan is the 
defined -benefit plan . An employer promises a worker  a specific amount of benefits that are 
based on the employee’s earnings and years of service to the company. If this pension fund is Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
66 
 profitable, the company pays  the promised benefits and retains the  remaining funds  that are not 
paid to the retired employees. If the pension fund is unp rofitable, then the company pays the 
promised benefit s out of its own pocket.  
Federal and state governments regulate the pension funds. Regulations require the managers 
of the pension funds to disclose all investments. That way, employees know which securi ties the 
pension fund managers  have invested in. Regulations help preve nt fraud and mismanagement. 
Unfortunately, a  pension fund  will bankrupt, when the company  where the employees work 
bankrupt s. Co nsequently, Co ngress created the Pension Ben efit Guaranty  Corporation that  
insures pension fund benefits up to a limit if the company cannot meet its obligations. Some 
economists believe a pension fund disaster will occur  for state and local government retirees 
after 2012. Many state  and local governments offere d generous defined -benefit plans to  public 
employees, and they have not placed  enough  money aside to fund the pension plans .  
A recent t rend in pension funds allows  employees to  manage their own pension plans, 
which  are the 401(k) plans. The 401(k) refers to a section of law in the Internal Revenue 
Service’s regulations , and t he benefit of this pension plan is the employee can take his pension 
plan wit h him when he switches employers . However, t he 401(k) has one risk. Amount of 
money a person has accumulate d at retirement depends upon how much money he invested in 
the plan and how w ell the investments have done.  
Depository Institutions  
Depository institutions  accept deposit s and make loans. Thus, they include  intermediaries 
that link the savers to borrowers. Commercial banks  are the largest and dominate the depository 
institutions. Many borrowers seek bank loans for mortgages, car loans, or credit cards. Savers 
have three reasons to dep osit their savings in a bank tha n invest directly into the financial 
markets. First, the bank deposits are liquid. A depositor can quickly exchange his bank deposit 
for cash. Second, the ba nks gather information about their  borrowers, lowering the ris k of loan 
default. Banks hire  financial specialist who monitors investments. On the other hand, a n investor 
would spend much time and effort to monitor his or her investments in the financial markets. 
Finally, banks reduce the risk by lending to a variety of borrowers.  Consequently, c ommercial 
banks are important for a community because it s role of accepting deposits and granting loans.  
Savings  institutions  are another  depository institution. Originally, these institutions 
accepted deposits and  granted  low-cost mortgages for home buyers . During the early 1980s, 
many savings institutions experienced financial crisis  because  of higher interest rates. For 
example, if you borrowed $10,000 at a 5%, interest rate and lo aned it out at 10%, then you earn 
a profit. However,  if you borrowed $10,00 0 at 10%  interest rate and loaned it o ut at 5%, 
subsequently, you  earn a loss. Unfortunately, this  happened to the saving i nstitutions . Interest 
rates rose  during the 1980s  as the savings institutions paid  a greater interest rate to the 
depositors than the amount of these institutions earned on the mortgages. Mortgages  are usually 
30-year loans , and savings institutions were locked into low interest rates from the 1960s. 
Currently, savings institutions are similar to banks, except different government agencies 
regulate the savings institutions.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
67 
 Credit unions  are another  depository ins titution. Credit unions are  similar to commercial 
banks except  they restrict  membership . Credit union extends m embership to pe ople who shar e a 
common interest. Usually  people work for a particular company or industry. For example, many 
states have credit unions for school teachers. These  institutions only allow school teachers to 
open accounts. Originally, credit unions offered sav ings deposits and made consum er loans for 
cars and boats. Currently , credit unions evolved  similar ly to banks , and they offer the same 
services, such as checking accounts and loans for mortgages. Some credit unions lessened their 
member restrictions  as they compete directly with banks. Consequently, the commercial banks 
want credit un ions on equal grounds with  commercial banks  because  a credit union  does not pay 
income taxes on its  profit . 
Government Financial Institutions  
Federal, state, and local governme nts in the United States create  government financial 
institution s that lend funds  to the public . First, The U.S. government uses direct financing , when 
it creates a public corporation that sells bonds and commercial paper to investors in the financial 
marke ts. Then the public company uses the investors’ money to  lend to borrowers directly. For 
example, the Farm Credit System, a U.S. government agency, lends to farmers. Farmers use 
these loans  to finance growing  crops,  equipment, o r mortgage loans. Secon d, the U.S. 
government lends money  to students who pursue  a college  education. For example , the Student 
Loan Market Association , known as  Sallie Mae,  lends directly to students or buy s student loans 
from banks. Finally , the Federal National Mortgage Associ ation  (Fannie Mae)  and Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Fre ddie Mac)  grant mortgages to low -income households . 
They also buy and sell mortgages to boost  the liquidity of  the mortgage loan market . 
For t he secon d method,  a gove rnment can lend to the p ublic  through loan gu arantees, which 
is similar to  insurance. For example, a bank  lends to a student to pay for an education, and the 
U.S. Department of Education guarantee s the loan. If the student defaults, subsequently, the 
U.S. Department of Education repays the loan to the bank, and then the U.S. governm ent uses its 
authority to  collect from the student.  
Some people question a  government’s role in finan cing. When a  government directly lends , 
the government squeezes  the financial institutions out of the loan market. Further more , the 
federal government loan guarantees increase the problem of moral hazard. Financial institutions 
receiving the loan guarantees might  not screen b orrowers as much, lending  to borrowers w ith a 
high default risk. For example, t he effects of the 2007 Great Recession continue to linger i n the 
U.S. economy, even in  2014 . Recessio n caused mass layoffs and doubled the unemployment 
rate. Then the housing values continue to plummet  while  foreclosures  continue  soaring. 
Cons equently, the U.S. government might be  liable for trillions of dollars in loan guarantees and 
bailout of public corporations.  We explain several examples  below:  
 
 The U.S. Department of Education, Sall ieMae, and commercial banks grant ed college 
student loans that had surpassed $1 trillion in 2012. Unfortunately, college graduates 
continue to enter an abysmal job market in 2013 . Student -loan default rate hovers around 
24%. College students, on average, owe  approximately $24,000  while law school graduates Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
68 
 accumulate loans exceeding a $100,000.  Unfortunately, a stagnant economy w ould force 
the U.S. government to pay billions in loan guarantees.  
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  hold roughly  $6 trillion in mortgages, comprising  half the 
mortgages in the United States . The U .S. government  had seized  these two institutions in 
2008,  and it has spent  billions of dollars to bail them out . Bailout cost will continue to soar 
if the U.S. economy does not recover. Unfortunately, t he U.S. government helped c reate 
this mess because it encouraged  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to grant mortgages t o low -
income households, who become  vulnerable to downturns in the economy.

 6. Financial Statements and the Value of Money  
This chapter provides an overview o f financial statements and the value of money.  Business 
people  and financial analysts use and examine  four financial statements: the income statement, 
balance sheet, statement of changes to stockholder’s equity, and statement of cash flow.  Since 
all accoun tants record financial statements in  a curre ncy, then they must discount future 
payments and re ceipts of money using  the present value  formula . Consequent ly, students will 
learn  to use t he present value formula to compute  a value today of future withdrawals, 
payments, and investments.  Furthermore , students  will learn  to use  the present value formula to 
calculate the amortization table for a mortgage, annuity payments, value of savings accounts, 
and investments . Then  we exp and the present value formula for foreign currency.   
The Financial Statements  
Accountants use and create  four financial statements.  Income statement is the first and most 
important financial statement  because i nvestors must know whether  a business has earned a 
profit or a loss.  We also call a profit the  net income , and every income statement has two items:  
 
 Revenues  are inflows of assets received in exchan ge for goods and services that  the 
business produces.  Businesses earn revenue by selling  products or s ervices.  
 Expenses  are outflows of assets because a business pay s costs to operate a  business.  A 
business must  pay workers’ salaries, materials, taxes, and utilities.  
We show a n example of an incom e statement  in Table 1. PEMEX  is Mexico’s Petroleum 
Company , and the p refers to the Mexican currency, the peso.  The M exican government owns 
PEMEX after it  established PEMEX as  a monopoly over all Mexican petroleum production, 
refining, and distribution.  We omitted some categories  to simplify the income statement.  In 
2005, PEMEX’s net sales were 505,109,185 pesos for domestic sales and 423,533,791 pesos for 
exports.  Thus, PEMEX sold 505 million peso products within Mexico and exported 423 million 
pesos of petroleum to the United States.   
Next category is PEMEX’s ope rating costs, and they are separated into three categories. 
First, PEMEX incurred a cost of sales of 361,177,339 pesos for petroleum production, refining, 
and distribution. Cost of sales is the cost PEMEX pays to supply its customers with petroleum 
and pet roleum products. Second, PEMEX paid 21,910,789 pesos  to transport its products 
between  its facilities or retail markets. Furthermore, the corporation paid  46,800,391 pesos  to 
administer  the corporation . Finally, we add  all costs and write negative numbers as a red number 
in a parenthesis.  
Exchange gain (or loss) influences  the company  financial ly because  a country’s exchange 
rate had changed. International petroleum market  is denominated in U.S. dollars , and PEMEX 
sold petroleum to the United States for U.S . dollars and exchanged dollars to pesos. Thus, Money, Banking, and International Finance

 PEMEX experienced a gain of 17,627,605  pesos from currency exchange. Thus, th e U.S. dollar 
must have appreciated again st the Mexican peso during 2005 .

The M exican national government relies on PEMEX to pay taxes because  the company paid 
580,629,293 pesos in taxes and duties. Consequently, PEMEX earned a 64,265,231 peso loss 
because it paid a large amount of taxes  to the Mexican government. If you want to know the 
approximate U.S. dollar value, then divide all numbers in the Table 1 by 11  because  the peso -
dollar exchange rate roughly  equaled  $1 = 11 pesos  in 2005 . 
Balance Sheet  is the second financial statement and shows the financial position of a 
business on a specific date.  Balance sheet itemizes a business’s assets, li abilities, and equity.  
Assets  are economic resources owned by a business  while  liabilities  are debts and financial 
obligations of the business.  Finally, equity  equals  total assets minus total liabilities  that we also 
call net assets.  We express equity  in Equation 1. Moreover, c reditors want businesses to have a 
positive equity.  If a business cannot repay its debts, the creditors can legally force the business 
to sell its assets to repay  debts. We list several assets and liabilities  in Table 2. 
 
Equity = Total A ssets – Total Liabilities        (1) 
 
A corporation divides its equity into two capital accounts: Contributed Capital and Retained 
Earnings. Contributed Capital  is the amount of capital that a corporation sold. In other wor ds, 
the amount of stock tha t circulates between  investors outside of the corporation. Table 3 shows 
stockholders’ equity for preferred stock and common stock. We list the a mounts of authorized 
and outstanding shares  for both stock types. When a corporation earns profits,  it records the Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
72 
 profits in  the Retained Earnings  account. Subsequently, a corporation can us e retained earnings 
to finance  expansions or pay dividends to investors.

Accountants divide a company’s assets  into current and fixed assets . We show an example  
in Table 4 for Stores US A. Current assets  include cash, accounts receivable, merchandise 
inventory, and prepaid expenses.  They  are important because a business nee ds these assets to 
operate the  daily business . On the other hand, fixed assets  include  buildings, plants, and 
equipment  with long life  spans . Stores USA has a store and office equipment  valued at $25,000 
and $4,000 respectively.  Accountants subtract the  accumu lated depreciation  from the equipment  
because  equipment becomes old and deteriorates . Depreciation equals  $5,500 for the store 
equipment and $1,500 for the office equipment.  
Accountants divide The Stores USA  liabilities  into current liabilities and long -term debt. 
Current liabilities  are debts and obligations that are less than a year and include accounts 
payable, notes payable, and  income taxes. Long -term debt includes all  debt with maturities 
greater than a year such as  corporate bonds. Stores USA  has no long term liabilities. 
Furthermore, the corporation issued 10,000 s hares for $50 per share and earned income of 
$6,500 under reta ined earnings listed under Stockholders’ Equity. Board of di rectors can pay 
dividends from  this account or finance an expansion of the business. Finally, the total assets 
equal the total liabilities plus shareholders’ equity , conforming to Equation 1 .

The Statement of Changes in  the Owner’s Equity is the third financial statement and shows 
the changes in the owner’s equity.  For all business organizations, profits or net income always 
increases equity  because  the organization has more resourc es flowing into it. However, 
proprietors and partners could invest and/or withdraw from the business.  Thus, i nvestment 
increases the equity,  while withdrawals reduce it.  For corporations, the Statement of Changes in 
the Owner’s Equity is called the Statement of Retained E arnings.  We show an example  in Table 
5 for XYZ Corporation.  Profits or net income increases retained earnings , while dividends 
declared decreases it.  Dividends are similar  to a proprietor’s or partner s’ withdrawals . If the 
corporation issues more stock, th en the corporation increases investment and records this 
transaction  under  the Stockholders’ Equity.  
Statement of Cash Flows  is the last financial statement and shows the money inflows and 
outflows of a business. This statement is important  because  a busin ess needs adequate cash to 
operate such as paying workers, taxes, rent, and interest payments. A corporation could have a 
strong balance sheet, excellent income growth , but it  fails from poor cash flows. Table 6 lists the Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
74 
 activities that cause cash inflows and outflows. Financial analysts view the cash flow statement 
importantly  because  futur e business expansion  impact s the cash flows over time. Furthermore, a 
company could  be financially healthy, but poor cash flow s impose  hardship on the business. For 
example, if an employer cannot pay worker s’ wages, then some workers quit and leave the 
employer .

We show a  Statement o f Cash Flows  in Table 7 . If cash enters a  business, th en the cash 
flow is positive. As  cash leaves a business, subsequently, the cash flow is negative. Furthermore, 
the cash flow statement has three sections: operating, investing, and financing activities. For 
example, the business received $100, 000 from customers and paid $20,000 in taxes for the 
operating activities. The $100,000 is net cash r eceived from customers, which equal  total cash 
sales minus merchandise returns. Then the business invested in the business by purchasing 
$20,000 in new equ ipment for the investment activities. Finall y, the business issued  $50,000 in 
brand new stock  to expand the business  and p aid $30,000 in dividends for  financing activities. 
Consequently, the business has $110,000 in total cash at  the end of the year . You c an calculate 
this amount by starting with the cash on hand at the beginning of the year and add the net cash 
flow that the business received during the year.

Single Investment  
Financial analysts use the present value formula to price financial securities or calculate 
mortgage payments.  Present value formula places a value of future cash flows in terms of 
money today.  Therefore, the  present value emphasizes the present  because  people want their 
money now than wait for a future payment.  Consequently, a n interes t rate  reward s savers  for 
delaying payment . For example, if you deposit $100 into a bank at 5% interest rate, you earn 
interest:  
 
 After one year, you earn 0.05($100) = $5 in interest.  Your ending balance becomes  
$105.00.  
 After two years, you earn 0.05($105 .00) = $5.25.  Your ending balance grows into  $110.25.  
We can use i nterest compounding to compute the ending balance  in Equation 2 . 
 
$100 (1+0.05)(1+0.05)=$100 (1+0.05)ଶ=$110 .25     (2) 
 
If you let the money earn inter est after T years, then you build the sequence in Equation 3. 
In this c ase, we multiply the beginning  balance  by the interest  repeatedly . Moreover, the one 
inside the parenthesis indicates the principal  as $1  while  the 0.05 reflects  the interest.  
 
$100 (1+0.05)(1+0.05)⋯(1+0.05)=$100 (1+0.05)்    (3) 
 
For example , your $100 grows into $13,150.13 at 5% intere st in one -hundred years . We 
write the m athematical notation as: 
 
 Future Value ( FV) in dollars  at Time T.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
76 
  Present Value ( PV) in dollars  at Time 0 . 
 Interest rate (i) is the discount rate . 
 Subscripts reflect the  time with the final time period being  T. 
We write the f ormu la in Equation 4. 
 
ܸܨଵ଴଴=ܸܲ଴(1+݅)்=$100 (1+0.05)ଵ଴଴=$13,150 .13    (4) 
 
You want  your money today  because one hundred years is very far away. Present value of 
$13,150.13 in one hundred years is worth $100 to today  because  you can take that $100 today, 
invest it in a savings account at  5% interest, and let it grow into $13,150.13.  If you receive a  
payment in the future, then we compute the  present value in  Equation 5 . 
 
ܸܲ଴=ி௏೅
(ଵା௜)೅=,ଵହ଴ .ଵଷ
(ଵା଴.଴ହ)భబబ=$100        (5) 
 
We use algebra to solve for unknown variables. For example, you have $1 0,000 to invest 
and want  the final balance  to grow into  $15,000 in four years. We can c alculate  the minimum 
interest you must ea rn to achie ve this go al. We show a ll steps of algebra in  Equation 6, and the 
minimum interest rate equals  10.66% annually.  
 
ܸܨ଴=்ܸܲ(1+݅)்          (6) 
$15,000 =$10,000 (1+݅)ସ

,଴଴଴=(1+݅)ସ  
√1.5ర=ඥ(1+݅)ସర  
1.1066 =1+݅  
݅=0.1066   
 
We have an easy formula to calculate  how long something  double s in size , known as the 
Rule of 72.  Interest rate, i,  as a percentage , and the time indicates  the number of years. 
Accordingly, the product of the interest ra te and time equals 72  in Equation 7.  
 
݅∙ݐ=ݐݓ݋ݎ݃ℎ∙݁݉݅ݐ= 72         (7) 
 
For example, if your bank deposit earns  4% interest per year, how long does your deposit  
double in size? Just  divide 72 by 4, and your bank account  double s in 18 years . What would 
happ en if your interest rate climbed  to 7% per year? Then your bank deposit would double  in 
10.3 years , or 72 ÷ 7. Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
77 
 Of course, we could solve for the interest rate using the Rule of 72. For example, which 
interest rate do you need  for your savings account to double in  5 years ? Your interest r ate must 
be 14.4% annually, or 72 ÷ 5 . 
We could apply the Rule of 72 to economic variables other than financial securities. For 
example, the Chinese  economy grows  10% per year. How many years does Chinese economy 
need to double in size? The Chinese  economy  double s every 7.2 years , or 72 ÷ 10 . On the other 
hand, the U.S. economy grows  slowly at 1% per year after the 2008 Financial Crisis.  How many 
years does the U.S. economy  double in size? The U.S . economy  double s in size every  72 years , 
or 72 ÷ 1 . What would happen  if the U.S. economy begins contracting in size by 1% per year? 
We cannot use the Rule of 72 for negative growth rates. It is impossible fo r something to double 
in size with  a negative growth  rate. 
Multiple Investments  
We can alter  the analysis, s o people  receive  or pay  multiple future payments.  For instance, 
you deposit $500 into the bank account every year at 6% interest.   
 
 After the first year, you earn $500 × 0.06  = $30 in interest . Your balance grows into $500 + 
$30 + $500 = $1,030  because  you have the initial  $500 , and then you deposit ed another 
$500 at the end of the year into your account.  
 After the second year, you earn $1,030  × 0.06  = $61.80  in interest . Your balance grows 
into $1,030 + $61.80 + $500 = $1,591.80.  You added another $500 to your account at the 
end of the year.  
 After the third year, you earn $1,591.80  × 0.06  = $95.508  in interest . Your balance 
becomes  $1,591.80 + $95.508 + $500 =  $2,187.31. You added the last $500, which did not 
earn interest.  
We calculate the future value of your bank deposits  in Equation 8 . 
 
ܸܨଷ=$500 (1+0.06)ଷ+$500 (1+0.06)ଶ+$500 (1+0.06)ଵ+$500 (1+0.06)଴   (8) 
ܸܨଷ=$2,187 .31  
 
Last term in Equation 8 is the final  deposit. Although you multiply this term  by an inter est 
rate, the exponent equals  zero setting the term inside the parenthesis  to a one. Consequently, the 
exponent indicates how many years of interest that specific $500 earned over the course of three 
years.  
We can re verse our logic and calculate the value of these cash flows  today  if you receive 
$500 now , $500 in one year, $500 in two years, and $500 in thr ee years.  We calculate the 
present value  of $1,836.51  in Equation 9 . 
 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
78 
 ܸܲ଴=(ଵା଴.଴଺)బ+(ଵା଴.଴଺)భ+(ଵା଴.଴଺)మ+(ଵା଴.଴଺)య=$1,836 .51    (9) 
 
If you r eceived $1,836.51  as a lump sum  today, you could  invest  this money  into a savings 
account and earn $2,187.31 in three years at 6% interest.  We converted a multiple stream 
investment into a single deposit investment.  
Present value formula is flexible  because  it can handle uneven withdrawals and 
investments.  For example, yo u do the following activities with  your bank account in Table 8.  
 
Table  8. Withdrawals and Deposits for a Bank Account  
Year  Activity  Amount  Interest + Balance  
0 Deposit  $100  $148.15  
1 Deposit  $300  $389.88  
2 Withdrawal  $50 -$57 
2 Deposit  $100  $114.00  
3 Withdrawal  $75 -$75 
  Total  $520.03  
 
Withdrawal or deposit  determines the sign . A withdrawal is negative, while a deposit is 
positive. Furthermore, the interest  plus balance column in Table 8  includes the interest rate that  
the deposit would earn if held it until the end of the third year. For example, you deposit ed $100 
into your  account  at Time 0  that grew into $148.15 in 3 years at 14% interest.  Moreover, you 
withdrew $50 in Time 2, which would earn $57 for the next two years . However, you withdrew 
it, making  it negative. Value of your withdrawals and deposits equals  $520.03 at the end of Year 
3. 
We use the present  value formula to calculate today’s value of  these cash flows . You would 
be indifferent about receiving a lump -sum payment of $351.01 today or $52 0.03 in three years. 
We calculated the present value  in Equation 10 . 
 
ܸܲ଴=(ଵା଴.ଵସ)బ+(ଵା଴.ଵସ)భ+ି
(ଵା଴.ଵସ)మ+ି
(ଵା଴.ଵସ)య=$351 .01    (10) 
 
If you invest ed $351.01 today  at 14% int erest, then in 3 years, you would  have $520.04 , the 
final balance of your bank account.   
Compounding Frequency  
Financial analysts always define an interest rate  as an annual term , called the Annual 
Percentage Rate (APR) . The APR come from  the Federal Reserve’s regulation that helps 
preven t fraud. For example, do you consider  a 1% interest rate a good interest rate to charge  a 
borrower?  Unfortunately, w e do not know the time period  this interest rate applies  to because  
the time period was omitted. If the 1% is annual, then it is a n excellen t interest rate for a loan.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
79 
 However, i f it is daily, subsequently, this rate is terrible . Borrower took  money from a loan 
shark.  For this book, we define all interest rates in annual terms, unless otherwise stated.  
Banks and finance companies usually calcu late interest  payments and deposits monthly.  
Thus, we adjust the present value formula  for different time units.  If you refer to Equation 11, 
we add a new variable, m , the compounding frequency  while APR is the interest rate in annual 
terms.  In the monthly case, m equal s 12 because  a year has 12 months.  
 
ܸܨ்=ܸܲ଴ቀ1+஺௉ோ
௠ቁ௠∙்
         (11) 
 
For example, you deposit $10 in your bank account for 20 years t hat earns 8% interest 
(APR),  compounded monthly.  Consequently, we calculate your savi ngs grow into $49.27 in 
Equation 12: If y our bank  compounded your account annually, then  you would  have $46.61.  
 
ܸܨ்=ܸܲ଴ቀ1+஺௉ோ
௠ቁ௠∙்
=$10ቀ1+଴.଴଼
ଵଶቁଵଶ∙ଶ଴
=$49.27    (12) 
 
Although the compounding fr equency is usually 12 months, we could use  semi -annually 
(two payments per year, or m equals 2) , or quarterly (four paym ents per year, or m equals 4).  
We can convert a ny compou nding frequency  into an APR equivalent interest rate , called the 
effective annual rate (EFF) . From the previous example,  we convert  the 8% APR interest rate, 
compounded monthly  into an annual ra te without compounding, yielding  8.3%. We show the 
calculation  in Equation 13. The EFF is the stan dard compounding formula removing  the years 
and the present value terms.

ଵଶቁଵଶ
−1=0.083     (13) 
 
If you deposited  $10 in your bank account for 20 years that earn 8.3% APR with no 
compounding  (or m equals 1) , then your savings would  grow into  $49.27, which is the identical 
to an interest r ate of 8% that is  compo unded monthly. We calculate this  in Equation 14.  
 
ܸܨ்=ܸܲ଴ቀ1+஺௉ோ

ଵቁଵ∙ଶ଴

We can adapt the p resent value formula  for frequency compounding. For example, what is 
the present  value if you receive $50 in a month, $100 in six months, and $75 in 13 months  at 
10% APR ? We must  adjust our time units to  months , which the smallest time unit . 
  
 We expressed the interest rate  in APR, so divide it by 12 to obtain the monthly interest 
rate, yielding  0.8333%  in our case . 
 All time subscripts are monthly.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

 We calculated a present value of $212.06  in Equation 15.  
 
ܸܲ଴=(ଵା଴.଴଴଼ଷଷഥ)భ+(ଵା଴.଴଴଼ଷଷഥ)ల+(ଵା଴.଴଴଼ଷଷഥ)భయ=$212 .06    (15) 
 
Compounding  frequency has a special case. As  m approaches infinity  (݉→∞), the 
compounding equation transfo rms into Equation 16 , called continuous compounding . 
Continuous compounding means for every fraction of a second; your balance earns interest. 
Abbrev iation, lim, refers to  the limit and defines  how the function behaves when m becomes 
very large. Thus, the number e is a constant and equals approximately 2.1828. Number e is 
similar to pi, and its digits do not repeat any pattern s.

For e xample, you deposit $50 in to your bank and leave it alone  for 70 years.  If the bank 
uses continuous compounding, then your savings grow into  $9,528.31 , calculated  in Equation 
17: Every fraction of a second over 70 years, you earn interest on your account. On t he other 
hand, if your bank uses  monthly compounding,  subsequently, your savings woul d grow into 
$9,373.90, yielding $154.41 less  than the standard compounding . 
 
ܸܨ்=ܸܲ଴∙݁஺௉ோ∙்=$50∙݁଴.଴଻ହ∙଻଴=$9,528 .31     (17) 
 
Banks and financial institutions rarely use continu ous compounding to calculate  market 
value s of financial securities. Financial analysts and mathematicians use continuous 
compounding to simplify complex calculations of financial formulas and mathematical models.  
Annuities and Mortgages  
Financial analysts use the  present value formul a to calculate an a nnuity . An annuity  is an  
investment for people who plan  for retirement. An annuity has t wo parts. As people work , they 
make periodic deposits into an annuity account. Subsequently, once they retire, they receive  
periodic  payment s until death.  
We define annuities  as an ordinary a nnuity  or an annuity due. If a person pays into an 
annuity at  the end of period , then it is an ordinary annuity . However, if a person pays into an 
annuity at the beginning of the period, he or she receives one extra payment that earns interest 
over the life of the annuity , called an annuity due . Consequently, they only differ when payment 
is applied to the annuity account and  when payments  begin  earning interest.  
For this chapter, we stick to ordinary annuit ies. For e xample , you invest in  an annuity  that 
earns 9% APR  interest  with annual compounding . Calculate  the value of your annuity in five 
years  if you pay $20,000 into the annuity.  We computed  the annuity growth as $119,694.21 in 
Equation 18.  
 Money, Banking, and International Finance

 ܸܨହ=$20,000(1+0.09)ସ+$20,000 (1+0.09)ଷ+⋯+$20,000 (1+0.09)଴ (18) 
ܸܨହ=$20,000 [1.09ସ+1.09ଷ+1.09ଶ+1.09ଵ+1.09଴]  
ܸܨହ=$119 ,694 .21  
 
Do you notice anything strange about the exponents? We raise the f irst term in Equation 18  
to the fourth power  because  your initial payment occurred at the end of period 1, and  has earned  
four years of interest. Finally, the last term has a zero exponent, and the final $20,000 does not 
earn interest. Moreover, mathematicians derived a formula to calculat e an annuity witho ut 
calculating  a long series of numbers. They derived a formula in  Equation 19, and c is the 
periodic payment into an annuity. Using the previous exam ple, the value of the annuity  still 
equals $119,694.21.

We also have the other side of an  ordinary  annuity. For e xample , you saved a $60,000 
annuity that earns 4% APR. You plan  to withdraw equal a nnual payments over 10 years. How 
much do you receive annual ly? Remember, you receive your first paymen t at the end of the first 
period, which is the beginning of the second period. That $60,000 earns interest for the first 
period. We compute an a nnual withdrawal  payment of $7,397.46  in Equation 20.

Financial analysts use t he pr esent value formula  to calculate mor tgage payments, which is 
vital to build ing an amortization t able. An amortization table  itemizes every payment f or a 
mortgage loan and  decomposes every  payment into interest and the amount that reduce s the 
principal. A mortgage is a bank loan for  a property, and the property becomes  the collateral. For 
instance, if a person has a mortgage for a house and defaults on the loan, the bank can legally 
take possession of the house. We u se the present value formula to build a n amor tization table.   
Mathematical notation for a mortgage is:  
 
 All future mortgage payments  (FV) are equal  and are usually monthly.  
 Interest rate  (i) is loan rate  and becomes  fixed throughout life of the loan.  
 Bank loan is amount recorded for PV 0 because t he bank loaned you money at time 0 . 
We show a mortgage as  a stream of cash flows to the bank  in Equation 21.

 All loan payments are equal , so we set  FV = FV 1 = FV 2 = FV 3 = ... = FV T. Thus, we can 
factor the FV terms from all interest terms  in Equation 22 .

For example, a bank granted a mortgage for $60,000 at an interest rate of 12% APR.  
Mortgage is  a six -year loan and paid annually . We s olve for FV  and calculate your annual 
payment of  $14,594 in Equation 24 .

We can use the mortgage loan information to build an amortization table.  We show a n 
amortiza tion table  in Table 9 . For Year 0 , you have $60,000 outstanding  because  you did not 
make a payment yet . Then you make your first payment in Year 1.  Your interest is 12%  
multiplied by $60,000, equaling  $7,200.  If your payment is $14,594 , then $7,200 is the interest  
while the remainder reduces the principal . Thus, you subtract $7,394 from the loan balance. For 
Year  2, and beyond, you repeat the sequence  until you pay the loan  in full in Year 6 .  
 
Table  9. An Amortization Table  
  Payment  Interest  Principal Paid  Loan Balance  
Year 0  - - - $60,000  
Year 1  $14,594  $7,200  $7,394  $52,606  
Year 2  $14,594  $6,313  $8,281  $44,325  
Year 3  $14,594  $5,319  $9,275  $35,050  
Year 4  $14,594  $4,206  $10,388  $24,662  
Year 5  $14,594  $2,959  $11,635  $13,027  
Year 6  $14,594  $1,563  $13,027  $0 
 
All amortization tables have one feature. First payment has the highest interest while  the 
lowest principal applied to  the loan balance . Then the interest amount declines over the life of 
the loan until it become s the smallest for the last payment.  
If a mortgage is monthly, then you divide the interest rate by 12 and multiply the number of 
years by 12.  For instance, a 20 -year mortgage will have 240 payments , 12 × 20. As you can see, Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
83 
 Equation 24 would have 240 terms. Consequently , mathematicians  devised a formula to 
calculate a mortgage with many payments . 
For example, compute  your monthly pa yment  if you bought a $150,000 home at 6 % APR 
with a  30-year mortgage.  We calculated y our monthly payment of $899.33  in Equation 25.  If 
you notice, Equation 25 is the same formula for an annuity payout with compounding frequency 
included. Interest rate, i,  is the APR interest rate divided by 12.

Amortization table can also handle balloon payments and variable interest rate mortgages.  
However, these topics go  beyond the textbook’s scope. A balloon payment is a person pays a 
low monthly payment every month. For the last payment, the person would pay the remaining 
balance, which  could be large. Moreover,  variable -interest rate loan is the bank can adjust the 
loan’s interest rate as marke t interest rates change.  
Foreign Investments  
We can use the net present value (NPV)  to calculate the monetary r eturn to an investment  
in Equation 26. This equation is almost identical to the present value formula, except the PV 0 is 
negative and located on  the right -hand side  while we add a new variable, NPV . If the net present 
value (NPV)  equals  zero, then th is equation reduces to  the present value formula. With the NPV  
formula, we could invest the amount  PV 0 today  that generates the future cash flows, FV i, that 
ends at Time T . Market interest rate is i, and it automatically compares out investment to the 
market interest rate.

If we calculate a positive, net present value , then our investment is  paying off. 
Consequently, the investment is increasing the investor’s wealth  because  more money flo ws in 
than out. Furthermore, investor s would use the net present value formula to evaluate several 
investment projects. The n they select  the project with the highest NPV , as long as the NPV is 
positive . An investor would never choose a project with a negative NPV  because  the proje ct’s 
return would be negative. Over time, m ore money flows out than in , creating a net loss .  
For example, y our brother wants you t o invest $10,000 into his business . He promise s to 
repay  you $12,000 in two years . If you invested your money into financi al securities, you 
believe you w ould earn an annual 10% APR. Is it profitable to invest in your brother’s business? 
We calculated a ne t present value of  -$82.64 in Equation 27. Unfortunately, you could earn 
more on the financial securities than your brother’s business  because  the NPV is negative.

 Investors can use the net present value formula  in Equation 28  to calculate the re turn of a 
foreign investment . We add a new v ariable, the exchange rate, Ei, to the formula . Exchange rate 
converts the value o f the foreign investment into the equivalent of  our home currency. 
Unfortunately, the e xchange rates change  continual ly, and we assume we know the exchange 
rate at every point in time . Subscript indicates the specific exchange rate for that year.

For e xample , you  invested 20,000 euros into Greece , and you expect to earn $8,000 each 
year f or Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3. Nevertheless, y ou could  invest  your money into your 
country’s financial mar kets that earn a 5% APR. Is your  investment  profitable? We forecasted  
the exchange rates below , and your home country is the United States : 
 
Time 0: Exchange rate  equals  $1.50 per 1 euro . 
Time 1: Excha nge rate equals  $1.75 per 1 euro.  
Time 2: Exchange rate equals  $2.00 per 1 euro.  
Time 3: Exchange rate equals  $2.10 per 1 euro.  
 
We calculate the n et pre sent value of your investment of  $12,358.27  in Equation 29. The 
NPV is positive, and the investment increases your wealth. However, we must forecast  the 
exchange rates, except today’s exchange rate, E 0. Exchange rates could fluctuate i n any

 7. Valuation of Stocks and Bonds  
This chapter provides an overview of stocks and bonds, and the methods financial analysts 
use to calculate the  market price using the present value formula.  Furthermore,  corporations 
issue a variety of bonds and stocks, and use them to expand business operations.  Corporations 
sell their bonds to investors  who buy these bonds and stock for investment.  They either hold the 
bond s until  maturity or sell the bonds  and stock  for a capital gain  or loss.  Consequently , 
investors must  know the difference between yield to maturity and the rate of return.  This chapter 
expands on Chapter 6, and we expand the p resent value formula  to value a variety of bonds and 
stocks .  
Overview of Bon ds 
Corporations often borrow money by issuing bonds.  A bond is similar to notes payable  
because  they are  written promise s to pay interest and principal . We show a  picture  of a bond  in 
Figure 1. Face value of this bond equals  $1,000 , and this bond matures on February 1, 2020.  
Consequently, w hoever holds this bond will receive $1,000 on this date , and the bondholder also 
earns  $100 ( 0.1 ×  $1,000) per year in interest.  Most bonds pay interest twice annually  or $50 
every six months for this example.

Figure  1. A picture of a bond  
 
Bonds , however,  differ  from notes payable.  A notes payable is a loan from a single creditor 
such as a bank , while a  bond is a loan that corporations issue in denominations of $1,000, 
$2,000, etc.  Finally, bonds are  standardized , and thus,  investors  can purchase them.  Moreover, 
investors can buy and sell these bonds on the financial markets before the bonds mature.   
Bonds differ  from corporate stock.  A share of stock represents ownership in a corporation.  
For instance , if a shareholder owns 1,000 shares out of 10,000, then he  or she  owns 10% of the 
corporation’s equity.  Moreover, t he shareholder also receives 10% of the corporation’s earnings, 
when the board of directors declares dividends.  On the other hand,  a bond represents a debt or a 
liability to the corporation.  For example, if a person owns a bond with a face value of $1,000 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
88 
 with an 11% coupon interest rate  and 20 -year maturity, then the bondholder has two legal rights.  
Bondholder has a  legal right to receive 11% or $110 interest each year  while  the bond is 
outstanding.  Furthermore, t he bondh older has  a legal right to receive  $1,000 when the bond 
matures in 20 years.  
A corporation needing  long-term funds may consider issuing additional shares of stock or 
issuing new bonds.  However, i f the corporation issues new stock, then  the existing  stockholders 
share control with new stock holders.  Consequently,  the stockholders lose part of control of the 
corporation.  On the other hand, the b ondholders do not share in the management or earnings of 
the corporation.  Although  the corporation must pay the bond interest, whether it earns profits  or 
losses , bonds reduce net income, thus lowering a corporation’s taxes.  U.S. corporations pay 
between 15 and  35% of their net income in taxes.  Nevertheless, bond interest payments are  an 
expense, which lowers the corporation’s net income.  If a corporatio n issues new bond s, then the 
common stockholders could  increase their dividend earnings.    
We show a n example of a cor poration expanding operations  in Table 1. This corporation 
had sold 300,000 shares of outstanding common stock  to investors , and it needs $2 million to 
expand its operations.  After the expansion, the management estimates the company can earn 
$1,000,000 annually.  Consequently, t he corporation has two plans.  For Plan A, the corporation 
issues 200,000 new shares of the corporation’s stoc k at $10 per share.  For Plan B, the 
corporation issues $2 million of bonds with a 10% interest rate.  Hence, th e interest expense 
equals  $200,000 per year.  
Examining  these two plans, P lan B result s in a greater  income per share  for the shareholders  
because  the bond’s interest lowered the tax burden by $60,000.  Thus, th e stockholders retained 
control of  the corporation, and they potentially  earn higher di vidends per share by using bond 
financing .

The Valuation of Bonds  
Governments and corporations issue a variety of bonds with different characteristics and 
cash flows. Consequently, we explain the main bonds,  and the methods investors and analysts 
use to value them. We show a discount bond  in Figure 2, and it is the simplest to calculate . This Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
89 
 discount bond is  a Treasury Bill  issued by  the U.S. government . For this example, t he Treasury 
Bill has a face value of $10,000, which we call T -bills for  short . Discount bonds do not have an 
interest rate listed on them . Thus, U.S. government sells T-bills at a disco unt or lower price. 
Lower price reflects the market interest rate.

Figure  2. A picture of a Treasury Bill  
 
For example, if the U.S. federal government sold this T -bill to you for $9,500, then the 
present value, PV 0, becomes the market price.  Subsequently, the federal government will repay 
you $10,000 for this instrument  on August 10, 2013 . The $500 difference reflects  the interest on 
this loan.   
Investors and analysts calculate the yield to maturity (Y TM), the return to an  investment. 
Yield to  maturity reflects an investor’s profit from a security that is similar to an interest rate. 
We state both i nterest rates and yield to maturity  in annual percentage terms. For our example, 
we calculated the yield to mat urity of  5.26% in Equation 1 if the bond’s face value equals  
$10,000  while  the market value is $9,5 00 with a maturity of one year.

         (1) 
 
If a discount bond has a maturity less than one year, then the time sub script remains  one 
year. However, we adjust the yield to maturity  to annual terms. For example, i f the T -bill in the 
previous examp le matured in 180 days, then we calculate it in  the same  way. Nevertheless,  we 
multiply the rate of return  by two  because  365 days divided by 180 is approximately two. In ou r 
case, the return would equal  10.52% .  
Discount bonds usually have a maturity of one year or less. However, we can adjust the 
prese nt value formula  to calculate bonds with longer maturities. For example, you purchased a Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
90 
 discount bond for $15,000 that has a face value of $20,000 with a three -year maturity. We 
calculate your annual rate of return of 10.1% in Equation 2. Did you notice the time subscri pt is

A coupon bond  differs from a discount bond  because  its interest rate  is stated on the 
certificate.  During the old days,  an investor would detach a coupon from the bond and mail it to 
the corporation or government for an interest payment . The n the corporation or government 
would  send a check to the bondholder.  We show a coupon bond  in Figure 3 with dated coupons 
at the bottom of the certificate .

Figure  3. An example of a coupon bond  
 
This coupon bond is a U.S. Treasury note with a face value of $20,000 , or T-note for short. 
Moreover, U.S. government pays 10% interest every six months; consequently, the person who 
possesses this instrument would  clip off one coupon and send it to the U.S. federal government 
for payment.  Hence,  the interest payment equals  0.1 × $20,000 ×  0.5 = $1,000  for every six 
months . When the T -note matur es on August 10, 2020, the bondholder receives  $20,000.  
Market interest rate rarely equals the bond’s stated interest rate.  If the market intere st rate is 
lower than the coupon  interest rate, the n a corporation or government would never sell the bond 
for the face value  because  it would pay a higher interest rate than the marker. However, the Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
91 
 government or corporation could sell the bond for a greater  market price , reducing  the investor’s 
return . Higher market price means the bond issuer  sold the bond  for a premium .  
A corporation , for example,  has a $1,000 bond that pays interest twice a year.  Interest  rate 
on the bond is 8%, equaling  $80 a year or $40 every six months.  If the bond matures in two 
years , then the present value formula has 4 periods .  
Market interest rate  currently is 4% a year, or 2% for a payment period . If the market 
interes t rate drops  to 4%, the corporation would not sell  this bond at face value  because  the 
corporation would pay a higher interest rate than the market . Consequently, t he corporation  can 
sell this bond for a greater  price, reflecting the market interest rate.  We calculate the b ond 
market pr ice in Equation 3, and it, PV0, equals  $1,076.15 . Therefore, a corporation pays 4% 
interest on bonds with an 8% interest  coupon  rate.

Market interest rate could swing in the opposite direction. Consequently, the c orporations 
and governments could sell bonds at a  discount  if the mar ket interest rate exceeds  the bond’s 
interest rate.  For example, a corporation sells a $1,000 bond that pays  8% interes t rate that pays  
twice a year.  Thus, the  corporation pays  $80 a year in interest, or $40 every six months.  
Furthermor e, the bond mature s in two years, or 4 periods in  the present value formula . If the 
market interest rate rises to  12% a year ( or 6% for a payment period) , an investor would never 
buy this bond at face value . They would earn  8% interest  year. However , the corporation could 
sell this bo nd for a lower price, compe nsating the investors for a great er market interest rate.  We 
calculate the bond market price  in Equation  4, and the bond’s market price , PV 0, equals  
$930.70 . Consequently, investors would earn a 12% return on their 8% interest bonds.

A government or corporation  could issue a bond that  never matures , which we call  a consul  
or perpetuity . Consequently, t he bond has no maturity date, but the bondholder receives inter est 
payments forever . A government or corpor ation rarely issues these  bond s because  most people 
and government li ke end dates for loans. However, this bond possesses  nice mathematical 
properties.  
A government , for example,  sold a consul that pays $50 interest per year , and t he bond 
never matures . If th e market interest rate equals  8%, then calculate  the market price, PV 0, of this  
consul.  Since al l interest payments are equal , subsequently, all future values, FV, are  the sam e in 
the present value formula. Thus, th e present value becomes an infinite series, which reduces to 
FV ÷  i. Consequently, we calculate the market price of this consul as $625  in Equation 5 . Kenneth R. Szulczyk

We list several b onds with dif ferent characteristics  below:  
 
 Registered B onds : Corporation registers the names and addresses of  the bondholders. Most 
corporations register bonds  because  the registration protects the investors  from loss or theft 
of the bonds.  
 Bearer Bonds : Who possesses t hese bonds receive the interest payment. Coupon bonds are 
usually bearer bonds.  
 Debenture  Bonds  are unsecured  bonds. Thus, t he corporation does not pledge assets for 
the bond issues.  A corporation must  be financially strong to issue these  bonds  because  
these bonds rely on the corporation’s  credit standing . 
 Convertible Bonds : Bondholder s have the  right to exchange the corporate bond s into 
corporate stock on a specified date.  
 Municipal Bonds : City and county governments issue municipal bonds to finance local 
projects . These bonds are popular with investors  because  the U.S. government does not tax 
their i nterest earnings . Consequently, municipal b onds usually  pay lower interest rates  than 
other bonds.  
Yield to Maturity and Rate of Return  
Investors who purchased a financial security know  the face value, the maturity date, number 
of interest payments per year, and the amount of interest payments.  However, investors do not 
know  the discount  rate. They can substitute the  information into the present val ue formula and 
solve for the discount rate.  Then i nvestors can calculate the discount rate for several different 
bonds and select the bond that has the highest discount rate.   
If investors hold the bond until maturity, then  we call  the discount rate  the yield to 
maturity.  Economists consider yield to maturity  the most accurate measure of the interest rates  
because  the yield to maturity allows investors to compare different bonds.  For example, you 
want to buy  a coupon bond today for a market price of $1,600.  Bond pays $400 interest per year  
and matures in three years.  Finally, the  bond pays $1,000 on the maturity date.  Consequently, 
we calculate your yield to maturity of 14.11%  in Equation 6 . You can compare this yield to 
other investments and choose the inve stment with the greatest yield.

As you can see, this calculation becomes  very complicated.  If you  calculate the discount 
rate manually, then you must  calculate the PV 0 by selecting various discount rates, such as 0%, 
5%, 10%, and 20%.  Next,  you insert your particular discount rate, r, into the Equation 7, and 
select the discount rate that has a present value, PV 0 close  to $1,600.  Mathematicians wrote  
programs that can s olve for the discount rate. If you visit the author’s website, www.ken -

Yield to maturity generates  two important rules  on bonds, which are :  
 
 Market interest rate (or  yield to maturity) and the market price ( or present value) of the 
securities are inversely related.  For example, if you examine the present value formula, the 
interes t rate, or yield to maturity is located in the denominators of the fractions. Thus,  the 
market pri ce falls as the interest rate rises, and vice versa .   
 If a bond has a shorter maturity, subsequently, its price will fluctuate less for a change in 
the market interest rate.  We show this by an example.  
For example , we have  two bonds with a face value of $5,000 and a coupon interest rate of 
10%, paid annually. In our case, both bonds pay $500 once a year. First bond matures in one 
year while the other bond matures in 10 years. If th e market interest rate rises  to 16%, then t he 
one-year bond has a market price of $4,741.38  while the 10 -year bond has a market value of 
$3,550. Consequently, the interest rate change affected the 10 -year bond more than the one -year 
bond. We calculated the market value of the one -year bond in Equat ion 8 and the ten -year bond  
in Equation 9. As this example illustrates, investors prefer money market securities  because  they 
fluctuate less  when the interest rate changes.

 You can  become  confused by the terms used  throughout  this book. We use y ield to 
maturity, discou nt rate, and interest rate  interchangeably, and you can interpret these terms to 
mean  an interest rate. However, a  rate of return  differs  because  investors could sell their 
securities before they mature d. Thus, the rate or return includes the interest rate and capital gains 
or losses.  A capital gain  is an investor sell s a financial security for greater  price, while a capital 
loss is an investor sells a financial security for a lower price.  Investors do not w ant capital 
losses, but they can  occur.  For instance, an investor must  sell an asset whose market price has 
dropped  because  he or she  need s cash quickly . Thus, th e present value still works for capital 
gains and losses.  Finally, if the investor holds onto the security onto the maturity d ate, then the 
rate of return equals the yield to maturity . 
A bond , for example,  has a face value of $2,000 with a coupon interest rate of 5%  and a 10-
year maturity.  You bought this bond for $ 2,000 and then resold it two years later for $2,400.  
Thus, you collected two years of interest.  Consequently, your rate of return equals the two years 
of interest plus the capital gain  of 14.33% . We calculated the capital gain in  Equation 10 , and r 
equals  the rate of return . The author  used a computer program to solve for r.

A capital loss is similar.  As an illustration,  you bought a financial security for $2,000 with a 
coupon interest rate of  5% and held it for two years. Although you earned two years of interest , 
this company reported financial trouble , and the bond price dropped to $1,000.  Unfortunately,  
we calculated  your return from  the investment  as a hug e loss of  -23.3%  in Equation 11 .

The Valuation of Stocks  
Value of a stock equ als the present value of an  asset's future cash flows.  Thus, the present 
value of all future cash flows is the asset’s market price  in Equation 12 . Market price of stock 
per shar e equals  P0. Market price in the time period 1 is  P1 while  D1 indicates the dividends.  
Finally, the rate of return is r, and t he subscripts indicate the time period.

95 
  
An investor values his stock, P 0, at time 0 that equals the discounted dividend he receives  
next year and the market price the investor receives  if he sells the stock . Furthermore, if the 
investor is in the first time period, then the  investor faces the same choice  for Period 2  in 
Equation 13 . Thus,  we moved the time subscripts  ahead by one period.

Then we build our  sequence by examining an investor’s decision for Period 3, and 
substitut e that equation into Equation 14  for variable P 2. We continue  to examine  an investor’s 
future decision fo r each time period until we derive  an infinite se quence in  Equation 15 .

If the corporation pays the same dividends , then  =D=D=D2 1 , subsequently, the 
market price becomes a perpetuity , where we simplify  a sto ck’s value to  Equation 16. 
 
rD=P0            (16) 
 
As an illustration , you purchase stock as a long -term investment.  Your annual rate of return 
is 5% , and you expect the corporation to pay $2 per share indefinitely.  Consequently,  you 
compute  the market value of this stock  of $40 per share in  Equation 17.

If you want  to know the market value of this stock for one year, then this becomes a trick 
question. Since you expect to earn the same dividend year after year, subsequently the market 
price is still $40.00. Thus, the in vestor does not experience any capital gains or losses.  
Many investors want  their dividends  to grow over time, and Equation 16  can include a 
dividend growth  rate. If the  dividend grows at g percent per year , then  we update  the present Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
96 
 value formula  to inc lude a dividend growth rate  in Equation 18. Consequently, we can simplify  
this infinite sequence into  something similar to a perpetuity.

For instance, you  purchase stock as a long -term investment.  Your rate of return equals  10%,

Equation 20 .

Two force s reduce future cash flows . First , a greater discount rate lowers  the fu ture value of 
cash flows . Second, a larger dividend growth rate increases the value of future cash flows, 
causing the dividends to grow faster than the rate of return. Nevertheless, th e dividend growth 
rate must  become lower than the discount rate, or g > r. Otherwise, the future cash flows become 
more valuable over time, making the present value negative.  
For example, you  purchase stock as a long -term investment. Your rate of return is 12%, and 
you expect the corporation to pay $5 at Time 1 with dividends growing at 5% per year. We 
calculated a market value of this stock of  $71.43 per share  in Equation 21 .

Some corporations, especially in  high-tech industries,  pay low dividends  in the beginning . 
Subsequently, the c orporation grows rapidly  over time , and it begins paying  higher dividends.  
We can modify the present value formula  to handle this situation.  Present value formula has two 
components:  
 
 Non-steady state – we use the present value to write out all cash flows , when  the dividend 
growth rate is not constant.  Non-steady state  occurs  for a new corporation . 
 Steady state – the corporation begins paying dividends  over time that  increase at a constant 
rate. This occurs after  the corporation becomes mature. Consequently, we calculate the 
cash flows  as a perpetuity.  
As an illustration , we set the rate of return to  10%.  A corporation pays a dividend of $6 at 
time 1.  Corporation expects to increase the dividend by  2% for the first y ear, 4% for the second 
year, and 6% for year 3.  After Year 3, the dividend  grow s at a constant rate of 6%  per year . In 
this case, we solve for the dollar value of the dividend for each year with no fixed  growth rate . 
We calculate  the following : 
 
 Year 1:   D1 = $6(1+0.02) = $6.12  
 Year 2:   D2 = $6.12(1+0.04) = $6.3648  
 Year 3:   D3 = $6.3648(1+0.06) = $6.746688  
Third year becomes the perpetuity  because  the corporation begins increasing the dividend at 
a constant rate . For this example, we must observe  the time subscripts.  Remember , we calculate  
the stock price, P,  one period before the dividend payment, D , in Equation 24.

 First, we set the dividends  to zero for the initial  three years, which means D1 = D 2 = D 3 = 0 
 Second, we set the dividend to  $10, for  the fourth time period, or D4 = $10. Next, we

 8. Determining the Market Interest Rates  
We explain  in this chapter which factors determine interest rates by using the market forces 
of supply and demand for bonds. Fu rthermore, several  factors  shift the supply a nd demand 
functions, which  alter the bond's market quantity, market price, and market interest r ate. These 
shifts allow analys ts and economists to predict  changes in the interest rates and bond prices. 
Moreover, we use dema nd and supply functions  to explain interest rate behavior during  business 
cycle s and recessions  and explain the Fisher Effect. Finally, we introduce a loa nable funds 
market  for a small country. Then  we expand  the supply and demand for bonds  to include a 
world’s real interest rate. Consequently, the world's interest rate either causes loanable funds to 
enter or leave a small country.  
The Supp ly and Demand  for Bonds  
Interest rates have fluctuated substantially in the United States during the second half of the 
20th century. For example, interest rates on 3 -month T -bills were 1% in the early 1950s. Then , 
the interest rates on T -bills soared to over 15% in 1981  and subsequently, plummeted to below 
6% in the mid -1980s and 1990s. Currently, T -bill rates have fallen below 1% after the 2008 
Financial Crisis.  
Everyone closely watches the interest rates . They determine whether consumers should save 
or buy, whether families should buy a house  or purchase bonds.  Furthermore, the i nterest rates 
influence  business decisions to invest in new equipment or invest their money into financial 
securities.  From Chapter 2, y ou have learned the major financial instruments.  All these  
instruments represent  credit market instruments.  All these instruments are loans, where one 
party lends funds to another party  except  corporate stock.  Stock conveys ownership in  a 
corporation and i s not a loan .  
Companies and governments  issue a variety of credit instrument  with different maturities . 
Therefore, each credit instrument has an interest rate associated with it. Financial markets have 
hundreds of financial instruments, which create hundr eds of interest rates. Good ne ws is all 
interest rates usually  move together. If one interest rate increases, then the other interest rates 
rise too.  For our analysis, we assume a market has one interest rate.  
Bond’s supply and demand determine the i nterest rate in the bond market , and a bond 
becomes  the tradable commodity . Investors buy bonds  while businesses and government supply 
bonds.  Consequently, the intersection of supply and demand functions in the bond market 
determines the bond’s market price and quantity .  
Demand function  reflects  the relationship between the quantity demanded and the market 
price of bonds, when we hold all o ther economic variables  constant. We show a demand 
function  in Figure 1. Demand function has a negative slo pe because  as you move from point A 
to point B, the price of bonds becomes lower, so investors  buy more bonds for a cheaper pr ice. 
Just imagine bonds are similar to a product . For example, if the price of a soda beco mes 
cheaper, then consumers  buy more sod as. Please note as you move from point A to point B, the Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
101 
 price of bonds decreases, so using the present value formula, th e market interest rate rises. 
Hence, the investors are attracted to the great er interest rate.  
 
 
Figure  1. Demand function for bonds  
 
Supply function  shows the relationship between the quantity supplied and the market price, 
when we hold all o ther economic variables  constant.  We drew a  suppl y function  in Figure 2. 
Supply function has a positive slope  because  as you move from point A to point B , the price 
becomes  higher  while  the market interest rate falls . Consequently,  businesses and firms  borrow 
more funds  because  the interest rates are cheaper.  Remember a bond’s interest rate  move s in the 
opposite directio n of a bond ’s price .

 Demand and supply functions intersect at one point,  the equilibrium . Equilibrium  reflects  a 
state of rest. As long as the supply or demand function does not change, then the price and 
quantity  remain where they are. We show s upply and demand functions  in Figure 3. At this 
point, the quantity demanded equals the quantity suppl ied for bonds. The Q* and P* represent  
equilibrium quantity and price. Using the present value formula, we can deduce what happens to 
the market interest rate.  
What would happen  to the bond market  if the bond’s price exceeds  the equilibrium price? 
Consequently, the quantity supplied is greater tha n quantity demanded, creating  a surplus . 
Businesses and govern ment  sell more bonds because the price of bonds is high, and interest 
rates are low. Howe ver, the investors do not  buy these bonds because the high price  and low 
interest rates . Thus, the bond’s price  falls until restoring equilibrium  at P* again.  
 
 
Figur e 3. Supply and demand for bonds  
 
What would happen  in the market  if the price of bonds were  lower than the equilibrium 
price? Quantity supplied becomes  less than quantity demanded, creating  a shortage . Bond prices 
are low , and interest rates are high. Con sequently, the investors have a large demand for bonds  
because the bonds make  a good investment. However, business es and government do not  sell 
bonds for a low price and high interest rate. Thus, the bond’s price must increase  until 
equilibrium is restored  at P* again, decreasing  the market interest rates . Therefore, the market 
always gravitates to  equilibrium and consistently eli minates shortages and surpluses  as long as a 
government does not interfere in the market.  
Demand function can shift  because  a factor has changed. Please know the difference 
between a movement along a demand curve and a demand function shift. We show a  decrea se in 
quantity demanded  in Figure 4. Investors demand more bonds as we move from point A to point 
B. Economists call this a cha nge in “ quantity demanded. ” Investors increase quantity demanded  
because  the price of bonds became cheaper. Consequently, a factor has changed the supply 
function  and not the demand function. If an outside factor affects  the demand function, then the

103 
 deman d function would shift. Economists call a  rightward shift  an “increase in demand ,” while 
a shift to the left is a “ decrease in demand. ” We show demand function shifts  in Figure 5.

Figure  5. A demand funct ion shifts  
 
We listed six factors  to show an increase in  the demand function,  shifting it  right ward . We 
show the i ncrease  in the demand function  in Figure 6. When the investors increase their demand 
for bonds, the d emand function shifts  right ward  because  investors buy more bonds. Thus,  both 
the equ ilibrium quantity, Q*, and bond’s market price, P*, rise . When we discount the bonds  
using the present value formula, the market inter est rate for the bonds fall .

Figure  6. A demand function  increases  
 
Listin g the s ix factors that increase the demand function:  
 
 An increase in wealth  increases  the bond’s demand function  shifting right ward . A growing 
economy creates  wealth . Thus, th e demand for bonds increases too  because  investors and 
the people have more wealt h and invest more in the bond market.  
 A decrease in the expected returns  on investment increases  the bond’s  demand  function 
shifting right ward . If investors believe the interest rates will be come lower, then investors 
would  buy more bonds  now. For example,  if you believe intere st rates will fall , 
subsequently,  the bond prices would increase.  Consequently, y ou buy bonds now  because  
you buy  bonds for a cheap price at a high interest rate  and could resell the bonds in the 
future for a greater price as market i nterest rate falls .  
 A decrease in expected inflation  increases  the bond’s demand function  shifting right ward . 
Inflation erodes the purchasing power of households, businesses, and governments.  
Inflation also erodes the value of investments, such as stocks and bonds.  Thus, the 
investors would buy fewer bonds  if they believe the inflation rate will rise in the future , 
especi ally long -term bonds.  If investors believe inflation would  decrease in the futu re, then 
investors buy more bonds  for investment . 
 A decrea se in the risk  of bonds increases  the bond’s demand function  shifting right ward . 
Investors loan  funds to borrowers, who will not default on their loans. Investors are usually 
risk averse. If investors believe the bond market becomes more stable and “safer, " then 
they buy more bonds.  
 An increase in the liquidity  of the bond market increases  the bond’s  demand function 
shifting right ward . Investors are attracted to highly liquid bonds . Future is uncertain , and 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
105 
 investors can sell an asset fast for little  transaction cost. If the bond market becomes more 
liquid, such as U.S. government sec urities, then investors boost  their demand for U.S. 
government bonds.  
 A decrease in information costs  increases the bond’s demand function shifting  right ward . 
Investors c ontinual ly need information, so they can evaluate their investments. For 
example, firms like Standard & Poor’s evaluate the financial strength of large corporations 
and the corporations’ ability to  repay their debts. Investors have low i nformation cost s for 
large corporations, increasing their demand f or large corporate bonds . 
Please note  the demand fun ction can shift  leftward  by the same six factors. You just  reverse 
the logic for the six factors. For example, an increase in expected inflation causes the d emand 
function to decrease and shift left ward . Conseq uently, the bond price fall s while  the interest rate 
rises. 
Four factors cause th e supply function to shift. We listed  them  in a way that causes the 
supply function to increase and shift right ward  in Fig ure 7. When businesses and governments 
issue more bonds, the s upply function shifts  right ward , causing the equilibrium quantity (Q*) to 
increase  while the bond’s market price (P*) falls. When we discount the bond’s price  using the 
present value formula, th en the bond's market interest rate rises.  
 
 
Figure  7. A supply function  increases  
 
Four factors shift  the supply function:  
 
 A rise in expected profits  increases  the bond’s supply function  shifting right ward . A 
business would borrow and boost its  debt to buy assets like machines and equipment  if the 
business expects larger  profits. Usually businesses issue bonds for machines and 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
106 
 equipment during a business cycle  because  of profit expectations , while the opposite 
occurs during a recession.  
 A decrea se in business taxes  increases  the bond’s supp ly function  shifting right ward . If a 
government subjects a business to high taxes, then the business  has a low incentive to 
invest in machines and equipment or expand its production.  More investment, such as 
borrowing funds  through the bond market, enlarges the firm , increasing its tax burden . If a 
government had lowered  the tax burden on businesses, subsequently, businesses  would  
invest more by using bonds, increasing the bond’s supply of bonds,  and the bond supply 
would shift right ward . 
 A rise in expected inflation  increases  the bond’s supply f unction  shifting right ward . 
Inflation erodes the value  of the dollar. C onsequently, the value of debt decreases over 
time. If businesses and g overnment believ e inflation would rise, they  borrow more funds 
by issuing bonds. Then, they  repay their loans with “cheaper” dollars.  
 A rise in government borrowing  increases  the bond’s supp ly function shifting right ward . 
When government spends more than what it collects in taxes, the government can borrow 
by issuing government bonds. The United States federal government operated with budget 
defic its for the last 40 years. Every  year, the U.S. government issues more debt via bonds, 
and the supply of bonds keeps increa sing,  which raises interest rates and reduces  bond 
prices.  
Please note the supply function can shift left ward  by the same four  factors. You ju st reverse 
the logic for the four  factors. For example, a drop  in expe cted inflation causes the supply  
function to decrease and shift left ward . Consequently, the bond price rises while the interest rate 
falls. 
Interest Rates and the Business Cycle  
Empirical evidence indicates th at market interest rates  rise during a business cycle and fall 
during recessions. During a business cycle, the amount of goods and services produced in the 
economy increases  because  businesses become  optimistic about future profits and invest in 
machines and equipment by issuing more bonds. Consequently, the bond's supply increases. 
Moreover, if an economy produces more goo ds and services, the economy creates  more wealth. 
Investors save more and invest in the financial markets. Thus, the bond's demand increases and 
the demand func tion s hifts right ward  in Figure 8.  
When both the supply and demand functions shift,  we know either the price or quantity 
while the other variable becomes indeterminate. In this case, both functions increase, causing 
the quantity of bonds to increase, but b ond prices and interest rates become  unknown. If you do 
not believe me, then experiment with the supply and demand functions. First, increase the 
demand function by a good deal, and increase the supply function by a little. Second, increase 
the demand func tion by a little and increase the supply function by much. Consequently, the Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
107 
 market price is greater  in the first case and lower in the second case. Therefore, changes in bond 
prices and interest rates become  ambiguous. Unf ortunately, we cannot prove inter est rates rise 
during economic expansions and fall  during recessions.  
 
 
Figure 8. Both supply and demand functions  increase  
 
The Fisher Effect  
We only discussed nominal interest rates. We did not adjust the n ominal  interest rates  for 
inflation. Unfortunat ely, inflation can have a significant influence on the financial markets. 
Investors and savers are concerned about the real interest rate  because the r eal interest rate 
reflects the true cost of borrowing. The Fisher Effect  relates nominal and real interes t rates  and 
we define the notation a s: 
 
 i is the nominal interest rate . 
 r equals  the real interest rate.  
 e is the expected inflation rate.  
We show t he Fisher Effect  Equation  in Equation 1.  It equals  a geometric average of the 
expected inflation rate and real interest rate.  
 
eπ+r+=+i 1 11          (1) 
 
For low  inflation and low interest rates, we can  use the  approximation  that we had  derived  
in Equation 2.  We set the c ross term er to zero  because  it becomes  a tiny number. However, if 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
108 
 the inflation rate or interest rate becomes hig h, the n the approximation loses accuracy  as the 
cross term becomes large.  
 

ee ee
π+rir r iπ+r+=+i
 111 1 1
         (2) 
 
For example, you expect the inflation rate will be zero ( e = 0 ), and you grant a loan for 
5% for one year. At the end of Year 1, you have 5% more money in real terms  because  you can 
purchase 5% more in goods and services. We calculated the real interest  rate in Equation 3.  
 
505 = πire          (3) 
 
What would happen  if you believe inflation will increase to 5% ( e = 5% ), and you grant a 
loan for one year at 5% ? At the end of year 1, you would  have 5% more mon ey, but prices, 
unfortunately, became 5% greater  too. Conseque ntly, your purchasing power would  not change 
in real terms. We calculated the real interest rate i n Equation 4.  
 
055 = πire          (4) 
 
Real interest rate, therefore, reflects the true cost of borrowing and becomes a better 
indicator of incentives to lend and borrow. Many financial analysts use nominal interest rates  
because  inflation is low in the United States, averaging 3% per year or less.  
We can use the bond market to show the Fisher Effect. If the inves tors and businesses 
expect higher inflation in the future,  then investors buy fewer bonds  while businesses  sell more 
bonds. I nvestors know the inflation would  erode the value from their investment  while 
businesses could repay the bonds with  inflated dollar s. Consequently, the demand for bonds 
shifts toward the left  while  the supply for b onds shifts  right ward . We show the i mpact on the 
bond market  in Figure 9. Accordingly, the price of bonds decreases and the interest rates 
increases. In this case, the amoun t of bonds (Q*) in th e market is ambiguous. You  prove this by 
shifting th e demand and supply curve  enough , so the quantity does not change. Then shift either 
function a little more and the equilibrium quantity changes direction . Thus, the greater 
inflation ary expecta tions cause greater bonds prices  and lower bond interest rates as we discount  
bond prices . 
Financial analysts always write i nterest rates for financia l instruments  in nominal terms.  If 
investors and the public have  higher expectations of inflati ons ( e ), then nominal  interest rates 
(i) become greater . If the government wants low nominal interest rates, then the public  and 
investors  must believe the inflation rate will be low.

Bond Prices in an Open Economy  
In the previous supply -demand graphs, the bond was the good for the market. However, we 
could switch the analysis , where the  money exchanged for the bond becomes  the commodity. 
Then money becomes  the loanable funds . Consequen tly, the bond and loanable funds mark ets 
yield  identical results because  we examine  the same picture in a different manner . Nevertheless, 
loanable funds switch the r oles of supply and demand. If  investor s buy bonds, then they have a 
demand for bonds . Inves tors become a source of loanable funds  because  they trade money for  
bond s. Thus, the investor s represent  the supply function in the loanable funds market. If a 
businesses or governments sell bonds, then they demand  loanable funds. Therefore, the y 
represent  the demand function for loanable funds. Equilibrium price in the loanable funds 
market is the interest rate  while  the equilibrium quantity is the amount of loanable funds.  
Previous supply -demand examples viewed  the bond market as a closed economy . A close d 
economy  has no financial tr ansactions with other countries  because  the country does not allow 
money and goods to flow across its borders . However, we could alter  the analysis to allow  
international investors in to the market.  An open economy  is a country allows goods, services, 
and financial securities to flow freely in or out of a country.  Consequently, the analysis uses the 
loanable funds approach.  Quantity represents  the amount of loanable funds  while  the price is the 
real interest rate.  We use the real  interest rate  because  investors are concerned about their 
investment return after accounting  for inflation. Thus, we deduct a coun try’s inflation rate  from 
the nominal interest rate, yielding the real interest rate.  
If a country were  a closed , small  econo my, the loanable funds market would be at 
equilibrium.  Domestic investors represent the supply of loanable funds  while  businesses and 
government s demand them. Furthermore, we assumed the country is  small  because  the 
investors, government, and businesses ca nnot influence the international interest rate. 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
110 
 Consequ ently, the real interest rate equals  5% in Figure 10  while  the amount  of funds in the 
market is  L*.  
If the world ’s real interest rate were  9%, then t he domestic investors would invest their 
funds in t he international market, earning a higher interest rate  in Figure 10 . However, 
businesses and government s would not  borrow funds at this interest rate  because  it is too high.  
Consequently, t he difference between quantity s upplied and quantity demanded reflects  the 
amount of fun ds leaving  the country at 9% real interest rate.  If this country were  a closed 
economy, subsequently, the market would have a surplu s, and market forces would lower the 
real interest rate  to 5%.   
 
 
Figure  10. Loanable funds in an  open economy  
 
If the world’s real interest rate were  1%, then firms and the government  would  borrow at 
the cheap rate s in Figure 10 . However, the dome stic investors would not  lend at that rate.  
Consequently, t he difference between quantity  demanded and qu antity supply reflects  the 
amount of fun ds enter ing the country.  If this country were  closed, then the loanable funds 
market would cause  a shortag e, and market forces would increase the real interest rate .  
We assumed the country is a small open economy  because  this country is too little to 
influence the world’s real interest rate. Many countries, such as the Netherlands and Belgium 
would fall within this category. However, a large country like the United States, Germany, or 
Japan  would affect the world’s real interest rate.

 9. Risk and Term Structure of Interest Rates  
Businesses and government s offer a variety of bonds  that differ in default risk, liquidity, 
information costs, and taxes.  Thus, these differences cause interest rates and bond prices to 
differ among these different securities.  Furthermore, the U.S. government offers Treasury Bills, 
Treasury Notes, and Treasury Bonds that range in maturity from 15 days to 30 years.  
Consequently, economists study these interest  rates  from these securities  that they call the term 
structure of interest rates.  Then e conomists can plot t he term structure,  called the yield curve.  
Yield curve usually slopes upward  and means the long -term U.S. government securities pay a 
higher interest rate than the short -term ones.  Economi sts use three theories to explain the 
characteristics of the yield curve and utilize the y ield curve to predict recessions . 
Default Risk and Bond Prices  
Default risk  is the possibility a borrower will not repay  the principal  and/or interest on a 
loan. For instance, the U.S. government has  little risk of default, and  investors call  U.S. 
securiti es default -risk-free instruments . U.S. government can raise taxes, print money,  or issue 
new debt, when it experiences  financial trouble.  On the other hand, a business has  some risk of 
default.  Business  can bankrupt and cannot  repay its debt.  Economists call the d ifference between 
the interest rate on the U.S. government bon ds and corporate bonds  the default risk premium . 
Investors add  default  risk premium to a risk -free investment , so they  can invest  in “risky” bond s 
because they earn a greater return . Risk premium is always positive.  Rating companies  such as 
Standard & Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor S ervice assess  the default risk for  
corporations.  These companies calculate a single statistic, called the bond rating , based on a 
corporation’s net  worth, cash flow, and ability to meet its debt obligations.   
Supply and demand functions that you  already  learned in the last chapter can help explain 
the impact of risk of a market. We draw the su pply and demand for two markets: government 
bond market an d corporate bond market . We set the same e quilibrium price and quantity for 
both markets in Figure 1, which means both markets have identical  risks. Unfortunately, a 
corporation could have financial tro uble, so investors believe the corporation could default. 
Some investo rs demand fewer corporate bonds  and invest more in government bonds. Thus, the 
dema nd for corporate bonds falls  while  the deman d for government bonds rise  because  the 
investors consider  the government bonds  default -free. 
Did you notice  the government bonds have a higher bond price  while  corporate bonds have 
a lower bond price?  Thus, the market interest rate always moves in the opposite direction of 
bond prices  because  of the present value formula.  Conse quently, corporations pay greater  
interest rates for their bonds  while  the U.S. government pays a lower interest rate.  Taking the 
difference between the government bond and corporate bond int erest rates , we can calculate  the 
risk premium.  As the default risk increases, then the risk premiu m increases too.  During 
recessions, wh en some businesses bankrupt, the default risk increases, increasing the risk 
premium. Hence, the difference between government and corpo rate interest rates would widen . Money, Banking, and International Finance

Liquidity and Bond Prices  
Liquidity causes  bond prices and interest rates to differ. For instance, U.S. government 
securities are widely traded and are the most liq uid. Hence, investors can  buy and sell them. On 
the other hand, corporate bonds are not as liquid and not as widely traded, so investors have 
more diff iculties in buying and selling them . Consequently,  we use a similar  analysis to default 
risk, which  we have  explained in the previ ous section. We start the analysis with the same 
liquidity in both the government bond and corporate bond markets  in Figure 2. Thus, both bond 
markets have the identical equilibrium bond price, P*, and hence, the exact liquidity.  
Then the secondary markets  expand  for government bonds boosting  the liquidity for these 
securities. Consequently, the investors are attracted to the government bonds  because  they are 
more liquid. D emand function increases  and shifts  right ward  for government bonds . However, 
investor s reduce their purchases  of corporate bonds  because  they are less liquid, decreasing  the 
demand function  and shifting it  leftward . Thus, the  government bond prices rise, which reduces  
the interest rate for government bonds. On the other hand, the corpora te bond prices decrease, 
raising  the market interest rate for corporate bond. Taking the d ifference between the two 
interest rates , we measure the degree of liquidity. Nevertheless, economists refer the difference 
in interest rates as a risk premium.

Information Costs and Bond Prices  
Information costs influence  the bond pri ces and interest rates. If investors need  time and 
money to acquire information on se curities, then they pay a greater information cost . We include 
these costs  in the bond’s market price and interest rate, and they raise the cost of borrowing. For 
example, investors know both U.S. government securities and corporate bonds from l arge 
corpor ations well,  and the securities  have the lowest informa tion costs . On the other hand, the 
information costs for new and small companies are high , and there fore, these companies pay 
greater  interest rates when they borrow funds.  
We can use the demand and supply analysis to create two markets for the high and low -
information -cost bond markets. Both markets start with the same level of information, an d 
consequently, the bond prices  and interest rates are identical. We depict the bond markets  in 
Figure 3.  The equilibrium bond prices are  identical for both markets and equal P* and the 
interest rates would be equal . 
Investors pay a greater cost to acquire  information for the high information cost bonds.  
Thus, investors are  attracted to the low -information cost b onds , boosting their demand  for low -
information cost bonds, increasing the market price  and decreasing market interest rate . High-
information cost bonds are not as attractive as an investment, so investors buy fewe r bonds, 
reducing  bond prices  and raising  interest rates . Therefore,  low-information -cost bonds pay  a 
lower interest rate.

Taxes and Bond Prices  
Taxes can cause bond prices and interest  rates to differ. For example, the U.S. government 
bonds have a lower risk of default and higher liquidity than municipal bonds, whereas 
municipal bonds  are the state and local government bonds. However, the interest rates of 
municipal bonds are consistent ly lower than U.S. government bonds for the last 50 years 
because investors do not pay U.S. taxes on the interest they earn on municipal bonds while they 
pay U.S. government taxes on U.S. government securities. If you bought municipal bonds, 
subsequently, you would earn a lower interest than U.S. government securities. Nevertheless, 
you pay no taxes, compensating you for the greater risk and lower liquidity.  
Demand and supply analysis  show s the impact of taxes on the bond markets  in Figure 4. 
Government taxes both the municipal and non -municipal bonds  while  the default risk, liquidity, 
and information costs are equivalent for both markets. Consequently, bond market prices have 
the same market  price, P*  and pay identical interest rates.  
U.S. Government has  exempt ed munic ipal bonds from federal taxes. Thus, investors are 
attracted to municipal bon ds, boosting their demand, increasing the market price and decreasing  
the market interest rate. On the other hand, the taxed bonds are not as attractive as an 
inves tment, so investors buy fewer bonds,  causing bond prices to fall and interest rates to rise . 
Therefore, municipal bo nds have a lower interest rate  than U.S. government bonds . 
Term Structure of Interest Rates  
Term structure of interest rates  is the interest  rates  differ by maturity  if the securities have 
identical risk, same liquidity, similar information costs, and the same taxes. Economists define 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
116 
 the t erm structure of i nterest rates  for U.S. securities  because  the U.S. government issues a 
variety of secur ities with maturities ranging from 15 days to 30 years. No other finance 
company or business issues a wide range of securities that differ by maturity than the U.S. 
government.  We show the in terest rates for U.S.  government securities  in Table 1 for three 
specific dates: July 28, 1999, July 31, 2000, and July 17, 2006. Year 1999 was a good year for 
the U.S. economy  as it grew fast with a low unemployment rate. Yield curve for years 2000 and 
2006 predict ed the  recessions in 2001 and 2007.

Economists plot U.S. government securities by the market interest rates and  maturity , which 
they call  a yield curve . Yield curve could display  a positive, negative, or flat slope  and has two 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
117 
 characteristics.  First, the yield curve usually slopes upward  because  the l ong-term securities  
have higher interest rates than short -term se curities . Consequently, T -bonds would usually have 
a greater interest rate than T -bills. Second, interest rates  move together, so the yield curve 
normally  shifts upward  or down ward as  the interest rate s change .  
Economists use three theories  to explain why  the yield curve has these two characteristics.  
Segmented markets theory  is supply and demand in each bond market determine the 
interest rate. For example, U.S. government securities are classified into specific and separate 
markets based on maturities. One group of investors  only invest s in T-bonds, while another 
group  invest s in T-bills. Consequently, the yield curve usually slopes upward  because  people 
prefer to hold short -term bonds rather than long -term bonds. Unfortunately, this theory  cannot 
explain why interest rates move together in different markets, shifting the yield curve. I f the 
markets of different maturities are separated and independent , a change in one bond market 
would no t affect another market.  
Expectations theory  states  investors view all securities with the same liquidity, risk, 
information costs, and taxes as perfect substitutes. Consequently, the intere st rate on a long -term 
bond must  equal the average of short -term interest rates that people expect to occur over the li fe 
of the security. For example, the current market int erest rate on a one -year bond equals  9%. You 
expe ct the interest rate to rise  to 11% next year, so when you buy another one -year bond for the 
following year, the average interest rate you expect to ear n is 11%. If you decide to hold a two -
year bond, the interest rate must be 10%  because  the interest rate will be 9% for the first year, 
and you believe interest rates will incr ease to 11% for the second year. After we average the  two 
years , your return wou ld equal  10%. If investors expect that short -term interest rates will rise , 
then the yield curve has a positive slope. If investors expect that short -term interest rates will 
drop, subsequently, the yield curve has a negative  slope. If investors expect  short-term interest 
rates will not  change, then the yield curve becomes  flat. Although expec tations theory explains 
why short -term and long -term interest rates move together, the theory cannot explain why the 
yield curve usually has a positive slope. This imp lies i nvestors would think short -term interest 
rates will increase  most of the time, but the short -term interest rate could fall or rise . 
Preferred habitat theory  is the most widely accepted  theory  and combines the expectations 
theory and segment markets t heory together.  Investors prefer to hold short -term bonds wi th a 
low, expected return  because investors prefer that type or  habitat . Money market securities 
fluctuate less than  capital market securities as  interest rate s change . However, the investors will  
invest in  long-term bonds if they earn  a term premium , a higher intere st rate . Conseque ntly, the 
yield curve slopes upward  because t he investors add the term premium  to long maturity bonds.   
Preferred habitat theory , furthermore, e xplain s why the long and  short -term interest rates 
move together . Intere st rate on a long -term bond  equal s the average of the short -term interest 
rates expected to occur over the life of the long -term bond . If investors expect  the short -term 
interest rates will increase, then the  yield curve has a positive slope.  If investors expect that 
short -term interest rates will de crease, subsequently,  the yield curve will  have  a negative slope.  
However, investors add a term premium , so the yield curve has  a positive slope  because  the term 
premium is high enough to cancel the effect of changing interest rates.   Kenneth R. Szulczyk

 Economists use the yield curve to predict  economic activity. When a yield curve i s 
downward sloping, such as  a three -month T -bill interest rate exceeds the 10-year T -bond, a 
recession usually occurs one year later. Investors become  pessimistic about the future  and reflect 
their pessimism  in the term structure of interest rates. We illustrate a  normal, upward -slopin g 
yield curve  in Figure 5 for July 28, 1999 , when t he U.S. economy grew f uriously with a low 
unemployment rate.  
Yield curve inverted before the recessions of 2007, 2000, 1991, and 1981  had started. For 
example,  the yield curve inverted on July 31, 2000, and the United States entered a recession in 
March 2001. Furthermore, the yield curve flipped upsid e down on July 17, 2006 and inverted 
several times through  the year. Subsequently, the U.S. economy entered the Great  Recession in 
December 2007, becoming the worst recession since the 1930s Great Depression  (Haubrich  and 
Millington  2014 ). Unfortunately, the w orld’s economy still feels the lingering effects of the 
Great Recession in 2014 .  
Although many economists and analyst use the yield curve to forecast recessions, the yield 
curve is not a perfect predictor. It predicte d two recessions in  1966 and 1998  that never occurred  
(Haubrich  and Millington  2014 ).

 10. The Banking Business  
We study the b usiness of banking by examining  a bank’s assets, liabilities, and capital.  
Then  we examine  several  bank scenarios  to show how  outside factors influence a  bank’s balance 
sheet . We record these changes  by using  a reduced balance sheet called T -accounts.  For 
example, we illustrate  how a bank could become inso lvent, while another scenario includes  the 
impact of interest -rate risk upon a bank’s balance sheet.  Then we discuss how banks use 
securitization to convert loans into marketable securities and how this le d to the 2008 Financial 
Crisis. Furthermore, students must understand Chapter  10 to understand  the next chapter  
because  Chapter 11  examines the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet , and the pub lic and banking 
system influence over  the money supply . 
A Bank’s Balance Sheet  
Checking and savings accounts are very popular in the United States. U.S. households 
invest nearly 1/4 of their wealth in banks. They make payment s by using  check s that transfer 
money from one bank and to  another bank. One reason behind the p opularity of bank accounts is 
the federal deposit insurance . If a bank bankrupts and customers cannot withdraw cash from 
their bank accounts, then the federal government will step in and pay the depositors their 
accounts. Deposit insurance guarantees each customer will not lose a maximum of  $250,000  if 
his or her bank fails . 
A balance sheet  is a financial statement that lists all the bank’s assets and liabilities.  Assets 
are things a bank owns, while liabilities are things a bank owes to other people.  Accou ntants list 
assets on the left and liabilities  on the right.  Subsequently,  accounting transact ions conform to 
the Equation 1. 
 
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Capit al      (1) 
 
Capital  equals  total assets minus total liabilities.  Capital has many names , such as net 
equity, net worth, or net assets.  If the business is a corporation, then we call this capital – 
stockholders’ equity.   
Liabilities  are the f irst item on a bank’s balance sheet . They  are the source of funds for a 
bank  with the m ost important being deposit  account s. Referring to Table 1, people and 
businesses held $8.1 trillion in deposits. Then checking accounts become one the most important 
deposit accounts. For example, if you needed money and went into a bank, the bank must allow 
you to wit hdraw money from your checking account immediately on demand. Con sequently, 
checking accounts become a liability to  the bank  because  the bank owes you this money. 
Moreover, checking accounts earn the lowest interest rate and are usually the cheapest source  of 
funds for a bank.  
Non-transaction deposits  are the second liability . These deposits include  the various types 
of savings accounts.  These accounts earn interest and do not allow check -writing  privileges.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
121 
 Consequently, these deposits require fewer  bank s ervices  and earn higher interest rates than 
checking accounts.  Non-transaction deposits include : 
 
 Savings account  is the most common and pays a higher interest than interest on checking 
accounts.  How ever, savings accounts have fewer  services than checking accounts.  
 Small -denomination time deposits  (Also called Certificates of Deposit) have maturities 
ranging from several months to over 5 years.  Although t hey are less liquid than a savings 
account,  they pay higher interest.  
 Large -denomination time deposits  are accounts that exceed $100,000.  Corporations and  
banks invest in these securities.  Investors can sell t hese time deposits in a secondary 
market before maturity.  Therefore, they are liquid and an alternative to T -bills.  As Table 1 
shows, investors held $702.8 billion in large time deposits in December 2013.

Commercial Banks in the United States (Weekly) - H.8. Available at

Borrowings  become the last liability . A bank borrows funds if the bank can lend the funds 
to a borrower for a higher inte rest rate than the interest rate paid on the borrowings.  Borrowings 
are not deposit accounts.  Banks can borrow from the Federal Reserve or from other banks.  We 
call a Federal Reserve l oan a discount loans . We show the banks’ borrowings in Table 1. U.S. 
banks borrowed $97.1 billion from U.S. bank s and $840.3 billion from others nonbanks.  
On the other side of a bank’s balance sheet, a bank has assets . Bank takes funds from 
depositors and loans these funds to borrowers who pay interest. Thus, banks earn i nterest  from 
the loans becoming a vital source of income for the bank. Reserves are  the first and most liquid Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
122 
 asset. They include  three items. First, a bank holds vault cash , which is simply cash the bank 
holds  in its safe. A bank has mo ney, so a bank can pay depositor s cash when they come to the 
bank to withdraw funds . According to Table 1, U.S. banks held $1.4 trillion in December 2013. 
Second, a  bank holds deposits at another bank  because  these deposits can aid in check clearing  
and in foreign exchange t ransactions. Finally, the bank holds deposits at the Federal Reserve. A 
central bank forces banks to hold a percentage of the bank’s checkable deposits, which are 
required reserves . The Federal Reserve wants to ensure that banks have enough reserves to me et 
depositors’ withdrawal s. 
Marketable securities  are the second asset.  Banks hold U.S. government securities, such as 
T-bills, T -notes, T -bonds, and municipal bonds.  (Banks can hold mortgage -backed securities, 
which we discuss under Securitization). Thes e securities are very liquid that we sometimes call  
secondary reserves.  If banks need cash reserve s fast, then the bank can  sell its marketable 
securities  quickly . U.S. banks held roughly $2.5 trillion in December 2013 as shown in Table 1.  
Loans are the thir d asset and the most important source of income.  In December 2013 , 
loans represented roughly 60% of total assets.  Unfortunately, loans have a greater  probability  of 
default than other assets,  lower liquidity, and more information costs.  However, banks are 
compensated for this risk by earning higher interest rates.  Loans earn higher interest r ates than 
marketable securities . According to Table 1, U.S. banks lent $1.3 trillion as commercial and 
industrial loans, $3.5 trillion for real estate, and $1.2 trillio n for consumer loans. Fifty -four 
percent of consumer loans comprise credit cards.  
Federal funds market  can be a bank asset or a liability . Each bank must hold reserves in the 
form of vault cash plus deposits at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve sets  the percentage 
of reserves a bank must hold because reserves help ensure banks have cash to meet depositors’ 
withdrawals. Federal funds market is one bank with excess reserves at the Fed can lend these 
reserves to another bank that is short in reserves. T hese loans are usually overnight, where banks 
transfer electronically the funds. Consequently, Federal Funds become an asset for the lending 
banks and a liability to the borrowing banks. Referring to Table 1, banks lent $81.8 billion to 
other banks in the Federal Funds in December 2013. Federal funds rate  reflects the interest rate 
for this market . 
Table 1 contains two items that are not self -explanatory. U.S. banks estimated $123.3 
billion in bad debt and losses during December 2013. We labeled this loss - Allowance for loan 
and lease losses . Furthermore, U.S. banks held 119.9  billion in trading as sets that banks use  in 
derivatives trading. Finally, the r emaining  bank’s assets earn no interest and include physical 
capital, such as the bank’s building s, comp uters, and other equipment , which totaled roughly $1 
trillion . 
Bank's net worth  or capital  becomes the last item on the bank’s balance sheet . Capital  
equals  total assets minus total liabilities. All banks organize themselves  into corporatio ns. A 
corporate bank’s capital  is the  stock sold to the investors plus the bank’s profit. Creditors 
consider capital important because it provides a financial cushion for loans and obligations. If a 
company bankrupts and cannot repay a loan, the creditors have the first priority of the 
company’s assets , while t he shareholders have the last priority. A positive capital ensures the 
bank can repay its loan obli gations. A  bank's net worth averaged  roughly 12.9 % in December Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
123 
 2013 . After the 2008 Financial Crisis, banks started accumulating more capital to deal with 
future financial crise s.  
A Bank Failure  
A bank failure  is a bank develops financial problems and fails.  Unfortunately, t he bank 
cannot return the depositors’ money . A government imposes regulations to encourage banks  to 
hold a large amount of reserves, marketable secur ities, and equity capital, reducing  a chance of 
bank failure . 
In this analysis,  we use T-accounts . A T-account  represents  a simpl ified balance sheet 
listing only changes for assets, liabilities, and net worth . For example, you open a checking 
account at your bank and deposit $100 cash.  We record the transaction below : 
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$100  Reserves  +$100  Checking account  
 
A central bank , for example,  requires commercial banks to hold 10% of deposits in the form 
of vault cash and/or reserves at the central bank.  Therefore, $10 of your checking ac count 
becomes required reserves  while  the remaining becomes  excess reserves . Banks can lend their 
excess res erves  to borrowers , and we record the transaction below:  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$10  Required reserves  
+ 90 Excess reserves  +$100  Checking account  
 
Bank earns no interest on reserves, so the bank grants a loan to a borrower  for $90.  Loan 
becomes  the bank’s source of income , and we record the transaction  below:  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$10  Required reserves  
+ 90 Loans  +$100  Checking account  
 
For the bank to earn a profit, the bank must  earn a higher interest  rate on the loan than the 
level of interest the bank pays  on your checking account.  If a borrower defaults and does not 
repay the loan , subsequently, t he bank must  return your $100 , when you demand it.  The bank 
would pay $90  from the bank’s net worth and $10 from required reserves.  
Banks face  another complication, liquidity risk  – the depositors withdraw more money from 
their accounts than the amount o f cash held in  a bank’s vault . Consequently, b anks d eveloped 
asset and liab ility management  to prevent liquidity risk.  Asset management  is banks lend to  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
124 
 borrowers, who will  pay high interest rates and are not likely to  default on their loans.  Then , 
banks purchase securities that have high returns, are  liquid, and have low  default  risk. If 
depositors begin withdrawing funds , the banks can sell the liquid securities  and pay  the 
depositors’ withdrawals . Liability management  is banks cannot force customers to open 
checking and savings accounts.  Thus, b anks are limited in these funding  sources. However, 
banks use  financial instruments , such as certificates of deposits, Eurodollars, federal funds 
market, and repurchase agreements.  Currently, banks have few restrictions  in raising funds.  
Illustrating  liquidity risk for your bank , we show your bank’s balance  sheet below.  The 
Federal Reserve requires your bank to hold 10% of deposits as required reserves.  Thus, your 
bank has  enough funds to meet depositors’ withdrawals.   
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required reserves        $10 million

Deposits               $100 million  
Bank Capital            10 million  
 
Depositors withdraw $10 million  that decreases deposits  by $1 0 million . Bank pays the  
funds from excess reserves, equaling  $10 million.  Consequently, t his bank has met withdrawal 
demands.  Both bank deposits and excess reserves decrease by $10 million , shown in the T -
account below : 
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required reserves      $10 million

125 
 Bank must  hold 10% of deposits as reserves , and t he bank must  find $8 million  for required 
reserves . Your b ank has the following options:  
 
 Bank could sell  $8 million of securities to raise funds.  
 Bank asks several borrowers to repay $8 million  in loans . Moreover, t he bank could sell  
loans to other banks.  
 Bank borrows the funds from the central bank or  from another commercial bank.  
Your bank borrow s the $8 million from the Federal Reserve as a loan.  Your bank managed 
the liquidity risk well.  We show y our bank’s balance sheet  below:  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required reserves      $8 million  
Excess reserves           0 million

Bank Capital            10 million  
 
Fed loan                      8 million  
 
How does a bank prevent a bank failure?  A bank holds excess reserves and short -term, 
highly liquid  securities to prevent a bank failure.  In the next example, y our bank has the 
following balance sheet below , and your bank will fail .  
 
Your Bank

Public circulates a rumor  the bank president lost millions in the derivatives market and had 
disappeared to the Bahamas.  Consequently , you and the other depositors are afraid  your bank 
will fail, so you and the depositors withdraw $20 million from your bank.  Your bank sells $10 
million in securities and uses $10 million in required res erves to meet dep ositors’ withdrawals, 
shown i n the T -account on the next page .

Now your bank needs $8 million in required reserves.  If your bank sold the  loans, the bank 
woul d sell the loans for a lower value  than the bank’s  book value.  Furthermore, t he other banks 
do not know your bank’s bor rowers, so these banks will  buy the loans for a  fraction of the loan’s 
value, generating  a substantial loss.  Your bank could ask other ba nks for a loa n, but other banks 
may decline if they believe  your bank will fail.  Your bank could ask the Federal Reserve for a 
loan, but the Fed may not grant the loan.   
Your bank  sells $40 million of loan s, but the other banks will  pay $25 million for the m. 
Now your bank became  insolv ent because  total liabilities exceed  total assets.  Unfortunately, 
your bank could fail . When a bank becomes insolvent, the U.S. federal government can legally 
take control of  the bank.  The bank  could have prevented its  failure  if the bank had more reserves 
or more highly liquid  securities.  We display y our insolven t bank’s balance sheet  below.  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required reserves          $25 million  
Loans                               50 million  Deposits                $80 million  
Bank Capital           10 million  
 
As you can see from the previous example, a bank could  fail if too many loans go bad.  A 
bank is  concerned about credit risk . Credit risk  is a risk that borrowers will default on their 
loans.  One metho d bank s use to lower credit risk is to  diversify their loan portfolios.  Banks 
spread their loans across  different industries, different regions, and different loan borrower s. For 
example, a bank grant s loans for credit cards, mortgages w here the homes are spread across  the 
state, and commercial loans  for hotels, restaurants, retail stores, and factories.  If a factory 
bankrupts and defaults on its commercial loan, the loan default does not harm the bank  severely  
because  the bank is earning income on the othe r loans.  
Adverse selection becomes  a problem for banks.  Some borrowers  apply for  bank  loans, 
when the borrowers know they will default . Banks impl ement six  procedures to reduce  adverse 
selection , which include : 
 
 Banks perform credit -risk analysis . Bank collects information about the borrowers’ 
employment, income, and net worth.  From this information, the bank assesses the 
borrowers’ ability to repay the ir loans.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
127 
  Bank prevents adverse selection by requiring collateral . Borrowers pledge assets to the 
bank.  If a borrower defaults on the loan, then the bank will seize the asset.  For example, 
the house becomes the collateral for a mortgage.  If the homeowner defaults on t he 
mortgage, then the bank takes possession of  the house.   
 Bank minimizes adverse sele ction by credit rationing . Banks establish a maximum amount 
of loan for a borrower.  For example, banks grant a maximum credit of $1,000 to college 
students . If a bank granted a credit limit of  $10,000, then some students  would borrow the 
full amount a nd cannot re pay the credit -card balance.   
 Banks use restrictive covenants  to minimize adverse selection.  Banks specify conditions or 
restrictive covenants  in the loan agreement  that prevent the borrowers  engaging in certain 
activities.  For example, a person applies f or a home -improvement loan  and plans to use the 
loan to speculate in the derivatives market.  Bank place  a restrictive covenant in the loan 
agreement.  Borrower can only use the loan for home improvement.  
 Banks may ask the borrower to have another r elative  having a good credit history  co-sign 
the loan. If the borrower defaults, then the bank can demand payment from the borrower or 
co-signer.  
 Banks mini mize adverse selection by fostering  a long -term relationship with the borrowers.  
When the banks know  their customers well, they can accurately assess the customers’ risk 
of default.  
The Interest Rate Risk  
Interest rates became volatile during the 1980s, forcing  banks to become more concerned 
with interest -rate risk. Banks experience an interest -rate risk , when changes in the interest rates 
cause t he banks’ profit to fluctuate. We show a n example of a bank’s balance s heet below:  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities   
Interest -rate sensitive assets:        $20 million  
 Variable -rate loans  
 Short -term securities  
Fixed -rate assets:                          $80 million  
 Long -term bonds  
 Long -term securities  Interest -rate sensitive liabilities:     $50 million  
 Certificates  of deposit  
 Money market deposit accounts  
Fixed -rate liabilities:                        $50 million  
 Checkable deposits  
 Savings accounts  
 
 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
128 
 Interest -rate sensitive items are short -term securities, variable interest -rate loans, and short -
term deposits. When the interest rate varies, these items change almost immediately. On the 
other hand, the fixed -rate a ssets and liabilities are not sensitive to interest rate changes. These 
loans and securities are locked into one interest rate for a long time period. Banks consider 
checking and  savings accounts  fixed -rate liabilities  because  these accounts pay little or no 
interest.  
If the interest r ate inc reases from 10% to 15%, which equals  a 5% interest increase, then the 
income from interest -rate sensitive assets  increases by $1 million (0.05 ×  $20 million = $1 
million). Moreover, the cos t of funds i ncreases by $2.5 million (0.05 ×  $50 million = $2.5 
million). Consequently, the bank’s profits decline by $1.5 million ($1 M - $2.5 M = -$1.5 
million). Unfortunately, changes in the i nterest rates impact  a bank’s profits  significantly . 
Three co nditions occur  as the  interest rate s fluctuate : 
  
 If the interest -rate sensitive liabilities exceed  the interest -rate se nsitive assets, then rising  
interest rates cause bank s’ profits to plummet, while falling interest rates cause bank s’ 
profits to increase.  
 If the interest -rate sensitive liabilities are less than  interest -rate sensitive asse ts, 
subsequently, increasing interest rates cause bank s’ profits to soar, while declining  interest 
rates cause bank s’ profits to plummet . 
 If the interest-rate sensitive liabilities equal  the interest -rate sensitive assets, t hen 
fluctuating  interest rates do not affect  bank profits.  
For examp le, if the bank manager knows  the interest -rate sensitive liabilities exceed the 
interest -rate sensitive assets, and he b elieves interest rates will fall , then he will do nothing. 
Bank manager expects the bank’s profit to rise . If a bank manager thinks  interest rates will 
increase, subseq uently, he would  boost interest -rate sensitive assets and decrease interest -rate 
sensitive liabilities by manipulating  balance sheet  items . 
During  the last 20 years, four factors changed how a bank manages its balance sheet. First, 
the U.S. federal government deregulat ed the fin ancial markets, granting banks  more flexibility 
in acquiring assets and liabilities. Second, financial innovation created new , liquid  financial 
instruments , such as repurchase agreements, federal funds market,  and securitization. Banks  
securitized their ba nk loans and transformed them into liquid securities. Third, the high volatility 
of interest rates during the 1980s contributed to the creation of new financial instrument, such as 
the floating -rate debt . Some banks grant  loans to borrowers with variable i nterest rates. If the 
interest rate ri ses, subsequently, the banks  increase the interest rate on the loans. For example, a  
variable in terest rate mortgage is  an adjustable -rate mortgage (ARM).  Finally, the derivatives 
market expanded during the 1980s. Bank s could buy futures and options to protect themselves 
from changing interest rates  and exchange rate . Therefore, banks learned to protect themselves 
from interest rate fluctuations.  Money, Banking, and International Finance

 Securitization  and the 2008 Financial Crisis  
Securitization  is similar to a mutual fund . We define securitization a s the p rocess of 
transforming  illiquid financial assets into marketable securities. Banks and financi al institutions 
package simila r loans  together , such a s mortgages, place them into a  fund, and issue  securities  
that are tied to the fun d’s assets. Then investors  buy the securities to earn the return on the 
fund’s assets . On average, the pool of funds  has a predictable cash flow as people pay their 
loans. Then investors receive these payments  as investment.  Banks used securitization  because  
they use computers to simplify  the record keep ing process . 
Securitization is more complex  because  a fun d could issue different  bonds called tranches. 
A tranche  is a French term meaning a portion or slice. Each tranche has a bond  associated with 
a risk level an d a different credit r ating . Credit -rating agencies co uld rate some bonds as AAA 
that pays the lowest return to investors, but investors are first in line  if the fund goes bust. 
Furthermore, t he fund issues risky bonds,  called speculative grade  that pay a higher return, but 
investors w ould lose their investment s if the fund bankrupts.  
Banks did not use s ecuritization on a  large scale before the 1990s  because  the banks could  
not price the different tranches in the fund until a statistician, David Li, devised a method in 
2000. Li’s method allows easy and quick pricing of these tranches. Consequently, the b ankers 
and financier s applie d securitization to a variety  of assets. They securitized mortgages, car 
loans, third world debt , credit cards, and student loans. Securitization of mortgages has its own 
named,  mortgage asset -back securities (ABS ). Unfortunately, the securitization of mortgages  
led to the U.S. housing bubble between 2000 and 2007.  Even in 2013, banks held $1.3 trill ion in 
asset -back securities.  
A problem of the U.S. housing bubble was the banks relaxed their loan requi rements. 
Before 2000, banks would grant home loans only to  borrowers with a stable work histor y and  
good credit history. Furthermore, the borrowers documented  their incomes  completely . During 
the housing bubble, several large U.S. banks relaxed their lending standards. Homebuyers could 
state their incomes without verifying them . Furthermore, b anks grant ed mortgages to people 
with poor credit or poor work history , called subprime loans . After  the U.S. economy had 
entered the 2007 Great Recessi on, the subprime loans turned into  toxic loans  as the subprime 
borrowers began  default ing on their loans in record  numbers.  
Banks relaxed their loan stan dards  because  they would not suffer from a mortgage default . 
Banks used securitization to “cash” out the mortgages and “push ed” the default risk onto the 
investors.  Cashing out of the mortgages gave ban ks funds to gra nt new mortgages  and continue 
the process.  Consequently, the banks rela xed their loan standards maintaining  a strong demand 
for mortgage loans. This credit flow  rapid ly appreciated  housing pr ices in the United States 
between  2000 and 2007.  If a borrower  had defau lted on the mortgage, homes kept  appreciating 
over time, so foreclo sures did not harm banks and  investors.  Banks and investo rs foreclosed on 
homes that soared  in value.    
Banks earn short -term profits from the mortgage closing cost fe es and managing  the fund.  
In addition , attorneys  earn legal fees from the fund’s setup . Of course, the banks do not earn the 
cash flow from a mortgag e because  the fund investors do.  For example, if a family bought a Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
130 
 $100,000 home at 7% interest rate, as a 30 -year mortgag e, then their monthly payment equals  
$665 per month.  This payment does not include property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and 
other fees.  However, the homeowner pays a total of $139,509 of interest to the investors’ fund 
over the life of the loan.   
Banks p ersuaded homeowners to accept adjustable -rate mortgages (ARMs).  Thus, a 
mortgage payment  change s as the interest rate  change s. At the beginning, homeowners paid low 
mortgage payments, but payments  would  explode in size as interest rates reset to higher lev els. 
Using the same example with a $100,000 mortgage with no principal paid, and the interest rate 
climbs to 10%, then the homeowner’s monthly payment climbs to $878 per month, increasing 
by $213.  Thus, they pay a total interest of $215,925 to the investor  fund.  With home prices in 
California averaging $500 ,000, these numbers become  extreme.  Some of the larges t players in 
securitization included  Countrywide Financial, Lehman Brothers, and Wells Fargo.  
Investment banks  profit ed from the U.S. housing market, contributing  to the housing 
bubble. Investment banks packaged the bonds from mortgage asset -backed securitized into 
Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) . They used re-securitization, where the investment 
bank s took securitized bonds and place d them into a fund, and issue d new securities that  they 
sold to investors.  The bankers created CDOs with  tranches to offer different returns and risk 
levels  to investors. Then the investment bankers sold CDOs to investors around the world , 
avoid ing U.S. reg ulations . Consequently, the investment banks earned fees from the fund’s 
setup and from the  fund’s  management . 
Credit-rating agencies, such as Standard &  Poor, and Moody’s conspired with the 
investment banks. Credit agencies always rated CDOs with an AAA c redit rating , even though 
some  CDO’s fund s contained subprime mortgages. Credit-rating agencies were either 
incompetent or perpetuating fraud. Many investors  and pension fund managers only invest in 
AAA rated securities. Without the AAA rating, the investm ent ba nkers co uld not sell the CDOs.  
For example, man y state governments require pension fund managers to invest in AAA rated 
investments. Thus, the Wall Street Bankers sold their CDOs to pensio n funds for police, 
teachers, and government workers. Furtherm ore, the CDOs were not transparent, and many 
investors did not understand how they worked. The AAA credit rating became  vital for bankers 
to sell  the CDOs.  
A company can  use a collatera lized debt obligation to enhance  their financial statements  
artificiall y. For example,  a company could package  their debt into CDOs. Subsequently, they 
became investors and pur chased the bonds  to this CDO fund, converting liabilities into assets. 
Financial analysts do not know how many companies used CDOs to improve  their fin ancial 
statements. The CDO market  ranged from $0.5 trillion to $2 trillion in 2006 . 
Mortgage asset -backed securities and collateralized debt obligations attracted large sums of 
money to U.S. housing market , causing the rapid  appreciation of housing prices. Commercial 
banks kept lowering their lending standards to grant more people mortgage s. Real estate agent s 
in Houston  repeated  a joke  – if you have a heartbeat and paycheck s tub in your pocket, then  a 
bank would grant you  a mo rtgage loan . Subsequently,  the 2007 Great Recession  struck the U.S. 
economy. Unemployment rate soared  to 10% , and h ouseholds, especially the subprime market, 
began defaulting  on their mortgages  in record numbers . Housin g construction industry had  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
131 
 collapsed , when homeowners stopped buying houses. Then the U.S. housing bubble deflated  as 
housing prices began  plummet ing. 
Surge in mortgage defaults caused t he investors  to question ABS and CDOs, and they  
stopped investing in securitized debt. Subsequently, both the commercial and investment banks 
became  stuck with billions in unsold CDOs . Furthermore , the banks and investors of CDOs and 
ABS foreclosed on homes that are losing value. Unfortunately, i f the banks accumulate too 
many bad mortgages, then they become i nsolvent.  Finally, the 2008 Financial Crisis c aused fear, 
panic, and paranoia  to sweep across t he financial world. B anks and financial institutions  had 
frozen all  credit and loans overnight.

 11. The Money Supply Process  
We examine  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  in this chapter  and explain  how 
fluctuations in the Fed’s assets and liabilities  affect the money supply. Money supply greatly 
influences the interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, and a country’s production of goods and 
services. Furthermore, fluctuations  in the money supply impact  the financial markets,  such as 
bond and stock prices  and the economic well -being of so ciety. Unfortunately, t he Fed can only 
influence the money supply  because  the public and banks also influence the money supply . For 
this chapter, we use the  definition s of money , M1 and M2, to explain h ow the banking system 
expands  the money supply by the multiple deposit expansi on. 
The Fed’s Balance Sheet  
Monetary base  equals  the currency in circulation plus reserves held by commercial banks.  
Currency in circulation  is the Federal Reserve Notes the public is holding, i.e. U.S. money, 
which does not include vault cash  at the banks  because we already counted the vault cash  as 
bank reserves. Moreover, t he Fed can directly influence the monetary base , and in turn, the 
monetary base influences the money supply.  Before u nderstand ing how the money supply 
process works, we introduce the Fed’s balance  sheet . Consequently, the currency in circulation  
and bank reserves  are liabilities to the Federal Reserve.  
Using a simple example , the Fed sets the  required reserve ratio  to 10% , which is  the 
percentage of total reserves that banks must hold as reserves at the Fed or as vault cash . If you 
open a bank account by depositing $1 00, then the bank must  hold 10% of  your deposit, which 
equals  $10. Thus, th e $10 is the required reserves . A bank could  hold more than $10 , which are  
excess reserves . Conse quently, t he bank holds reserves to meet depositors’ withdrawal s. You 
could return  to your bank and withdraw you r $100 deposit. Subsequently, the bank returns your 
money  from its reserves.  Bank either hold s $10 in its vault or deposit s the $10 with the Fed.  Did 
you notice  bank reserves are assets to the b ank, but liabilities to the Fed?  On the other hand, t he 
public holding money is an asset , but money is a liability to the Fed.  
The Fed has  two important  assets : government securities an d discount loans.  When the Fed 
increases its asse ts, the monetary base rises  When the Fed decreases its ass ets, the monetary 
base declines . The Fed can change the monetary base  through open -market operations . An open-
market operation  is the Fed buying and selling financial securities.  Usually the Fed buys and 
sells U.S. government securities.  When the Fed buys U. S. government securities, we call it  an 
open -market purchase  because  the Fed’s assets increase, expanding  the monetary b ase. The Fed 
can sell U.S. government securities , called an open -market sale . The Fed’s assets decrease, 
contracting the monetary base . For example, the Fed buys a $10,000 T -bill from your bank.  We 
list the transaction  on the next page in the T -account : 
 
 
 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
134 
  
Your Bank  
Assets Liabilities  
-$10,000 T -bill 
+$10,000 Deposit at the Fed   
 
The Fed  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$10,000 T -bill +$10,000 Bank reserves  
 
The Fed buys the T -bill by using a Fed check.  When the bank sends the check to the Fed, 
the Fed increases the reserves at your bank.  A Fed check is not backed by money per se . As the 
Fed clears its own check, it  adds numbers to  a bank’s accounting books.  Afterwards, t he bank’s 
reserves increase a nd your bank can lend to someone, so the bank  earns interest.  Consequently, 
the F ed’s assets increa se while both  the monetary base and money supply expand . 
For the second example, the Fed buys one T -bill from you for $10,000, using a Fed check.  
Subsequently, y ou deposit the Fed check at your local bank , and your net assets did not change. 
Bank’s reserves increase by $10,000, as well as the demand deposit.  Finally, the Fed’s T -
account becomes  identical to the last example.  
 
You 
Assets  Liabilities  
 -$10,000  Treasury Bill  
 +$10,000  Demand Deposit (Checking)   
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$10,000  Fed Reserve Deposit  +$10,000  Demand Deposit  
 
The Fed  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$10,000 T -bill +$10,000 Bank reserves  
 
Money supply has risen  because  you traded the T -bill for a demand deposit.  It mak es no 
difference if the Fed purchased  U.S. securities from the public or a bank.  Consequently, t he 
Fed’s assets increase, expanding  the monetary base.  Your bank’s reserves increase , and your 
bank can lend  to earn interest.  Then the money supply increases.  If the Fed  sells U.S. 
government securities, subsequently, the  opposite occurs.  
The Fed loans are the  second most important asset . The Fed  lends to banks, helping  the 
banks survive liquidity problems.  The Fed loans are called discount loans . Furthermore, we call 
the interest rate the Fed charges  for these loans  the discount rate . The Fed does not use loans to 
influence the monetary base.  Instead , the Fed relies on open -market operations  because  the Fed Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
135 
 has complete control over how many  securities , it buys and sell s. With disc ount loans, the banks 
determine whether  they wa nt to borrow from the Fed . The Fed cannot force a bank to accept a 
loan.  However, if the Fed makes more discount loans,  subsequently,  the Fed’s assets in crease, 
expanding  both the monetary b ase and money suppl y. For example, a bank asks the Fed for a 
loan of $1 million.  
 
The Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Reserves at Fed          +$1 million  Loan from Fed       +$1 million  
 
The Fed  
Assets  Liabilities  
Loan to institution    + $1 million  Bank reserves        +$1 million  
 
Bank’s reserves increased by $1 million, and the bank c an grant  more loans,  expand ing the 
money supply. When the bank repays the Fed loan, subsequently, the Fed’s assets become 
smaller. Furthermore, both the monetary base and the money supply decrease. We show the 
transaction  below in the T -accounts:  
 
The Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Reserves at Fed        -$1 million  Loan from Fed          -$1 million  
 
The Fed  
Assets  Liabilities  
Loan to institution    -$1 million  Bank deposit at Fed    -$1 million  
 
 
Multiple  Deposit Expansion and Contraction  
Banking  system creates the money supply through multiple deposit expansion . This means 
if the Fed increases the monetary base by $1, then the amount of checkable deposits in the 
banking system will increase by more than $ 1. Checkable deposits are a  component of the M1 
definition of money, consequently,  the money supply increases by more than $1.  We show the 
multiple deposit expansion by  using an example.   
The Fed eral Reserve  increase s the money supply, so the Fed buys a $1 0,000 U.S. T -bill 
from you.  You take the Fed check and deposit the whole $10,000 at your bank into your 
checking  account . We record the transaction  in the T -account on the next page.

 Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required Reserves         $1,000  
Excess Reserves              9,000  Deposits            $10,000  
 
Money supply immediately expands  by $10,000.  Bank must  hold 10% of its deposits as 
required reserves.  Thus, th e bank holds $1,000 of reserves against your account as a deposit at 
the Fed or as vault c ash. However, the bank has $9,000 in excess reserves.  These reserves earn 
no interest, and consequently,  the bank loans them out.  For instance, your bank grant s a $9,000 
car loan to your friend.  We display the transaction  below:  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required Reserves      $1,000  
Excess Reserves                   0 
 
Loans                            9,000  Deposits            $10,000  
 
Bank sends your friend a check  for $9,000.  Your friend takes this check to a car dealership 
and buys a car.  Car dealer deposits this check at his bank , and we record this transaction  below:  
 
The Car Dealer’s Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required Reserves         $900  
Excess Reserves           8,100   
 
Loans                                  0 Deposits               $9,000  
 
Did you notice the change in the money supply?  Money supply expanded  by $19,000  
because  you have $10,000 sitting in your account , and the car dealership has $9,000 in his  
account.  Car dealer’s bank must  hold 10% of the deposit, equaling  $900.  Remaining fun ds, 
$8,100, earn no  interest. Consequently,  the car dealer’s bank  lends this out.  Car dealer’s bank 
grants  $8,100 business loan.  We record this  transaction  below:  
 
The Car Dealer’s Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required Reserves         $900  
Excess Reserves                  0

137 
 Small business contracts with a cons truction company to renovate his  business.  
Construction company receives a check for $8,100 and deposits this check in its bank.  We 
record the transaction  below:  
 
Construction Company’s Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required Reserves          $810  
Excess Reserves            7,290  
 
Loans                                    0 Deposits                      $8,100  
 
Constructi on company’s bank must  hold 10% of this deposit, equaling  $810.  Remaining 
reserves, $7,290, earn no interest, and consequently,  this bank grant s a loan.  Did you notice the 
change in the money supply?  Money supply  has expanded by  $27,100, which includes the 
$10,000 in your accou nt, $9,000 in the car dealer’s account, and $8,100 in the construction 
company’s account.  When the construction company’s bank grants a loan, th en the money 
supply would increase again, and  multiple deposit expansion  occur s infinitely . 
We can derive the ma ximum change in the money supply when the monetary base changes.  
First, we start with the formula for total reserves  in Equation 1. 
 
Total Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves     (1) 
 
In this case, excess reserves equal zero  because  banks earn no  interest.  Banks grant loans 
using  their excess reserves . Second equation calculates  required reserves.  When a bank accepts a 
new checking account, the bank must  hold a percent age of the deposit , which is Equation 2. 
 
Required Reserves = Deposits × Required Reserve Ratio (r r)    (2) 
 
We s ubstitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 and set the excess reserves equal to zero, which 
yields Equation 3. 
 
Total Reserves = Deposits × r r        (3) 
 
Did you notice  the money supply changes when the Federal Reserve changes the bank 
reserves ? We show reserve changes in Equation 4 and deposit changes in  Equation 5. The Δ 
symbo l means change , and we take the difference between two  adjacent  time periods.  First time 
period is t, while  the future time period  is t+1.  
 
∆Rese rves = Total Reserves t+1 – Total Reserves t     (4) 
 
∆Deposits = Deposits t+1 – Deposits t       (5) 
 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
138 
 If we write  Equation 3 for two adjacent time periods: t and t+1.  Equations become  Total 
Reserves t+1 = Deposits t+1 × rr and Total Reserves t = Deposits t × rr. Then we  subtract the equation 
for the time period t+1 from the equation for the time period t, yielding Equation 6. 
 
∆Reserves = ∆Deposits × r r         (6) 
 
We solve  Equation 6 for change in deposits, yielding  the money suppl y equation in 
Equation 7. 
  
rrΔ= Δ1Reserves Deposits         (7) 
 
If the Fed eral Reserve  increases the monetary  base by  buying $10,000 of T -bills, 
subsequently,  the bank reserves increase by $10,000.  If the required reserve ratio equals  10%, 
then we substitute this into E quation  7. Consequently,  checkable deposits would  rise by  
$100,000.  We call this formula  the simple deposit multiplier , which equals ( 1 ÷  rr ). Simple 
deposit multiplier shows the maximum increase of the money supply for a change in bank 
reserves.   
Simple deposit m ultiplier assumes the banks lend  all their excess reserves. Banks continue 
to lend until the Fed’s entire increase in reserves becomes required reserves held by the banking 
system. If the required reserve ratio equaled zero, then a one-dollar  increase in re serves would 
expand the money supply infinite ly because  the banks do not hold any reserves.  
Leakages cause the money multiplier to be  smaller in the real world. Some people withdraw 
cash, when they  deposit  checks a t the bank while some banks do  not lend al l their exces s 
reserves . For example , banks refused to grant loans during financial panics, such as the 2008 
Financial Crisis. Inste ad, banks  invest ed in safe investments, like U.S. government securities. 
Some economists argue the Federal Reserve could inj ect trillions of dollars into the banking 
system without creating inflation by purchasing bad loans and government debt. However, these 
economists are wrong. If banks held onto the entire excess reserves , the money multiplier would 
equal one. Thus, if the Fed increased the monetary base by $1 trillion, then it expands the money 
supply by $1 trillion as it buys assets from the public. A rapid, expanding money supply creates 
inflation. If the banks lent their excess reserves, then the money supply would incre ase more 
than $1 trillion, creating greater inflation.  
The Fed  decrease d the monetary base by selling its assets, contracting both bank reserves 
and the money supply . We call the Fed  selling securities  the multiple deposit contraction . 
Transaction is  simil ar to multip le deposit expansion, except the numbers become  negative.   
Consequently , the Fed ca n control the monetary base  easily  but has less control over the 
money supply.  For instance, people can change their behavior that largely  impact s bank 
reserves.  For example, you went to your bank to withdraw $200.  We record the t ransaction  in 
the T -account  on the next page : 
 
 Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
139 
  
 
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
Required Reserves         $1,000 –  200 
Excess Reserves                                0 
 
Loan                                           9,000  Deposits             $10,000  – 200 
 
Bank pays  your $200 from  required reserves.  Bank does not have any excess reserves  
because  it loaned the excess reserves out.  Consequently, y our deposit becomes  $9,800 , and the 
bank must  hold $980 in required reserves.  However, it only has $800, so the bank is short $180.  
Bank calls in loans , causing  other banks to lose deposits.  Thus,  the money supply contracts by 
Equation 8. 
 
1,8000.1011801Reserves Deposits $= $=rΔ= Δ
r      (8) 
 
We do not i nclude your $200  because  you converted $200 from a checkable deposit into 
currency.  Remember the M1 definition  of money, as defined by  Equation 9. We start at  the $180  
because  you switched the first $200  from a checkable deposit into currency , and unfortun ately, 
we cannot count the same money twice . 
 
M1 = checka ble deposits + currency        (9) 
 
The Money Supply Multipliers  
People , who  hold more currency and fewer deposits , can cause bank reserves to fall , 
contracting the money supply.  Thus , the public determines the level  currency to hold relative to 
the bank deposits.  Economists examine the proportion of cash (C) to checkable deposits (D) as 
the currency -deposit ratio  (C/D).  Consequently, four factors  influence this ratio over time , 
which are:  
 
 Higher wealth causes the c urrency -deposit ratio to fall . When a country becom es wealthier, 
people have greater  income.  Thus, people would  deposit their money into banks  because  
holding large amounts of cur rency is risky .  
 Higher interest rates lower  the currency -deposit ratio.  Bank s pay interest rates  on deposits  
while currency does not.  When interest rates rise , people begin deposit ing money into 
banks to earn the greater  interest rate.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
140 
  Risk could raise  the cu rrency -deposit ratio . During a financial  panic, people  convert their 
deposits into currency , harming the economy . When depositors convert deposits into 
currency, bank s’ reserves decrease, shrinking  the money supply . Unfortunately, a  
contracting money supply could trigger  a recession.   
 Underground activities raise  the currency -deposit ratio.  People participate  in illegal  
activities do not want the government to know ab out them, so they  deal exclusively with 
currency.  Bank accounts leave transaction records.  Currency -deposit ratio would  increase  
if people evade d taxes or participate d in illegal activities.   
What  would  happen  if the Fed bought a T -bill from you for $10,000 ? Subsequently,  you 
take the Fed check to a bank and ask the bank to pay in cash.  In this case, the total bank reserves 
would  not change, but c urrency in circulation and monetary base rise by $10,000.  Effect of an 
open -market purchase on the monetary base is always the same, whether the  proceeds from the 
sale are  in deposits or currency.  When the Fed sells U.S. government securities, it decreases  the 
monetary base by the amount of government securities it has sold.  Consequently, t he Fed has 
complete  control over the monetary base.  
Money multiplier  equals  the ratio between  the money supply and the monetary base.  We 
define the notation a s: 
 
 We defin e the m oney supply  (M1)  as the currency in circulation (C) plus checkable 
deposits (D) , written as M1 = C + D.  
 Monetary base  (B) equals  bank s’ reserves (R) plus currency in circulation (C) , written as B 
= C + R.  
 Money multiplier  (m) equals  the ratio between the money supply (M1) and the monetary 
base (B)  or as  Bm=M1. 
We use  a clever substitution.  First, we start with the eq uation M1 = M1 and on the right -
hand side, multiply and divide by the monetary base , shown as Equation  10. The B’s would 
cancel , and M1 still equals M1.  
 
BBM1=M1 
          (10) 
 
Then  we substitute M1 = C + D and  B = C + R into the Equation 10 for the variables  within 
the brac kets,  yielding Equation 11.

Currency -deposit ratio equals  C / D w hile the reserves -deposit ratio is R / D. Both ratios are 
fixed.  
For example,  the currency in circulation equals $24 0 billion;  checkable deposits equal $600 
billion, and total bank reserves equal $60 billion. We  substitute these numbers into the currency -
deposit ratio and total reserves -depos it ratio  in Equations 13 and 14.

Money multiplier equals 2.8.  Although the money multiplier relates the t otal monetary base 
to the  money supply, the money multiplier also works for changes in the monetary base. For 
example, i f the Fed buys $100,000 in T -bills, then the monetar y base increases by $100,000, 
expanding the M1 money supply by $280,000.  The multiplier assumes the banks lend  their 
entire excess reserves.   
Banks can weaken the ratio between the monetary base and money supply.  For example, if 
the Fed increased the monetary base by buying $100,000  in T-bills and the banks  hold the entire 
excess reserves, subsequently, the money supply expands  only by $100,000.  Banks do not  lend 
any reserves, causing the  money suppl y multiplier to equal  one. We can prove t his because R = 
D.  
We derive the m oney supply m ultiplier for M2  similarly . The M2 definition includes time 
deposits , denoted by T.  We define the M2 definition  as M2 = C + D + T.  
Similar ly to the M1, we start with Equation 16. Monetary base (B) would cancel , leaving 
M2 = M2.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

We add a new variable - the time deposit to the checkable deposit ratio.  Public determin es 
this ratio by depositing their funds between  time deposits, checkable deposits, and currency.  
For example, t he currency in circula tion equals $240 billion;  checka ble deposits equal $600 
billion;  total bank reserves equal $60 billion, and total time d eposits equal $800 billion. 
Subsequently, we calculate  the ratios for currency -deposit, reserves -deposit, and time -
checkable -depos it in Equations 19, 20, and 21.

 The M2 money  multipl ier exceeds  the M1  always . Furthermore,  we can derive  the mo ney 
multipliers for M3 and L similarly . Of course,  these multipliers would be  larger than M2 and 
M1. Consequently, economists can measure the sophistication of a country’s financial system by 
comparing  the money definitions and their money multipliers.  If a country’s money multipliers 
are close together, then this  country small,  undeveloped  financial markets.  If these m ultipliers 
diverge greatly, subsequently,  this country possesses  sophisticated financial markets.   
Fed has  problems implementing monetary policy  if the money multipliers are unstable . 
Although t he Fed can control the monetary base precisely (B),  it only influence s the money 
supply.  The Fed  sets the required reserve ratio, but the public determines the currency -deposit 
ratio, and the banks decid e the level of excess reserves to hold.  Hence, we conclude the Fed 
cannot  control the money supply  precisely .

 12. The Fed’s Balance Sheet  
This chapter explains the items on the Federal Re serve’s balance sheet and uses  more T -
account transactions.  For instance, t he students learn how the Fed clears  a check between two 
banks.  Then we derive an equation that relates  changes in the Fed’s assets and lia bilities to  the 
monetary base and money supply. Then students learn whether  a government issues securities to 
cover a budget deficit impacts its central bank’s balance sheet, monetary base , and money 
supply. Finally, a central bank can intervene in its currency exchange markets to strengthen or 
weaken its currency.  
The Fed’s Balance Sheet  
Similar to  any corporation or business, the Federal Reser ve has a balance sheet. The Fed’ s 
assets are a nything of value  the Fed owns . Moreover, the Fed has liabilities, which are 
obligations and debt the  Fed owes to another party. After  we subtract the F ed’s total assets  from 
total liabilities, the remainder becomes  the Fed’s net worth. The Fed  publishes it s balance sheet 
in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, and the public has free access to it . The Federal Reserve 
Bulletin is a monthly publication of the Board of Governors that  includes money supply 
numbers, interest rates, and other economic data. Each Federal  Reserve’s asset, liability, and net 
worth are itemized  in Table 1 for September 26, 2012 : The w ord consolidated means all assets, 
liabilities, and capital  for all 12 Federal Reserve district banks  are added together . 
 
The Fed’s Assets:  
 
 Securities  are the largest holdings of the Fed’s assets, and they consist of U.S. government 
securities: T -bills, T -notes, and T -bonds. When the Fed uses open -market operations, it 
buys and sells securities. The Federal Reserve held $1.7 trillion in securities in 2012.  
 Mort gage -Backed Securities: The Federal Reserve purchased mortgage securities from the 
commercial banks and public corporations during the 2008 Financial Crisis. These 
mortgages are bad loans, where the borrowers defaulted. The Fed purchased $835 billion in 
mortgage -back securities, removing the bad loans from the banking industry.  
 Discount Loans  are Federal Reserve loans funds to banks, helping the banks overcome 
short -term liquidity problems. The Fed controls the interest rate on these loans, which 
influence the amount of loans that banks need. We call the interest rate the discount rate. 
The Fed loaned $1.7 billion to the commercial banks in 2012.  
 Items in the Process of Collection (CIPC)  are assets that arise from the Fed's check 
clearing process, and it equ aled $138 million in 2012. We show the check clearing process 
in this chapter.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

 Gold Certificates  are claims to gold held by the U.S. Treasury.  When the U. S. Treasury 
buys gold, it sells the  certificates to the Federal Reserve. In turn, the Fed credits the U.S. 
Treasury account at the Fed.  The Fed held  $11 bil lion in gold certificates in 2 012. 
 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issues Special 
Drawing Rights  that are credit securities . The IMF allocates SDRs to various countries 
around the world , and the Fed holds approximately $5.2 billion . We discuss SDRs  in 
Chapter 15 . 
 Coins: The U.S. Mint  designs and produces  all coins for the United States. The U.S. Mint 
is a department under the U.S. Treasury . Normally, the Federal Reserve prints the U.S. 
paper money , a Fed’ s liability. Nevertheless, the Fed  buys the  coins from the U.S. Mint, 
making  it an asset . The Fed had  $2.2 billion in coins  in 2012 . 
 Central Bank Liquidity Swaps  are Federal Reserve loans made to other countr y’s central 
banks  of developed countries . For example, the European Central Bank needs a loan from 
the Fed. The Fed can lend th e European Central Bank dollars  and can accept  euros as 
collateral. The Federal Reserve created the central bank liquidity swaps during the 2008 
Financial Crisis.  The Fed  granted $14.7 billion in central bank liquidity swaps in 2012.  
 Bank p remises  are the buildings and equipment owned by the Federal Re serve, which was  
$2.4 billion in 2012.  
 Other assets : The Fed owns other assets, including  foreign -exchange reserves, deposi ts 
and bonds denominated in foreign currencies. Moreover, the Federal Reserve created 
companies, such as Maiden Lane Transactions, to facilitate transactions with investment Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
147 
 banks and insurance companies during the 2008 Financial Cr isis. The Fed held  $202 
billion in 2012 for other assets  
The Fed’s Liabilities and Capital Accounts:  
 
 Federal Reserve notes  are U.S. paper money that t he Federal Reserve issues . Currency  
outstanding only includes cash held in bank vaults or  cash circulating within the economy . 
In 2012,  $1.1 trillion of U.S. currency circulated  outside the Federal Reserve.  
 Deposits by depository institutions : Banks hold reserves in  vault cash and deposits at the 
Fed. Deposits are assets to the financial  institutions, but liabilities to the Fed.  The Federal 
Reserve held  $1.5 trillion in bank deposits in 2012.  
 U.S. Treasury d eposits: The U.S. Treasury deposits its money into commercial banks that 
it collects from tax payments, fees, and U.S. government securities . When the U.S. 
Treasury pays expend itures, it transfers funds from its commercial bank accounts to its 
accounts at the Fed.  Then the Treasury Department writes checks on its Fed account.  
Consequently, the U.S. Treasury Deposits are an asset to the U.S. government, but a 
liability to the Fed eral Reserve.  The U.S. Treasury deposited  $65.7 billion at the Fed.  
 Foreign and other deposits : The Fed holds deposits from foreign governments, IMF, 
World Bank, United Nations, and U.S. government agencies such as FDIC.  The Fed held  
$24.2 billion in 2012.  
 Deferred  Availability Cash Items (DACI)  are liabilities that arise from the Fed’s role in 
the check -clearing process , which was $779 million in 2012 . We explain the c heck clearing 
process  in this chapter . 
 Other  liabilities  include  reverse repurchase agree ments and dividends the Fed owes to the 
national commercial banks. Other liabilities were  $101.4 billion in 2012.  
 Capital a ccount  equals  the Federal Reserves' total assets  minus  total liabilities.  This 
category wa s substantial and equaled  $54.7 billion in  2012 . The Federal Reserve is a public 
corporation and every U.S. commercial bank with a charter from the U.S. government must 
buy stock into its Federal Reserve district bank. Subsequently, t he Fed pays the 
commercial banks 6% annual dividend on their Fed  stock.  
The Check Clearing Process  
The Fed has the authority to clear checks, and the check clearing process can cause bank 
reserves and the money supply to fluctuate through the Federal Reserve float . The Federal 
Reserve float is the difference between cash items in the process of collection (CIPC)  and Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
148 
 deferred availability cash items (DACI) , and i t is always positive. As a float increases, it 
expands both the bank reserves and money supply .  
For example, you live in California, and you sent a $1,000 check  to a firm in New York 
City to buy a computer. Computer firm deposits the check in its bank account.  Subsequently, its 
bank sends  the check to the Fed  because  the Fed can clear the check between your bank and the 
computer firm's bank. Accordingly, the Fed credits the computer firm’s bank a $1,000 asset , the 
DACI. Next, the Fed must collect $1,000 from your bank , the CIPC. We record the c omputer 
firm’s bank a nd Fed’s T -accounts  below:  
 
The Computer Firm’s Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$1,000  DACI  +$1,000 Deposit s 
 
The Fed eral Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$1,000  CIPC  +$1,000 DACI  
 
Computer firm’s bank cannot touch the asset, DACI.  The Fed acknowledges the asset and  is 
in the process of collecting money for the computer firm’s bank.  After two days, the Fed 
converts the DACI into bank reserves.  Consequently,  the bank can lend  these reserves.  
 
The Fed eral Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities  
 –$1,000 DACI  
+$1,000 Reserves for computer firm’s bank  
 
The Computer Firm’s Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
–$1,000  DACI  
+$1,000 Reserves at the Fed   
 
If the Fed did not  collect  $1,000 from your bank with two days, subsequently, the Fed 
extends  credit to the computer firm’s bank.  Thus, t he total reserves of the banking sy stem 
increase  because  bank s did not lose  reserves.  That $1,000 check you wrote now exists as a 
$1,000 in your bank account and the computer firm’s bank account.  We calculated  the float 
from your check in Equation 1, and it equals  $1,000.  
 
Float = CIPC – DAC I = $1,000 - 0 = $1,000       (1) 
 
The Fed collects the $1,000 from your bank.  Accordingly, the float returns to zero, and your 
checking account decreases by $1,000.  Your check for $1,000 no longer exists in two places.  
Check clearing process is a long -drawn -out process  because  if you write a check for $100 and  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
149 
 have only $10 in your checking account, t hen this check does not clear.  That is why the Fed 
needs  permission to lower the bank’s reserves to clear the check; instead of automatically doing 
it. We display t he final transaction below:  
 
The Fed eral Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities  
– $1,000 CIPC  –$1,000 Reserves at your bank  
 
Your Bank  
Assets  Liabilities  
–$1,000 Reserves at the Fed  –$1,000 Your checking account  
 
Usually the float changes predictably during the mid -month  because  people pay their bills. 
Furthermore, the float changes in December  because  people write checks to buy Christmas 
presents or in April when people pay their taxes. Moreover, bad weather and transportation 
strikes can cause the float to soar expectantly as t he Fed experiences delays  in check collections. 
Consequently,  an increase in the float expands  both the bank reser ves and money supply . Then 
the Fed must nullify the float by selling U.S. government securities that reduce the money 
supply.  
Many banks join a clearinghouse  that can clear checks and wire transfers with out using  a 
central bank. For example, a large bank in New York is the clearinghouse  between two small 
banks. One bank is May Bank in Malaysia  while  the other is First National Ba nk in Indiana. 
Both banks have accounts at the clearinghouse . If a per son transfer s money from Malaysia to 
Indiana electronically, then the clearinghouse  reduces the account for  the Malaysian bank and 
adds the amount of the wire transfer to the Indiana's b ank. Consequently, banks and central 
banks clear checks and wire transfers similarly.  
Changes in the Monetary Base  
If the Fed’s balance sheet changes, subsequently, both the monetary base and money supply 
change . At first , this process seems complex , but economists use a trick . First, we list the Fed’s 
total assets in Equation 2 and to tal liabilities in Equation 3.  
 
Total Assets = U.S. gov. securities + discount loans + gold certificates + SDRs + CIPC  (2) 
 
Total Liabilities =  Currency outstanding (C) + depo sits by depository institutions (D) +  
 
U.S. Treasury deposits + Foreign and other deposits + DACI     (3) 
 
Next, we s ubstitute the monetary bas e formula into  Equation 3  because  the monetary base 
equals  deposits held by depository institutions plus currency  in circulation , or B = D + C. After  
subst ituting  the monetary base into E quation  3, we yield Equation 4.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
150 
  
Total Liabilities = Monetary base (B) + U.S. Treasury deposits + Foreign and other deposits +  
 
DACI + Capital           (4) 
 
Subsequently, we use  the accounting identity as defined by Equation 5 to relate the Fed’s  
assets, liabilities, and capital.  
 
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Capita l      (5) 
 
Finally, we s ubstitute  the total assets and total liabilities into the accounting identity , and we 
solve for the monetary base , which becomes Equation 6 : 
 
Monetary base (B)  =  U.S. gov. securities + discount loans + gold certificates + SDRs +  
 
( CIPC – DACI ) – U.S. Treasury deposits – Foreign and other deposits – Capital  (6) 
 
Equation  6 shows how a change  in the Fed’s balance sheet affects the monetary base.  For 
instance, if  the Fed purchases an asset, then the monetary base increases and expands  the bank 
reserves . When banks have more reserves, they grant  more loans, potentially increasing the 
money supply . Of course, the opposite could  occur.  If the Fed sells an asset, subsequently, both 
the monetary base and  bank reserves  drop, and money supply potentially  shrinks . Moreover, if  
the Fed ac quires a liabili ty in Equation 6 , then the  monetary base , bank reserves , and the money 
supply all fall . On the other hand, i f the Fed reduces a liability, subsequently, both the monetary 
base and bank reserves rise , and the money supply potentially increases.  
Consequently , many things  alter the Fed’s balance sheet.  Unfortunately, the Fed cannot 
control many items on its balance sheet. F or example, the Fed has no control over the Treasury 
deposits, the float (CIPC - DACI), gold certificates, SDRs, and foreign government dep osits.  As 
these items can change , the F ed must use open -market operations to  maintain a stable monetary 
base. 
Does U.S. Treasury Affect the Monetary Base?   
The U.S. federal government has experienced persistent budget deficits for the last 40 years  
because  the U.S. government spends more than what it collects in taxes . Government finance s 
budget deficit s in three ways. First, the U.S. government can decrease its spending, which is not 
politically popular. People demand benefits and social programs from thei r government. Second, 
the U.S. government can raise taxes, which could anger  the taxpayers . Finally, the U.S. can sell 
U.S. government securities. Thus, the U.S. government chose to finance budget deficits by 
selling more U.S. government securities.  
Could the U.S. federal government  affect the monetary base by financing  budget deficits? 
For example, the U.S. government increases taxes; you pay a total of $2,000 in taxes, and you Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
151 
 send the U.S. government a check for $2,000. We record t he T-account transactio ns below for 
you, your bank, the Fed, and the U.S. Treasury Department.

The U.S. Treasury Department  
Assets  Liabilities  
–$2,000 Taxes due  
+$2,000 Deposits at the Fed   
 
The U.S. Treasury , subsequently,  spends your $2,000 to buy more paper for a government 
agency.  A company receives $2,000 and  deposits the funds into t he company’s bank account. 
Although you paid higher taxes, the U.S. government returns your money  to the economy.  Thus, 
when a  government raises taxes and immediately spends it, the taxes have no impact on the 
monetary base and mo ney supply.  Nevertheless, the government does transfer funds from one 
party to another.  
For the next example, the U.S. Treasury finance s a budget deficit by selling T -bills.  You 
buy a $20,000 T -bill. We record t he T-account transactions  below for you, your  bank, the Fed, 
and U.S. Treasury.

The U.S. Treasury collects  your $20,000  and buys something with it.  When the Treasury 
pays for a product or service from the public, then the  U.S. government pays  $20,000 to a 
company , and the company deposit s the $20,000 into its bank account.  Consequently, t he U.S. 
government returns $20,000 to the economy , causing zero change s in bank reserves . Thus, w hen 
the U.S. Treasury issues new securi ties, the new securities do not affect  the monetary base and 
money supply.  
If the U.S. Treasury sold government secu rities directly to the Fed, subsequently,  the Fed is 
financing budget deficits , called monetizing the debt . Media refers this to printing mo ney. For 
example, the Fed directly buys $100,000 in T -bills from the U.S. government . Consequently, we 
show the impact on the Fed’s and U .S. Treasury T -accounts  below:  
 
The Fed eral Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$100,000 T -bills +$100,000 U.S. Treasury deposits  
 
The U.S. Treasury Department  
Assets  Liabilities  
 +$100,000 Deposits at the Fed  + $100,000 T -bills 
 
The Fed purchasing securities dire ctly from the U.S. Treasury do  not increase the monetary 
base as long as the money sits into the account.  However, once  the U .S. Treasury spends the 
money in  its account, then th e Fed’s assets increase, expanding  both the monetary  base and 
money su pply. 
The Fed eral Reserve  is not required to buy U.S. government securities  or help the U.S. 
Treasury finance budg et deficits.  The Fed and U.S. Treasury are independent.  However, the Fed 
can finance budget deficits indirectly.  For instance, if the Fed  stabilize s interes t rates, then the 
Fed could monetize  the debt  indirectly . For example, the U.S. Treasury issues new securities, 
decreasing  the securities’ market price  and raising  the interest rate . If the Fed maintains  the 
original interest rate, subsequently, the Fed must  buy the U.S. g overnment securities to return  
the interest rates  to the same level .  
Central banks  are not independent from their finance ministries  in developing countries . 
Unfortunately, t he finance ministry forces the  central bank to  finance budget deficits.  When a Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
153 
 central bank  monetize s the debt, it increase s in the mon ey supply, creating inflation.  
Consequently, many developing countries suffer from high inflation rates.  
A Central Bank Intervenes with its Currency Exchange Rate  
The United States financial system is linked to the international financial markets. 
Investor s, savers, households, businesses, and governments in foreign countries can influence 
the financial markets in the United States, while the U.S. financial markets similarly affect 
foreign financial markets. Consequently, governments intervene into the inte rnational markets to 
affect their financial markets.  
The Federal Reserve tries to manage the value of the U.S. dollar in the international 
markets. However, governments and central banks have difficulties in influencing the exchange 
rate of their currency  because  over $1 trillion in transactions occur daily in the foreign -exchange 
market. Foreign -exchange market is the largest international market in the world. As countries 
engage in international trade, goods move in one direction while money moves in the  opposite 
direction. When a central bank tries to control the foreign -exchange rate of its currency, 
economists call this foreign -exchange market intervention .  
The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury Department intervene in the foreign -exchange 
markets , man ipulating  the U.S. dollar exchange rate . Usually the Federal Reserve and Treasury 
coordinate their policies together. For example, the Federal Reserve holds foreign currencies, 
such as British pounds, European euros, and Japanese yen. Foreign currencies ar e an asset to the 
Federal Reserves, which are called international reserves . The Federal Reserve can sell or 
purchase U.S. dollars on the international markets that  impact  the U.S. exchange rate s and U.S. 
money supply. Table 2  summarizes  the impact of a strong or weak U.S. dollar on the U.S. 
economy .

The Fed believes the dollar is too weak and strengthens  the dollar . The Fed will sell foreign 
currencies and buy U.S. dollars. The Fed sells $10,000 in foreign currency, and we record  the 
transaction  in the T -account below . 
 
The Federal Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities

 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
154 
 This transaction removed $10,000 of U.S. currency out of the international market  because 
the Fed holds the U.S. dollars . Consequently, the monetar y base decreases by $10,000 while the 
money supply  contract s. Unfortunately, the Fed’s international reserves decli ne by $10,000. The 
Fed does not  buy U.S. curre ncy. Instead, the Fed could a ccept  a check for the foreign -currency 
sales. When the Fed cashes a check, the Fed decreases the bank reserves as it removes  money 
from the banking system. We record the transaction  below:  
 
The Federal Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities  
–$10,000 Foreign currencies  –$10,000 Bank reserves  
 
In this case, the monetary base  still decreases by $10,000 while  the money s upply  contracts . 
It make s no difference whether  the Fed eral Reserve  accepts a check or cash denomin ated in U.S. 
dollars. Both transactions impac t the monetary base  the same . If the Fed eral Reserve  believes  
the U.S. dollar is too strong, then the Fed can weake n or depreciate  the dollar by selling U.S. 
currency and buying foreign currencies. For example, the Fed b uys $30,000 of foreign currency. 
We record this transaction  in the T -account below.  
 
The Federal Reserve  
Assets  Liabilities  
+$30,000 Foreign currencies  +$30,000 Currency in circulation  
 
The Federal Reserve’s assets increase by $30,000, increas ing the monetary base  by $30,000 
and expanding the money supply . World’s economy has $30,000 more U.S. dollars in  
circulation. If the Fed let these foreign exchange transactions change the monetary base, then we 
call this  unsterilized foreign -exchange intervention .  
The Federal Reserve can prevent chan ges to the monetary base , when it influences  the U.S. 
dollar exchange rates , called sterilized foreign -exchange intervention . For example, the Fed 
believes the dollar is too strong and wants to weaken it. The Fed buys $30,000 in foreign 
currencies and sell s $30,000 i n U.S. currency, boosting the monetary base . However, the Fed 
performs an open -market operation by selling $30,000 in T -bills for cash. These two 
transactions cancel changes to the monetary base . Consequently, the change in the  Fed’s assets 
and liabilities are  zero, and we record the transaction  in the T -account below .

 13. The Central Banks of Europe and the United States  
We explain  the structure of the world’s two largest and most powerful central banks  in this 
chapter : The Federal Reserve System  (Fed)  and the European Central Bank  (ECB) . The Fed has 
an unusual structure because Congress and the President decentralized the power of its central 
bank, where  each central bank bran ch can tailor services f or its  unique region of the United 
States. Moreover, the Board of Governors  manages the Fed, while the Federal Open Market 
Committ ee handles the purchase and sale  of the U.S. government securities and other assets. 
Keep ing it straig ht, the Board of Governors  devises monetary policy, while the Open Market 
Committee puts monetary policy into action. Then we shift focus to the structure of the 
European Central Bank , whose structure mirrors the United States . The Executive Board devises  
monetary policy  while the Governing Council implements it. Finally, a central bank should 
remain independent of its government  because  a self -governing central bank can focus on price 
stability and low inflation . 
Why the U.S. Government Created Federal Res erve System  
The United States was a late comer to the world  when it created  its central bank.  The U.S. 
government permanently established a central bank in 1913 and named it the Federal Reserve 
System . Congress, government officials, and the public did not want to create a powerful 
financial institution, so the U.S. government created the Federal Reserve System to have many 
checks and balances. Most European countries formed  their central banks in the 17 , 18, and 19th 
centuries. They converted a large private bank into a central bank . For example, Great Britain 
established the Bank of England in 1694, and France founded the Bank of France in 1800.  
The Fe deral Reserve System comprises  of 12 Federal Reserve  banks.  The United States is 
decomposed into  12 regions , and each region has a Federal Reserve Bank  as shown in Figure 1. 
The Board of Governors  is located in Washington D.C. while the dots show the  headquarters for 
each Federal Reserve bank within its reg ion. The Fed is spread across  12 banks because  each 
section of the country is economically different.  For example, Michigan origi nally manufactured  
U.S. cars  while  Texas and Oklahoma supplied oil and natural gas.  Therefore, a Federal Reserve 
Bank can provi de services to its unique region.  Originally, each F ederal Reserve Bank provide d 
the following functions:  
 
 A Fed bank clears  check s for banks . 
 A Fed bank r egulates member commercial banks.  
 A Fed bank m anages the currency by issuing new currency and removin g old, worn -out 
currency.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
158 
  A Fed bank p revents financial panics by b eing a source of liquidity or emergency loans for 
banks during a n economic  crisis.  Each Fed B ank had the power to set the discount rate, or 
the interest rate on the loan.  
 A Fed bank c ollects and publishes data for the public.  Each Fed bank employs staff of 
economists, researchers, and PhDs, who conduct research for the public interest.  
  
Figure 1. The Map of the Federal Reserve B anks  
 
The President and Congress created the Federal Res erve System  to prevent financial panics, 
such as the Panic of 1907. The New York Stock Exchange plummeted nearly 50%  while  many 
banks teetered on bankruptcy  as people began bank runs. Consequently, a  Federal Reserve Bank 
is a “lender of the last resort.”  It provides emergency  loans to banks and helps restore 
confidence in the banking system . Moreover, the Fed loans were originally discount loans. For 
example, a ba nk needs $9,500, and  it asks the Fed for a loan. If the Fed agrees, the bank gives 
collateral t o the Fed, such as a $10,000  T-bill. Then the  Fed incre ases the bank’s reserves by 
$9,500, the loan . The d ifference between the loan and T -bill is  the discount, which  reflects the 
interest rate  the Fed charges for the loan.  Economists call this interest ra te the discount rate.  
Furthermore , the government did not create the Fed to alter the money supply, manipulate 
interest and currency exchange rates, or manipulate the financial markets to achieve economic 
goals.  Nevertheless, t he Fed learned to do this dur ing the 1920s.  
The Federal Reserve System ’s Structure  
Unique feature of a Federal Reserve Bank is each bank is a federally chartered corporation.  
Each bank has its own stockholders, directors, and a president.  Furthermore, e very national 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
159 
 commercial bank is  required  to purchase stock of the Federal Reserv e Bank in its district,  
equal ing to 6% of the commercial bank’s net equity (capital).  National commer cial banks are 
banks whose charter comes  from the U.S. government.  These national banks are also called 
member banks , and they  earn a fixed 6% dividend  on their shares of Federal Reserve stock . 
Each Federal Reserve Bank has nine directors.  Member commercia l banks elect six 
directors:  Three  directors are ban kers while the other three  are from business.  Board of  
Governors , which holds  the power at the Fed, appoints the last three  directors.  In turn, the nine 
directors elect the president of the Fed district bank.  Of course, this is not a free election  because  
the Board of Governors  must  approve the bank president .  
Commercial banks have no control over the ir Fed district  banks , although they privately 
own them . A Fed bank does  not operate like a corporation where the stockholders can freely 
elect the board of directors, who  vote on the major corporate policies.  Congress  created this odd 
structure because it  did not want the Fed to be part of government or controlled by the banks, 
but somewhere between  them . Nevertheless , the Fed is a part of government or quasi -
government.  When Congress created the Fed in 1913, it dispersed the Fed’s power  over the 12 
Fed B anks. Over time,  the Board of Governors consolidated the central bank’s power.  
Board of Governors  is the entity that controls the Federal Reserve System.  It determines 
monetary policy, reserve requirements, and discount policy.  Board consists of seven members, 
who serve a 14 -year term.  Most board members will not finish their term  because  they resign 
and work for the financial firms on Wall Street for five ti mes their Fed salary. A board member 
earns roughly $150,000 per year. A U.S. president with Senate approval appoints the members 
and appoints the chairperson and vice -chairperson of the board.  Chairperson and vice -
chairperson serve a four -year term.  The Co mptroller of the Currency and Secretary of the 
Treasury cannot be members of the board  because  the Federal Reserve must remain independent 
of the U.S. federal government. I f the U.S. government is accumulating  a massive debt , and the 
Treasury cannot  increa se taxes or borrow, then the Treasury could resort to print ing money  to 
cover deficits  by forcing the Fed to buy its securities . Unfortunately, printing money always  
leads to inflation.  
Board of Governors is independent of the U.S. federal gove rnment in th ree ways. First,  
Board of Governors earns its revenue from the 12 district  banks. The Fed does not ask Congress 
for money. Whoever controls the money is directly or indirectly in  command . Second, the terms 
of the board members are staggered. Every two years, the U.S. President appoints one me mber 
to the Board of Governors, or  14 years divided by seven members . This prevents a newly  
elected President from appointing  all members at once, who become loyal to the President. 
Third, the government ca nnot comp letely audit the Fed. Less government knows;  the less it can 
tamper with things.  Please do not think the Fed is entirely independent! If the Federal Reserve 
angers Congress too much, Congress could rewrite the laws that created the Fed.  
The Federal Open Ma rket Committee (FOMC)  is a special committee within the Fed that 
makes decisions about open -market operations. Although the Board of Governors determines 
monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee puts the policy into action. After the 
FOMC makes a  decision, the committee sends a directive  to the manager at the  New York City 
Federal Reserve B ank to buy and sell U.S. government securities.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
160 
 The FOMC consists of the  Board of Governors, plus five F ed district bank presidents. 
President of the Federal R eserve Bank of New York City is a permanent member of the FOMC 
and is always the FOMC  vice-chairperson because  New York City is the financial center of the 
United State s. The Fed buys and sells government securities through the New York Fed Bank. 
Remaining  four positions for the FOMC are rotated among the  other 11 F ed district bank 
presidents. Moreover, the Fed buys securities from the secondary markets. If the Fed bought 
securities directly from the prim ary market, then it would be buying directly from the  U.S. 
Treasury . Thus, the Fed would not be independent from U.S. Treasury if it buys new securities 
in the primary market.  
Chairperson of the Board of Governors  is also chairperson of the FOMC.  This person is a 
powerful man  because he or she c ould advise the President, informs Congress of the Fed’s 
actions, and is the spokesperson of the whole Federal Reserve System.  When he  or she  speaks, 
everyone in the financial world  listen s. Current  chairperson is Janet Yellen , and many consider 
her the second  most power person  in the United States after the U.S. P resident.  
The European Central Bank  
The European Union (EU) created a common market among European countries. Many 
countri es eliminated customs between EU countries as  they erected  comm on customs to t he 
outside world. Thus, capital, goods, labor, and services  can move anywhere within the EU  
freely . Furthermore, t he EU has improved efficiency in other areas . Many EU countries reduced 
or eliminated their purity and labeling laws that  stopped  import s from  other EU members . For 
example, the Greek government removed regulations for ice cream  while  Belgium removed its 
chocolate laws. Even Germany removed it s beer purit y law that was passed  in 1516. That l aw 
requi red all German beer producers must  make beer fr om only four ingredients: barley, hops, 
water, and yeast.  
The EU allows new countries to join, but they  must overcome many obst acles for 
member ship. Both Turkey and Croatia want to join the EU, despite the 2012 European Debt 
Crisis. EU membershi p requires  a member country  be a democracy, where the citizens elect the 
government officials. Furthermore,  governments must  respect human rights  and have a 
functioning market economy. As of 2012, the EU has 27 members.  
The European Union had created new institutions , such as the European Parliament and 
European Court of Justice. These i nstitutions are not concentrated in one cou ntry but spread  
across EU members . Most institutions are located in Bruss els, Luxembourg, and Strasbourg.  
One drawback to the European Union was the EU created new bureaucracies, as the top leve l of 
government. T he EU employed approximately 33,000 government officials and bureaucrats in 
2012.   
Seventeen EU members use the common currency, the e uro that we  refer  to as the 
Eurozone . The Eurozone  replicates the United States by forming the  world's largest market with 
a single  currency. As  a large number of countrie s share s one currency, it creates  four benefits. 
First, a single currency has no exchange rate risk. Citizens from different countries c an sell and 
buy goods with one another, and they do not worry about changes in the exchange  rate. Second, 
a single currency reduces the transaction costs  because  the parties do not convert  one currency Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
161 
 into another.  Third, a  single currency helps align  political interest s. The Eurozone  members 
work and cooperate with each other  as they strive for peace  and stability . Finally, a single 
currency promotes compe tition and regions within the Eurozone  begin to specialize.  
Specialization can occur across many industries  and countries . For instance, the financial 
institutions within the Eurozone can specialize  and reduce  their lending costs . Furthermore, 
countries can  specialize . Germany  specializ es in automobile and machinery production  while  
France specializes  in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and aerospac e. As countries within the 
Eurozone  specialize , the producers experience higher efficiency and greater produ ctivity , and 
they have access to more consumers . Consequently, the zone  helps integrate European countri es, 
spurring economic gro wth and unleashing  the competitive market forces. Over time, the 
Europeans should see their living standard rise and their unemployment rate  fall. 
The European Central Bank (ECB)  manages the euro and  is located in Frankfurt, 
German y. ECB  was modeled after the Bundesbank, which was Germany’s central bank . Primary  
goal of the ECB is to achieve price stability,  keep ing the e uro stable with  a low inflation rate . 
Euro i s successful while  the Eurozone rivals the Uni ted States in terms of GDP. Furthermore, 
the euro was appre ciating against the U.S. dollar as  it strove  to become the new internati onal 
currency because  Europe’s financial markets and int ernational trade rival the U.S.  
Euro did  well until the 2008 Financia l Crisis struck the world’s economy. Euro began 
losing  ground against the U.S. dollar. Subsequently, several EU member countries, such as 
Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain were plagued with severe budget problems that led to t he 
European Debt Crisis in 2012 . We discuss the crisis at the end of the  chapter.  
Structure of the European Central  Bank is  similar  to the structure of  the Federal Reserve 
System. The Governing Council  decides and formulates  monetary polic y for t he European 
Central Bank and  is simil ar to the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System. The 
council is c ompos ed of the Executive Board and 17  Governors . The Governors are the heads 
from their  country ’s central bank that are members of the Eurozone . 
The Executive Board  implements monetary policy  and manages the day -to-day operation 
of the ECB , similar to the Fede ral Open Market Committee (FOMC). Board has a preside nt, 
vice president, and four additional members , who m the  European Council selects . The 
European Council  consists of heads of state  of the EU member countries.  The Euro pean 
Counci l appoints members to the Exec utive Board  for an eight -year term that is not renewable . 
Furthermore, the board members ’ terms are st aggered. Consequently,  the European Council  
cannot c hange the board members all at once . President of the Executive Council also becomes  
the president of the Gover ning Council. The ECB  president is selected from a central bank 
whose country is a member of the Eurozone. Winn Duisenburg , from the Netherlands,  was the 
first ECB president . 
EU c ountries retained their centra l banks, even countries that  have  adopted the euro . 
Country’s central banks remain  independent  of the EU , and the top official of a cent ral bank in 
the Eurozone is a governor  and a member of the Governing Council. Currently, 17 EU countries 
adopted the euro, which means the Gov erning Council has 17 Governors.  Country’s government 
selects the gove rnor who serves at least a five -year term . Furthermore, the g overnors have more 
influence on moneta ry policy  within the European Central Bank  than the presidents of the Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
162 
 twelve Federal Reserve banks  have  over the Board of Governors . Consequently, Board of 
Governors centralizes the power within  the Fede ral Reserve  and controls it . 
All central banks of the  European Union buy stock into the European Central Bank, even 
countries that are not members of the Eurozone. Thus, the EU central banks own the  European 
Central Bank. S imilar ly, the national commercial banks  buy the Federal Reserves’ stock in its 
distric t within the United States. Amount of stock, a central bank buys, depends on a country’s 
population and GDP. Germany owned 18.9% of the ECB’s stock in 2011  while  France owned 
14.2%, and Great Britain had  14.5% . The ECB returns  80% of its profits to the sto ckholders, 
which are the central banks of member countries . 
The European Central Bank is the most independent central bank in the world. No EU 
country or EU institution can hold it accountable. Even the European Parliament, the highest 
representative body of the EU, cannot audit or dictate policy to the ECB. Moreover, the ECB 
does not receive funding from any EU body or government, and the terms are staggered for the 
Executive Board. Th us, th e European Council cannot manipulate the ECB by appointing the 
whole Executive Board at once. Consequently, the ECB concentrates on price stability, which 
they define as a 2% or less inflation rate per year. Other countries, such as the United States can 
pressure the  central bank to pursue several goals, such as  lowering the unemployment rate or 
manipulating  interest and currency exchange rates.  
The Eurozone created three  problems among  its EU members. First, the coun tries 
surrendered control of their  mone tary policy.  If a country experiences  financial problems, it 
cannot use its central bank to help finance the government ’s deficit . For instance, a  central bank 
could devalue  its currency to stimulate economic growth  because  a devalued currency boosts 
exports and reduces imports, creating jobs in the export indust ries. Second, prices soared in 
Southern Europe  while  wages fell behind, impoverishing many people. Fin ally, the ECB cannot 
legally  buy bonds from EU government s. However, the Europeans wer e worried about the 
Greek Debt C risis, and it bought Greek governmen t bonds to keep the Gree k government 
operating. We discuss t he Greek debt crisis  in the next section.  
Is the Federal Reserve Independent of the U.S. Government?  
Two viewpoints describe whether the Fed serve s the public interest or act s in its own self -
interest. Public interest view  states th e Fed serves the public  by implementing monetary policy 
that causes stable prices, low unemployment, and  strong  economic growth.  Many  economists 
argue  the Fed does not serve the public interest  because  it does not emphasize  price stability and 
economic growth.  Furthermore, many experts criticized t he Fed ’s role in the 2008 Financial 
Crisis.  Unfortunately, the Fed kept interest rates low artificially . Low interest rates encourage  
people a nd speculators t o buy houses, inflating  both the housing bubble  and housing prices .  
Principal -agent view  is government bureaucraci es do not serve the purpose the  political 
leaders created them for. Bureaucrats become  concerned about maximizing their power, 
influence, and  prestige. For example, a new  computer corporation is founded , and it creates new 
computers for a low price . If consumers  buy this  computer , then the corporation earns profits. 
However, if the corporation builds computers that nobody wants, subsequently, t he corporation 
will bankrupt. Profits ensure businesses will  produce goods and services that consumers want. Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
163 
 On the other hand, profits do not guide the government agencies, and n o mechanism keeps a 
government agency in check. Every year, government agenci es receive more funding, regardless 
of the agencies’ performance. Over time, bureaucrats become more concerned with funding, job 
security, and prestige, instead of follo wing its original function. This explains why the public 
poorly rates its dissatisfacti on of government agencies. Principal -agent view for the Fed is the  
chairman worries over  his or her  own self -interest and protects his  friends, such as the large 
commercial and investment banks.  
The Fed is independent of the U.S. Treasury Office, even thou gh some  Presidents  tried to 
influence it.  However,  a government budget deficit could  lead to money creation.  If the Fed 
maintains a constant interest rate , and the U.S. government operates  a budget deficit, the U.S. 
Treasury department can finance the deficit by issuing T -bills.  Nevertheless , the T-bill supply 
rises, causing  the market pri ce of T -bills to fall. Thus, market interest rates  rise. If the Fed 
maintains a fixed interest rate, it  must  buy the T -bills the Treasury issued, expanding  both bank 
reserves  and mon ey supply . Consequently,  a government budge t deficit leads to inflation if  a 
central bank focuses on the interest rate.  
Foreign countries differ in  their degree of independence between government and  their 
central banks.  For example, the Eurozone  and Switzerland have the most independent central 
banks in the w orld. Thus, these countries  experience the lowest inflation rates in the world. On 
the other  hand, the central banks in Russia, Kazakhstan, Thailand, a nd Turkey have  less 
independence  from their governments , and these countr ies experience  greater  inflation rates.  
A national go vernment’s financial health  determine s the level of independence betwee n the 
government and the cent ral bank. Political leaders boost  government spending to win favors 
with the public, but hesitant to raise taxes. Conse quently, a government would suffer from  a 
budget deficit that  its treasury can finance by selling government  bonds. As a government’s debt 
continually grows, investors will reac h a point when they  stop buying bonds. Unfortunately, 
political leaders refuse to  cut government programs  and subsidies  or raise taxes. Only  solution is 
the government forces its central bank to buy its bonds that investors do not want, even though it 
creates inflation.  
Many Americans and  experts believe the massive $17  trillion U.S. government debt  will 
lead to inflation  as the U.S. government fo rces the Federal Reserve to buy  its bonds . 
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve would lose its independence.  
The European Union experienced  a similar situation. Greece, Spain , Ireland, and Portugal 
reached  their debt limit s, and investors no long er want to buy these government s’ bonds. The 
European C entral Bank is independent of the member countries’ governments, and these 
countries cannot force the central bank t o buy their bonds. Instead, the governments  imposed 
austerity  measures, where they increased  taxes and reduced government  programs and subsi dies, 
sparking  massive protests and demonstrations against the government s. Furthermore, increasing 
taxes or decreasing government spending hinders economic growth. Consequen tly, many 
European countries had entered  a recession in 2012.  
The Greek  government  cannot control its  budget  deficit , and it forced  bonds holders to take 
a huge loss on the Greek bonds  in 2010 . Consequently, Greece lost its investors, and it will 
likely leave the Eurozone and reintroduce its currency , the drachma. The Greek citizens and  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
164 
 businesses know the Greek government will force its central bank to buy its bonds, causing th e 
inflation rate to increase while the drachma depreciate s against the euro. Public has started bank 
runs on Greek banks, withdrawing their euros and creating mor e financial hardship for Greece.  
Then Greece’s financial problems trickled into Cypress  in 2013 .  
Cypress is an offshore banking center that attracted sizeable deposits from British  and 
Russians. However, Cypress banks suffered huge losses from their Greek  bonds. The EU 
refused  to bail Cypress out and convinced the Cypress government to tax all bank account s over 
$100,000. Tax would cause depositors to withdraw their money and flee the country , called 
capital flight . We discuss capital flight  in Chapter 15.

 14. Monetary Policy Tools  
 
This chapter introduces the Federal Reserve’s three significant tools for conducting 
monetary policy: open -market operations, discount policy, and reserve requirements. 
Furthermore, the Fed uses monetary policy to influence the important macroeconomic variables 
in society  including the GDP growth rate and i ndirectly the unemployment rate , interest rates, 
currency excha nge rates, and asset prices such as  stock and bonds. Thus, many people, 
especially in the financial markets scrutinize the Fed’s act ions to determine monetary policy. 
Accurately predicting the Fed’s actions , financial companie s can reap  large profits. 
Unfortunately, a central bank using monetary policy  may create more  instability for an economy 
because of time lags , so we discuss several  problems of monetary policy.  
Open -Market Operations  
The Fed can use expansionary or contra ctionary monetary policies . Expansionary 
monetary policy  is the Federal Reserve expands the money supply and indirectly reduces the  
short -term interest rates  while contractionary monetary policy  is the Federal Reserve contracts  
the money supply that raises  short -term interest rates.  Moreover, the Fed can use  Open -Market 
Operations, Discount Policy, and Reserve Requirements to implement a monetary policy.  Open -
Market Operations  are the Fed’s purchase and sale of U.S. government securities , and its most 
impor tant tool . Open -market operations have the same effect if the Fed purchased any short -
term, liquid  securities.  However, the Fed usually buys and s ells U.S. government securities.  We 
also discuss Discount Policy and Reserve Requirements in their sections in  this chapter.  
The Fed , for example, wants to expand  the money supply by using  expansionary monetary 
policy.  In the T -bill market  as represented in Figure 1 , the original market price and quantity for 
T-bills are P* and Q*. Then the Fed buys T -bills, creat ing a greater demand for T -bills,  shifting 
the demand function  right ward . The Fed pays for the T -bills using  a “Fed check.”  After the 
seller deposits the check at his bank, then his or her  bank 's reserves increase, boosting the 
money supply  as banks grant  loans  to borrowers . Consequently, b oth the market price a nd 
quantity of T -bills rises . Then t he market interest rate falls for T -bills, when we calculate it 
using the present value formula .  
Noticing o ne thing , open -market operations affect the interest r ates because t he T -bill is a 
short -term credit instrument.  When the Fed  purchases  the T-bills, the T -bill's price rises  while  
the T -bill interest rate falls . Consequently, the decrease in the short -term interest rates spreads to 
other markets , including  the federal fund s rate,  commercial paper , and banker’s acceptances.  
Therefore, short -term interest rates on all short -term credit instruments will rise and fall 
together.  
Contractionary monetary policy works similarly  to expansionary monetary policy. Figure 2 
depicts m arket pr ice and quantity for T -bills as  P* and Q* . The Fed sells T -bills, increasing  the 
supp ly of T -bills and  shifting  the supply curve for T -bills right ward . Consequently, t he marke t 
price of T -bills falls  while  the market interest rate for T-bills rises by  using the present value Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
167 
 formula. Furthermore, the short -term interest rates for other credit instruments rise . Finally, t he 
bank s’ reserves fall , and banker s grant fewer loans that shrink  the money supply.  
 
Treasury B ill Market  
 
Figure  1. The Federal Reserve  increases the money supply  by purchasing T -bills 
 
Treasury B ill Market  
 
Figure  2. The Federal Reserve  decreases the money supply by selling T -bills 
 
The Fed can only control the growth rate of the money supply or short -term interest r ates, 
but not both at the same time . For example, the Fed increase s the M1 money supply by 3%. 
Consequently, t he Fed keeps buying T -bills unt il the M1 money supply expands  by 3%. 
However, short -term interest rates fall . The Fed cannot prevent  the falling  interest rates  because  
it focused  on the money supply.  On the other hand, the Fed wants to  reduce the short -term 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
168 
 interest rates to 4%.  If the current interest rate equals  6%, subsequently, the Federal Reserve 
keeps buying T -bills until t he interest falls to 4%. Nevertheless , as the Fed continually buys T -
bills, both the banks' reserves and  the money supply expand. T he Fed has no control over the 
money supply  because  it focused  on the interest rates. Thus, the Fed can either affect  short -term 
interest rates  or the money supply, but not both at the same time.  
Federal Open Market Committee  
The Fed formed  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  to implement monetary 
policy by buying or selling assets like U.S. government securities.  The FOMC meets ei ght times 
per year and issues a  general directive  that states the objective for the monetary aggregates and 
interest rates.  Furthermore, th e Federal Reserve Bank of New York is responsible in  carry ing 
out the general directive.  The Fed B ank of New York deals with ab out 40 dealers who specialize 
in U.S. government securities (i.e. secondary market).  The New York Fed and dealers are 
connected electronically . When the Fed is ready to buy or sell gove rnment securities, the Fed 
ask these dealers to bid . Then the  Fed buys or sells to the dealers with the best offer.  The Open 
Market Trading Desk  is the department within the New York Fed Bank that  buys and sells  the 
government securities.   
When the trading desk at the Fed conducts monetary action, the trading desk can use 
dynamic or  defensive transactions . A dynamic transaction  is the Fed uses a transaction to meet 
the monetary policy as specified in the general directive.  A defensive transaction  is the Fed uses 
open -market operations to offset fluctuations in bank reserves . The Fed uses defensive 
transactions  more than dynamic transactions.  For example, the bank s’ reserves fall, as people 
withdraw money from their bank accounts to buy presents at Christmas or when people pay their 
taxes in April.  Consequently , the money sup ply decreases around Christmas and April.  
Further more , natural disasters and employee s' strikes can delay the delivery of the mail.  A mail 
delay slows  the Fed’s check clearing process.  Thus, th e float rises, expanding  both bank s' 
reserves and money supply . Accordingly, t he Fed uses defensive transaction to offset temporary 
fluctuations in bank reserves  to stabilize the money supply . 
The Fed can use outright purchases and sales  or use  repurchase agreements. First, the Fed 
uses outright purchases and sales , when it sells or buys a security,  and the transaction is 
permanent.  Dealer who bought the security has no obligation in the future to sell the security  to 
the Fed or vice -versa.  Second , the Fed uses the Federal Rese rve repurchase agreement (REPO)  
to buy securities from a dealer , and the dealer agrees to repurchase the securities for a specific 
price a nd on a particular  date in the future.  This is similar to a bank repurchase agreement.  
Usually, the dealer buys  back the government security  within 15 days.  Consequently, t he REP O 
injects temporary reserves into  the banking system. For example,  people around Christmas time 
withdraw enormous amounts of currency from the financial institutions  because  they b uy 
Christmas presents with cash . Accordingly, the Fed  uses a REPO to inject reserves  temporarily  
in the banking system to offset the currency drain.  After  Christmas , the currency returns  to the 
financial institutions. Then the REPO expires, and the temporary reserves are removed from the 
banking s ystem, when the dealer repurchases  the REPO.   Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
169 
 The Fed can  do the opposite of a REPO , called the Reverse REPO . The Fed sells securities 
to the dealers, and the dealers sell the securities  back to the Fed for a specific price and on a 
particular  data in the future.  Thus, th e reserve REPO temporarily lowers excess reserves in the 
banking system.  
The Fed has four reasons why open -market operations are its  most popular  and important  
tool. First, the Fed can completely control how many securities  it buys or sell s. Second, open -
market operations are very flexible.  The Fed can influence bank reserves by a little am ount by 
buying few  U.S. government securities  or by a large amount by buying many  securities.  Third, if 
the Fed mak es a mistake by buying too many U.S. government securit ies, then it can turn around 
and sell them to correct its mistake . Finally, the Fed can implement open -market operations very  
quickly.  
Many people scrutinize the Fed , and they read th e Fed's directives  for its open -market 
trading desk.  However, these direc tives are  vague and  not precise, crea ting the principal -agent 
problem.  If the directives are vague, then the outcome does not matter.  The Fed can deem any 
outcome as a success, making the Fed unaccountable for errors.   
Many  central banks  across the world,  including the  European Central Bank use open -
market operations similar ly to the United States.  Although some countries have a small market 
for government securities, central banks can buy and sell any assets.  
Discount Policy  
Fed’s second monetary policy tool is the discount policy . The Fed can grant loans to 
financial inst itutions. For example, a bank experiences financial problems and needs reserves. 
Consequently, the bank sells a $10,000 T -bill t o the Fed, and the Fed boosts  bank’s reser ves by 
$9,000. The discount is  the difference  while the T -bill becomes  the collateral of the loan. 
Eventually, the bank repays the Fed loan , and afterwards, the Fed returns the  T-bill for $10,000  
to the bank . The $1,000 difference reflects the interest rat e the Fed charges for the loan , called 
the discount rate . Traditionally, the Fed only loaned  to banks that were members of the Federal 
Reserve System. Currently, any bank in the U.S. can borr ow from the Fed, and the Fed may  not 
require  collateral for the l oan. 
Each Fed district bank provides loans, known as the “ discount window .” Furthermore, the 
Fed could  use discount policy to influence the money supply and interest rates.  For example, 
Figure 3 shows the Federal Fun ds Market, where banks lend their  reserv es at the Fed to other 
banks . Consequently, the banks electronically transfer these funds through the Fedwire.  Demand 
function constitutes  the banks’ demand for federal funds.  These banks  borrow funds to ensure 
they hold  enough reserves to meet depositors’  withdrawals or satisfy the Fed’s reserve 
requirements.  Demand curve is downward sloping  because  banks borrow more funds  if the 
interest rate decreases (i.e. the loans are cheaper).  Supply function represents  the banks’ supply 
of federal funds to the market  because  these banks hold  excess reserves.  These banks 
temporarily lend out excess reserves, so they can earn interest income.  Supply function is 
upward sloping  because  banks lend more funds  for a greater in terest rate  (i.e. they earn higher 
profits).  Intersection of  the deman d and supply curves determines  the equilibrium interest rate 
(i*) and amount of reserves (R* ).  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
170 
  
The Federal Funds Market  
 
Figure  3. The Federal Reserve  uses the discount rate to increa se money supply  
 
The Fed could  use the discount rate for  expansionary monetary policy. For instance, t he Fed 
decreases the discount rate , depicted in Figure 3 . Then the banks borrow  cheaply from the Fed, 
boosting the reserves  in the banking system. Thus, b anks have more reserves to lend. Supply 
function for  the federal funds market increases and shifts right ward . Consequently, t he interest 
rate for federal funds fall  and both the monetar y base and money supply expand . 
Contract ionary monetary policy works si milarly to expansionary monetary policy.  Figure 4 
shows t he Federal Fun ds Market.  Market interest rate is i*  while  the equilibrium reserves are 
R*. For example,  the Fed raises the discount rate.  Banks borrow less from the Fed  because  loans 
have great er interest rates.  Thus, banks h ave fewer reserves, causing reserves in the banking 
system to fall . Consequently, t he banks have fewer reserves  to lend, shifting  the s upply for 
Federal Funds  leftward . Interest rate rise  while  both the monetar y base and money supply 
shrink .  
The Fed can grant adjustment, seasonal, or extended credits . Adjustment credit  is a short -
term loan to help banks,  experiencing  short -term liquidity problems.  Seasonal credit  is a loan to  
help small banks , located in  agriculture  areas or to urist destinations. These areas  experience 
wide fluctuations in income  because  farmers harvest crops once or twice a year, and touris ts 
visit an area during high season . Finally, the Fed could grant an  extended credit . For instance, a 
large bank is on the verge of bankruptcy and has severe liquidity problems.  Thus, th e Fed grants 
a long-term loan to this bank, preventing a bank failure.   
The Fed along with FDIC  could extend  loans  to restore the financial health of the bank.  For 
example, Continental Illinois  Bank , the 8th largest U.S. bank,  failed during the 1970s  because it 
granted too  many bad loans.  The FDIC purchased 80% of the bank’s stock and elected new 
management.  Thus , the U.S. government nationalized the bank  because  the bank became  too big 
to fail  while the Fed provided  $3.5 billion  in loans  to the FDIC.  During  the 20 08 Financial 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
171 
 Crisis, the Fed had  granted up to $2 trillion in loans to prevent some of the largest banks and 
financial companies in the United States from failing.  
 
The Federal Funds Ma rket 
 
Figure  4. The Federal Reserve  uses the discount rate to decrease money supply  
 
Banks can abuse the discount window . For example, a bank could borrow f unds from the 
Fed at 2% and lend  these funds out at 5%, earning 3% interest on the Fed  loans.  The F ed 
counters this problem by investigating and  auditing the bank more, ensuring  the bank is 
complying with regulations.  Moreover, the Fed can  impose fines or publicly criticize the bank.  
A bank borrowing from the Fed  indicate s financial weakness.  Finally, the Fed may stop lending 
to the bank  because  borrowing from the Fed is a privilege and not a right!  Many economists 
argue  the Fed s hould set the discount rate great er than  a comparable short -term interest rate . 
That way, bo rrowing from the Fed becomes a  penalty because  a bank borrows at  a higher 
interest rate than the market.  The European Central Bank uses the penalty interest rate to prevent 
its banks from abusing  its loans.  
The Fed implemented the Term Auction Facility (TAF) Program  after the 2008 Financi al 
Crisis. Fed specifies the total amount of discount loans  that it is willing to provide to the banks 
while the b anks competitively bid for the se funds. Then the Fed uses the b idding process to set 
the interest rate for  loans .  
Fed’s  discount policy  provi des four benefits  to the banking system . First, the Fed is the 
“lender of the last resort.”  If a bank has trouble with liquidity or needs reserves, and it cannot 
borrow from other banks, subsequently, the Fed is  the last place to go  to ask for a loan . Seco nd, 
the Fed creates the announcement effect , when the discount rate unexpectedl y changes. Rate 
change provides information to the financial markets  because  the Fed conducts monetary policy  
secretly.  For example, the Fed raises the discount rate . Press, politicians, and financial analyst s 
think the Fed is  tightening  monetary policy, i.e. contracting the money supply.  Third, the Fed 
uses moral suasion , which means t he Fed uses its power to persuade depository institutions to do 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
172 
 what the Fed wants.  A loan f rom the  Fed is a privilege, and not a right.  If a bank needs a loan 
from the Fed , and the bank did not do what the Fed wanted, then the  Fed could refuse to  loan to 
the bank.  Finally, the Fed uses the discount policy to prevent a  financial crisis.  The Fed c an lend 
as much as the banks need. Thus, the Fed  calm s the financial markets by stating its discount 
policy.  
Discount policy is not a good tool to control the money supply.  For instance , if the Fed 
wants to increase the money supply, the Fed must  grant mor e discount loans to banks.  However, 
the Fed cannot force banks to accept its loans. Then if the Fed pursues contractionary mo netary 
policy, the Fed must call in loans  from the banks , causing  hardship . These loans mean  banks are 
experiencing financial probl ems, and the Fed could harm them by taking the loans away . 
Public and financial analysts scrutinize the federal funds market to predict monetary policy.  
For example, w hen the public and financial analysts see the fede ral funds interest rate fall , they 
infer the Fed is using expansionary policy.  On the other hand, i f the federal funds rate ri ses, the 
public believes the Fed is using contractionary monetary policy.  As you know from this chapter, 
the Fed cannot control the federal funds rate, but can only infl uence it.  Other factors can cause 
the Federal Funds rate to rise or fall.  
Reserve Requirements  
Fed can use reserve requirements  as a monetary tool . Reserve requirements are the ratio of 
reserves to deposits that banks must hold to satisfy depositors’ withdrawals.  Banks store 
reserves as vault cash  or deposits at the Fed.  The Fed has the power to set reserve requirements 
for banks within the limits set by Congress.  The Fed rarely changes the reserve requirements  
because  changes in the reserve requiremen ts have a significant and disruptive impact on the 
banking system.  Table 1 shows the c urrent reserve req uirements and the d ate the Fed last 
changed them. Consequently, the Fed has not changed reserve requirements since 1990.  
 
Table  1. The Federal Reserve Required Reserve Requirements

   More than $44.4 million  10 1-09-90 
  
Nonpersonal time deposits  0 12-27-90 
 
 
The Fed can use reserve requirements to alter the money supply. If the Fed believes banks 
are holding too many excess reserves, then banks would  create  high inflation in the future. Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
173 
 When banks start lending their excess reserves  out as loans, these loans ret urn as deposits, 
expanding  the money supply, creating the multiple deposit expansion. Consequently, the Fed 
can increase the reserve requirement ratio, switching  some excess reserves  to required reserves.  
Money multiplier (1 ÷  rr) increases if the Fed reduces  the reserve requirement , and vice 
versa . For example, if the required reserve ratio equals  10%, and the Fed buys a $10,000 T -bill 
using a Fed check, subsequently, the money supply could potentially expand by $100,000 ( or 
$10,000 ÷  0.10). If the Fed lo wered the reserve requirement  to 5%, and it purchased a $10,000 
T-bill, then the money supply can potentially in crease to $200,000 ( or $10,000 ÷  0.05). Thus, 
the Fed rarely chang es the reserve requirement s because  this tool is too powerful. Small changes 
in the reserve requirement could have an enormous impact on the banking system and the 
money supply.  
Economists and policymakers believe reserve requirements are not an effective monetary 
policy tool  because the following r eason s: 
 
 Changing the reserve requirements is  too powerful  because  small changes in r eserve 
requirements have a great  impact on the  money multiplier and the  money supply.  
 Required rese rves impose a cost to the banks because they cannot lend these reserves to 
borrowers, and therefore, do not earn interest income on required reserves.  Instead, the 
reserves sit in a vault as cash or as deposits at the Fed.   
 Purpose of reserve requir ements is to make deposits safe  and maintain a  stable banking 
system.  However, if the majority of the depositors came to their bank to withdraw their 
deposits, then the bank would still fail.  Unfortunately, t he banks hold fewer  than 10% of 
the deposits as vault cash and/or deposits at the Fed.  Thus, reserve requirements would  not 
preven t bank runs  and does  not stabilize the banking system.  Only deposi t insurance can 
help prevent  bank runs.  
 Reserve requirement ratios are components of the money multiplier.  Thus, th e Fed must 
maintain a constant  money multiplier and reserve requirements  in order for  the Fed to 
control the money supply.  No e mpirical evidence indicates  reserve requirements improve 
the stability of the money multiplier.  Moreover , banks would  still hold reserves  to meet 
depositors’ withdrawals  if a central bank did not impose reserve requirements.  
Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate, suggested the  central bank should impose a 100% 
reserve requirement  on banks . Accordingly, t he banks wou ld hold all deposits either at the Fed 
and/or  vault cash.  Bankin g system could not create  multiple deposit expansion , and the money 
multiplier would be one.  For example, if the Fed purchased  a $10,000 T -bill, both the monetary 
base and t he money supply would expand  by exactly $10,000.  Consequently, the Fed  has 
complete  control over  the money supply  with a 100% reserve requirement . Banks would hold all 
deposits as reserves, so they could meet depositor’s withdrawals.  Moreover, the U.S. 
government could eliminate  federal deposit insurance and substantially reduce bank reg ulations.  
How ever, b anks could not lend  under this system, causing the financial intermediation process Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
174 
 to break down.  Banks link savers to the investors.  Thus, the whole ec onomy would need 
restructuring , and another financial institution would evolve into  something similar to a bank 
that would lend to businesses and households . 
Monetary Policy Goals  
Goal of monetary policy is to increase the well -being of society. Economists measure well -
being  in terms of th e quantity and quality of goods  and services that  people consume. The Fed 
has six monetary policy goals , which are:  
Price stability : Product prices  communicate information to households and businesse s. 
Households determine how many goods to buy  while businesses determine how many  goods to 
produce. Inflation is a continual  increase in prices of goods, and services , and it  erode s the value 
of money. Furthermore, a high inflation rate becomes  more variable , thus, creating uncertainty 
for businesses, consumers, and workers. The uncertainty leads to adve rse effects on decisions 
and hinders economic growth . If the inflation rate soars, then money’s functions of a “store of 
value” and “medium of exchange” breaks down.  
High employment : The Federal Reserve a nd the federal government  reduce  unemployment 
as muc h as possible  because  massive unemployment cau ses human misery. As workers remain  
idle, factory space and equipment become underutilized. When a society does not use all its 
resources, an  economy’s GDP grows at a slow rate  or even decrease s. Government cannot 
reduce  the unemployment rate to zero. In some  cases, unemployment occurs when workers  quit 
their jobs and lo ok for new ones, or students  graduate and enter the labor market. The Fed tries 
to lower the unemployment rate to the natural rate of unemployme nt. Currently, economists 
estimate the natural rate of unemployment to be  6% for the United States. If the Fed strives for 
an unemployment rate below  6%, then the Fed’s policy creates  inflation.  
Economic growth : A growing economy has an increasing real GDP because society 
produces  more goods and services.  A high real GDP growth rate lowers the unemployment rate  
while businesses earn profits. Then they raise  their investment, producing  more goods and 
services . Furthermore, strong economic growth caus es increasing income s for businesses and 
households.  When businesses and households have higher incomes, the local, state, and federal 
governments collect more tax revenue s. Thus, the Fed uses monetary policy to spur  strong 
economic growth.  
Financial marke t and institution stability : Financial panics, bank runs, stock market 
crashes, or bankruptcies of large financial institution s could  trigger a chain reaction that  causes 
other financial institutions to bankrupt.  Unfortunately, a  financial panic disrupts  the link 
between savers and investors.  Then businesses do  not receive loans they need to invest  while 
customers do not  receive loans to buy homes, cars, and other assets.  If the financial market s and 
institutions break down, t hen the economy  can enter  a severe recession, causing high 
unemployment and slow or negative GDP growth rates.  Consequently, t he Fed stabilizes the 
financial system by being a “lender of the last resort ,” prevent ing financial panics.  
Interest rate stability : The Fed stabilizes the inter est rates  because  fluctuating interest rates  
create uncertainty in the economy, and businesses, and househ olds experience difficulties  
planning fo r the future. Businesses become  uncertain about investing in new buildings, Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
175 
 machines, and equipment  while  consumers are  unsure about long -term investments, such as 
buying a house or car. Interest rate stability  is related to the stability of the financial markets. 
Larg e swings in interest rates can  cause sizeable capital gains and lo sses in the financial 
mark ets. Consequently, some investors earn profits  while  others earn losses.  
Foreign -exchange market stability : The Fed tries to stabilize the  U.S. dollar’s  value against 
the m ajor currencies, such as the Japanese yen and European euro. A strong U.S. dollar ca uses 
U.S products to become relatively more expensive to foreigners  while  foreign -made products 
become cheaper to U.S.  citizens. Thus, consumers buy more foreign produc ts, raising imports  
while  U.S. businesses sell fewer products abr oad, shrinking  exports.  If the U.S. dollar weakens , 
then U.S. imports and exports do the opposite. U.S. products become cheaper to foreigners  
while  foreign -made goods become more expensive. Thus, U.S. exports rise  while import s fall . 
Some of these goals conflict with each other.  For example, if the Fed pursues monetary 
policy that expands the money supply, boosting  national output and lowering  the unemployment 
rate. However , exp ansionary monetary policy can trigger  inflation. Then  the nominal interest 
rates begin to increase  because of the higher expectations of inflation , the Fisher Effect.  
The European Central Bank , on the other hand,  has only one policy goal – price stability. 
The ECB defines pr ice stability as  an inflation rate of 2% or less. Thus, this extremely low 
inflation  rate causes the exchan ge rate of the euro to strengthen  relative to other currencies , 
which we discuss  in Chapter 16 . 
Time Lags and Targets  
The Fed cannot influence the monetary policy goals directly.  The Fed uses its tools, open -
market operations, discou nt rates, and reserve requirements, to i nfluence indirectly its  policy 
goals.  Unfortunately,  three time lags hinder  monetary policy . First,  the Fed eral Reserve or 
government  needs data and information  before it can do anything , the information lag . For 
instance, government calculates the unemployment rate monthly and  estimates GDP data  
quarterly . The government requires nine months to know whether the economy has entered a  
recession  because economists define a recession as  two consecutive quarters of negati ve real 
GDP growth. Thus, a government  know s the economy is in a recession by the end of the third 
quarter . Second, t he Fed eral Reserve or government  must study the data, and then they devise  
and approve a policy , the administrative lag . Finally, a monetar y policy does not impact the 
economy immediately. It takes time when the Fed implements a policy until it shows up o n the 
economy , the impact lag . 
Time lags can amplify the business cycle . For example, the economy entered a recession 
that lasted only on e year. Then the economy returned  to the full -employment lev el. 
Unfortunately, the government takes three months to collect quarterly GDP data. The GDP 
needs two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth before a recession is declared. Thus, 
the Fed must w ait nine months to determine whethe r the economy has entered  a recession. If the 
administrative lag is one month while the impact lag equals  six months, then the Fed’s policy 
takes hold after one year and four months to influence the economy , or 9 + 1 +6 . If the Fed 
counteracted this recession, subsequen tly, the Fed  make s the economy more unstable. After  the Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
176 
 economy returns  to the full -empl oyment level, the Fed’s polic y kicks in, expanding  the economy 
and creating inflation.  
The Fed uses operating targets a nd intermediate  targets to reduce the problems with time 
lags. The Fed uses its tools to influence the intermediate targets , and the intermediate targets 
directly affect the price level, unemployment  rate, and economic growth rate . Moreover, t he Fed 
has mo re control over the intermediate targets , and the time lags are shorter.  Intermediate 
targets include  the M1, M2, and M3 definitions of the money supply and short -term interest 
rates.  
Fed has  more control over operating targets  than intermediate targets.  Operating targets are 
the federal funds rate and non -borrowed reserves.  Federal funds rate is the interest rate that 
banks charge for lending their excess reserves to other banks.  When th e Fed uses open -market  
operations, c hanges discount policy, or alters  reserve requirement,  the Fed’s monetary policy 
has an immediate impact on the federal funds rate and non -borrowed reserves.  When the Fed 
implements monetary policy, s uch as a creating a greater GDP growth rate, the Fed’s policy 
immediately affects the ope rating targets , and, in turn, influence the intermediate targets , such as  
GDP growth rate.  Accordingly, t he Fed monitors changes in the intermediate and operating 
targets , determining whether monetary policy is affecting the economy  correctly . 
The Fed uses  three criteria  to select an  intermediate target . First, the Fed must easily 
measure the intermediate target in order to overcome information lags. Second,  the Fed must  
have control over the intermediate target to overcome the impact lag. For example, the Fed can 
influence the money sup ply, but not the GDP growth rate. M any factors influence the GDP 
growth rate, and the Fed cannot influence all of them. Thus, the Fed would never select GDP as 
an intermediate target. Finally, t he Fed selects  intermediate tar gets that  influence  the policy 
goals  predictably . For example, the Fed influences the M1 definition of the money supply, and 
M1 sometimes influences the unemployment rate, while at other times, it does not. Therefore, 
M1 would not be a good intermediate ta rget. 
Before the 1990s, the Fed alternated  back and forth between interest rate and money supply 
targets. This strategy was not successful  because  the Fed’s monetary policy caused more 
instability in the economy.  Economists refer this to procyclical monetary policy , which means 
the Fed amplifies the business cycle. Monetary policy further expands a  grow ing economy 
creating inflation, or it strengthens a  severe recessi on. For example, the Fed selected  interest 
rates as  its intermediate target. A  growin g economy causes interest rates to rise . For the Fed to 
lower the interest rates, it  must buy more U.S. government securities. Consequently, the bond's 
prices increase, causing the interest rates to drop. Nevertheless, the bank reserves expand  the 
money su pply, expanding  the economy  faster. On the other hand, as an economy enters  a 
recession, the n interest rates  fall. If the Fed wants to boost the interest rates, subsequently, the 
Fed must sell U.S. government securities. Thus, the price of t he securities d ecreases, increasing 
the interest rates . However, bank reserves falls, contracting  the money supply and worsening a 
recession . Since the 1990s, t he Fed has emphasized a low inflation  goal, and this policy h as been  
successful. Europe and Japan also emphasiz e price stability and low inflation rates.  
Economists suggested  the Fed use other intermediate targets , such as the following:  
 Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
177 
  Nominal GDP:  If an economy produces more goods and services, then  both real and 
nominal GDP increase.  If inflation cause s higher  prices, subsequently, the greater  prices 
increase  nominal GDP, but have no effect  on real GDP.  Some economists believe th e Fed 
cannot  influence real GDP, but it  can affect  the inflatio n rate, which in turn affects  the 
nominal GDP.  If the Fed selected nomi nal GDP as an intermediate target, then the Fed 
would be focusing on price stability  indirectly .  
 Yield Curve:  Some economists suggested the Fed use the yield curve as an intermediate 
target.  Although t he F ed examines the yield curve,  the yield curve's shape depends on 
investors' expectations of inflation and real interest rates.   
 Commodity prices:  Some economists suggested  the Fed focus on  commodity prices . 
However, commodity prices do not accurately predict inflation well.   
 U.S. dollar exchange rate:  Exchange rates can  predict infla tion and real GDP growth rate. 
Nevertheless, the exchange rate could respond  to changes in the interest rate  between 
countries . International investors invest in countries with high real interest rates.  
Monetary policy can  become ineffective in some case s. For instance, Japan entered  a 
perpetu al recession, starting in  the 1990s.  Business es and consumers became  very pessimistic; 
when the Japanese central  bank lowered the interest rate, but  it had no impact on the economy.  
After  the housing bubble popped in 2007 in the Unite d States, the Federal Reserve has pursued  
expansionary monetary policy.  However, the U.S. economy is falter ing and sputtering still in 
2013 , even with a discount rate close to zero!   
Japanese and U.S. struggling economies  lead to the idea of cyclical asymmetry , which is the 
contractionary monetary policy is always effective, w hile expansionary monetary can  be 
impotent at times. T hus, the low interest rates do  not change consumers' and investors' behavio r, 
but high interest rates do. Consequently, some  experts believe a central bank  should  concentrate 
only on one target - inflation. Thus, a centr al bank should not focus on the economy  but 
maintain low inflation. Central banks in Canada, Eurozone, New Zealand, Sweden, and United 
Kingdom mai ntain low inflation rates, causing  appreciating currencies. If an economy has over a 
10% inflation rat e, then most likely the  central bank is increasing the money supply too quickly  
while the central bank pursues othe r targets not related to price stability. Finally, a country with 
an independent  central bank from government could experience low inflation rates  because  the 
central bank  can focus on price stability and not h elp its government finance its budget.

 15. The International Financial System  
Governments and central banks often intervene in the foreign -exchange markets.  Developed 
countries like the United Stat es and Europe tend to maintain strong  currencies  while  China and 
the Asian T igers tend to weaken their currencies.  Thus, international investors prefer to hold 
strong currencies, while the Asian countries weaken their currency to boost their export 
industries, creating jobs and wealth.  This cha pter examines a central bank’s intervention in its  
currency exchange markets , and the impact of a country’s  balance -of-payment s upon its 
exchange rate. Moreover, the world has used three exchange rate regimes: the gold standard, 
Bretton Woods System, and f lexible exchange rates.  We discuss t hese exc hange rate regimes  in 
detail along with  the international institutions:  International Monetary Fund and World Bank.  
Balance of Payments  
Balance of payments record s all transactions between the households, busines ses, and 
government of one country to the rest of the world. It is a cash flow statement  and not a balance 
sheet. Economists use balance -of-payments accounts to compare the total flow of money 
between one country and the rest of the world , and economists a lways measure it  in a country ’s 
currency . We show the 2011 b alance of payments  for the United S tates in Table 1 .

Balance of payments uses the accounting double entry system, where total debits equal total 
credits. A  payment by U.S. resident, business, or government to another country represents  a Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
181 
 deficit item  or negative  because  money is  leaving the United States. Several  example s of deficit 
items include  a U.S. resident  buys imported goods, sen ds money to relatives in  foreign 
countries, or travels abroad. A country’s residents or government receiving money for  
transaction s is a surplus item , and t he number is positive  because  money enters  the United 
States. Several  example s of surplus items incl ude U.S. firm  export s goods to another country. 
U.S. residents receive money from foreigners, o r foreigners travel to  the United States.  
Current account  summarizes the purchases and sales of goods and services  between the 
United States and the rest of the world . The first item  is the trade balance , which  equals  total 
export s minus total imports , and it is usually the largest item . If the trade balance is positive, 
then more money flows into the country than leaves  because money moves in the opposite 
directi on of good s and services . If the trade balance is negative, subsequently, more money 
flows out of the country than in  as the country buys more products and services from the world . 
Furthermore, t he current account includes the items for  shipping, brokerage, and insurance for 
the ships and airpl anes tha t deliver the cargo. Then economists add investment income to the 
current account . We  must  be careful  because  investments are  financial transactions that 
economists record  under the financi al accoun t. However, economists record the income from 
those investments  under  the current account. Finally,  the current account includes unilateral 
transfers between nations such as  foreign aid, private gifts, and money sent to relatives living in 
another  country.  
For the United States, the current account balanc e equaled -$465.9 b illion in 2011 . Current 
account is negative  because  more  money left the United States  than entered, causing a current 
account deficit . Subsequently, the United States  finance s this deficit  by borrow ing from 
foreigners . Current account deficit is large  because  the United States i mported more goods than  
exported. The U.S. trade balance was -$494.7 billion in 2011 . 
Financial account  equaled $555.1 b illion in 2011 , and it records all transactions for stocks, 
bonds, and real estate between the United States and the rest of the world. If the financial 
account is positive, then more money flowed  into the United States  than left , called a financial 
inflow. Consequently, the Uni ted States borrows  from foreigners  because  they invested  more 
assets in the United States than the amount the U.S. residents bought foreign assets . If the 
financial account is negative, then  more  money is flowing out of the United States  than flowing 
in, called a capital o utflow. Thus, a country is  lending to foreigners  because  the value o f foreign 
assets bought by residents exceeds  the amount of as sets foreigner s bought inside the country . 
The U.S. businesses, for instance, bought $483.7 b illion in foreign  stocks, bonds, and real 
estate  while  foreigners  bought $1,001. 0 billion of financial and property assets within the United 
States. Furthermore, approximately $39.0 b illion flowe d into the United States for  purchasing of 
financial derivative s. Finally, the  capital account experienced a net outflow of a negative $1.2 
billion. Capital account represents  the purchase of assets used in manufacturing and production, 
and the production has not started yet. For e xample, a U.S. firm buys a coal mine in a foreign 
country, and it has not started to extract coal yet. Then economists record this transaction under 
the capital account.  
If a country has a current account deficit, then  a financial surplus finances this deficit . For 
example, the United States has operated  current account deficits for the last 45  years.  It imports Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
182 
 more goods and services than it exports, causing  an outflow of U.S. dollars into the foreign 
exchange markets. International investors obtain U.S. dollars and use it to buy assets in the 
United St ates, creating  a financial account surplus . Foreigners invest in government securities, 
stocks, bonds, and real es tate in the United States. Balance -of-payments equation  shows this 
relationship in Equation 1, which is the current account plus the financial  account  should  equal 
zero.  
 
Balance of Payments (BOP) = current account  + financial account = 0    (1) 
 
We use Equation 1 as an equilibrium equation to predict changes in a country’s exchange 
rate. If a country’s balance of payments equals zero, then that country’s exchange rate may not 
change. For example, the United States has a current account deficit, causing U.S. dollars to 
flow into the foreign -exchange markets. Foreign countries collect these U .S. dollars and invest 
them  in the United States. What happens  if the  foreign investors do not want  to invest in the 
United States? Consequently, b alance of payments becomes negative, causing the U.S . dollar to 
weaken or to  depreciate  because  the international markets have a surplus of U.S. doll ars. 
Subsequently,  a weaker U.S. dollar  cause s the c urrent account to shrink over time  as imports fall  
while  exports rise  until restoring equilibrium . 
If the Federal Reserve does not want the dollar to weaken, then it can buy these U.S. dollars 
by using officia l reserve assets. The Federal Reserve can finance a balance -of-payment deficit or 
reduce U.S. dollars on the international market by doing one or m ore of the following:  
 
 The Fed could s ell gold to buy U.S. dollars.  
 The Fed could s ell foreign currencies an d buy U.S. dollars.  
 The Fed could b orrow from foreign central banks.  
 The Fed could u se its reserves at the International Monetary Fund or ask the International 
Monetary Fund  for a loan . 
 The Fed could u se Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).  We discuss them furth er under the 
Exchange Rate  Regimes . 
Economists record o fficial reser ve assets under the Financial A ccount  as the U.S. Official 
Reserve Assets . In 2011 , the official settlements balance was a minus $15.9 b illion , and we 
already included this balance  in the financial account  in Table 1 . The Federal Reserve paid 
$15.9 b illion  by selling assets to foreign countries , which we itemize d in Table 2 . 
Economists add a non -zero amount called  statistical discrepancy  to force  the curr ent 
account plus  financial account to equal zero . Discrepancy arises  from measurement errors , and 
some people and businesses do not repor t revenue from illegal businesses , evade taxes, or hide 
their money from their government in another country.  People h iding money is a form of capital Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
183 
 flight that we  discuss  further in this chapter.  Statistical discrepancy was a minus $89.2 billion in 
2011.

China and the Asian tigers  weaken their currencies because they boost  their exports. 
Consequently, these countries experience trade surpluses, causing  more money to flow in than 
out. The governments can use this money  inflow to purchase  U.S. government debt, real estate, 
and stocks and bonds in U.S. corporations. Th us, th e U.S.  debt and trade deficits  go together , 
and we discuss them under the He gemony section in this chapter. Furthermore, the Asian 
countries can use this money inflow to buy machines and equipment from developed countries, 
boosting their investment even fu rther.  
The Exchange Rate Regimes  
Nations implement a regime or system  to se ttle international payments  arising  from  
international trade and finance  because nation s must use a system to settle payment s between 
themselves. This system is  the exchange rate regime . 
First and oldest exchange rate regime is the  gold standard  that starte d with the Greek and 
Roman civilizations. Then , the world used the gold standard between 1876 and 1913 b efore 
World War I  plunged the world in to war. A gold standard  is a central bank  sets an exchange 
rate of their currency to gold.  Subsequently,  the central bank agrees  to convert their currency to 
gold on demand.  For example, the United States , Japan, and Britain establish the following 
exchange rates  as Equations 2. 
 
2,000 U.S. dollars = 1 ounce of gold        (2) 
 
200,000 Japanese yen = 1 ounce of gold  
 
4,000  British pounds = 1 ounce of gold  
 
If the U.S. central bank wants a money supply of $4 0 million, it  must  buy and hold 2 0,000 
ounces of gold, which is $40 million ÷  $2,000 per ounce . For a central bank to boost  the money 
supply  or grant emerge ncy loans to banks , it must  buy and store more  gold.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
184 
 Gold s tandard forces fixed exchange rates , which economists call  a fixed exchange rate 
system . Consequently, one U.S. dollar equal s 100 yen or 2 pounds.  We calculate the e xchange 
rates  in Equations 3. First, we set all currencies equal to on e ounce of  gold. Then we divide by 
one currency’s coefficient, yielding  the exchange rates, which in this  case, we divide all 
numbers  by 2,000 : 
 
1 ounce of gold = $2,0 00 = 2 00,000 yen = 4,000 pounds     (3) 
 
pounds=yen =$pounds=yen=$
2 10012,0004,000
2,000200,000
2,0002,000
 
 
A gold standard  helps countries maintain a zero balance of pay ments. For example, the U.S. 
experiences  a payments deficit with Japan, where the current account plus the fin ancial account 
is negative . Consequently, U.S. dollars are fl owing out of the United States and into Japan. On 
the other hand, Japan accumulates  U.S. dollars, and the Japanese  central bank exchanges the 
U.S. dollars for gold from the U.S. central bank . Then gold begins flowing out of the United 
States and into Jap an. Once the U.S. central bank possesses less  gold, it must  contract the money 
supply.  Remember, the money supply  fixes the  ratio between gold the government is holding  
and the currency in circulation . When the money supply declines , the prices in the econom y will 
decrease , called deflation  or negative inflation. Thus, U.S. products become cheaper than other 
countries ’ products . Then  the U.S. businesses export more goods abroad  while  the lower U.S. 
prices cause foreign products become more expensive. Hence, the U.S. consumers buy less 
imported goods. U.S. exports became larger while  imports smaller, increasing the current 
account  until it equals zero and gold stops flowing out of the United States. Exact opposite 
would  occur in J apan. Cons equently, a gold standard automatically  eliminates  trade deficits and 
surpluses.  
Gold standard has four  benefits:  
Benefit 1:  High inflation rates were rare under the gold standard  because  central banks had  
little control over the money supply. If  a central bank wants to increase the money supply, then 
the central  bank must  buy gold. For example, the inflation rate averaged less than 1% in U.S. 
under the gold standard. Consequently, a gold standard constrains a central bank’s ability to 
expand the money supply.  
Benefit 2:  International investors have  a lower risk  because  exchange rates do not fluctuate. 
All exchang e rates become  fixed  that eliminates the exchange rate risk . 
Benefit 3:  Gold standard greatly constrains a government’s power. For insta nce, c entral 
banks have little power to influence the money supply, and hence, they cannot pursue policies to 
influence the ir economies . Thus, gold goes  hand to hand with free markets, strong property 
rights, and limited government , but t his benef it depend s on the reader’s viewpoint  because  this 
could be a problem (Gold Standard, pp. viii -ix). During the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Fed eral 
Reserve  granted $2 trillion for emergency loans to banks, which would be impossible under a 
gold standard.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
185 
 Benefit 4:  Gold standard restricts commercial banks and government.  If banks create too 
much credit, the credit expands the money supply, leading to inflation in the long run.  People 
would convert their currency into gold, restricting credit expansion and  hence reduci ng inflation.  
Moreover, government could print money to finance budget deficits, but this causes  inflation. 
Then  the public counteracts the inflation by converting money into gold (Gold Standard, p. xi).  
Gold standard , unfortunately, can export a country’s  recession  to other c ountries . However , 
all exchange rate regimes share  this problem. For example, the United States and Japan engage 
in trade, and both use the gold standard. We outline the s teps for a country to export a  recession : 
 
 If the United States enters a recession, the U.S. consumers reduce their demand for imports  
or Japanese products. If the U.S. exports remain the same  while  imports fall, the U.S. 
experiences a trade surplus, leading to a gold  inflow from the Japan to the United States . 
 Japan e xports fall  to the United States because lo wer demand causes the export industries 
to contract, and they lay off workers. Furthermore, the Japanese central bank must reduce 
its money supply  because  it had shipped  gold to the United States. Consequently, th e 
unemployed workers buy fewer  goods  because  they earn  lower incomes and deflation 
causes Japanese products  to become cheaper.  Furthermore, contractionary monetary policy 
would raise interest rates that reduce investment. Falling investment would contract the 
economy further.  
 All exchange rate regimes allow one country to export a recession to another country. 
Nevertheless, a flexible exchange rate allows a country to manipulate the excha nge rate to 
reduce  a recession ’s impact . 
After World War II, 44 countr ies implemented a new international system,  the Bretton 
Woods System , where the delegate s met at a vacation resort, Bretton Woods, in New 
Hampshire . The Bretton Woods Sys tem establish ed fixed exchange rates  between  nations that  
lasted  between 1945 and 1971 . All countries except the United States fixed their exchange rates 
to the U.S. dollar.  Then the United States government established the official exchange rate of 
$35 for 1 ounce of gold because the United States held much of the world’s gold supply. The 
U.S. government accumulated  gold from the sale of supplies and weapons to Europe for both 
World Wars . However, the gold-dollar exchange rate applied to foreign governments because  
U.S. citizens  could not legally own  gold between 1933 and 1974 . Consequently , the Bretton 
Wood s System transformed  the U.S. dollar into the international reserve currency   
The Bretton Woods system was more flexible than the gold standard  because  countr ies 
could adjust their currency exchange  rates relative to the U.S. dollar.  Consequently, countries 
used a system resembling a gold standard, but a government can  intervene with its  exchange rate  
to correct a balance -of-payments deficit . Then U.S. President, Richard Nixon, ended the Bretton 
Woods System on August 15, 1971 because the United States experienced trade deficits that 
would lead to a gold outflow.  
The Bretton Woods system created two institutions:  International Bank of Reconstruction 
and Development, or simply  World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . World Bank  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
186 
 grants long -term loans to developing countries.  They use the loans  for economic develo pment 
and build a country’s infrastructure, such as highways, bridges, power plants, and water supply 
systems.  World Bank sells bonds in th e international markets  to raise  funds for its projects.   
Countries created the International Monetary Fund  (IMF)  to be the lender of the last 
resort. The IMF grants loans to countries that experience balance -of-payment deficits. 
Consequently, the IMF is similar to a central bank because  a central bank can grant emergency 
loans to its banks during a financial panic or crisis. Thus, the IMF should  stabilize  international 
payments an d promote international trade. Moreover, the IMF  collects and standardizes 
international economi c data. The I MF has 181 members  and opens membership  to any 
independent nations. If a country wants to join t he IMF, then this country  contribute s capital 
based upon a formula. A country pays one -fourth of the capi tal in gold and three -fourths in that 
country’s own cu rrency. IMF relaxed it gold requirement, and countries can pay using strong 
currencies such as  euros, pound s sterling, Special Drawing Rights, U.S. dollar s, or  yens. 
Consequently,  the IMF gains financial capital  because  the IMF possesses  gold and a pool of  
foreign currencies that it can lend to countries.  
The IMF helps countries that are  experiencing balance -of-payment s deficits. For examp le, 
Britain has a balance -of-payments deficit, and it borrows from the IMF. The British government 
needs U.S. dollars, s o the British government or central bank gives pounds and receives dollars 
from  the IMF to finance its balance -of-payments deficit. Thus, the U.S. dollars decrease  while  
British pounds increase in the IMF’s currency pool. When Britain repays  the loan with interest, 
it repays in a currency that is acceptable to IMF, and the n the  IMF returns the British pounds.  
The IMF created Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)  in 1969  because  IMF officials believed a 
gold and reserve asset  shortage  would cause an international cr isis. Each member country of the 
IMF receives a proportion of new  SDRs.  Between 1968 and 1971, the IMF created $10 billion 
worth of SDRs.  By 2010, the IMF has issue d 204 billion of SDRs,  approximately worth $308 
billio n. When a countr y experiences  a balance -of-payments  deficit, it can use its SDRs as money 
to obtain foreign currencies from the IMF.   
Are SDRs money? Originally,  the IM F priced a SDR  based on gold’s weight . Then the IMF 
officials switched  the SDR’s value to a basket of strong currenci es, containing the euro, British 
pound, Japanese Yen, and U.S. dollar.  Consequently, the IMF defines the SDR as a “unit of 
account,”  which comprises one function of money , and it establishes exchange rate s with the 
four currencies. Moreover, the countries can use SDRs to obtain foreig n currencies from the 
IMF that suggests the SDR is  money. However, the IMF considers SDRs to be a credit 
instrument. Many governments and international investors are worri ed about the depreciating  
U.S. dol lar and the  depreciati ng euro. Some people  suggest ed the SDR should become the new 
international currency. Thus, international trade would not collapse  if the United States or 
European enters a severe economic depression.  
The U.S. Treasury accepts the new  SDRs on behalf of the United States. Then it issues 
certifica tes that are claims to the SDRs  and sells these certificates to the Feder al Reserve. 
Consequently, SDR certificates become assets to the Federal Reserve.  
Although the countries abandoned the Bretton Woods system in 1 971, the World Bank and 
IMF still live . Subsequently, go vernments use a  variety controls, measures, and standards for  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
187 
 their country's currency . Governments specify the rules and limits how people and businesses 
can exchange  its currency for other currencie s. Furthermore, governments impose controls on 
imports, exports,  international investment , and foreign ownership of real estate , indirectly 
influencing  its currency exchange rates . 
Government  could implement  a flexible ex change rate system, allowing  the supply and 
demand in the foreign -exchange markets to determine its currency exchange rate . Investors refer 
to this as a free float  or clean float  because, government does not interfere  with its exchange 
rates. Although Canada, Eurozone, Japan, South K orea, and United States allow their  exchange 
rates to change, these countries  occasionally intervene with their  exchange rate s. Unfortunately, 
fluctuating exchange rates could hinder international trade and investment.  
Most countries use a managed float , where a government allows supply and demand to 
determine its currency’s exchange rate, but it intervenes to achieve economic policy goals. Of 
course, if investors are pessimistic about a government’s ability to manage its exchange rate , 
they call this  dirty  float . Usually, a government maintains either a too strong or a too  weak  
currency relative to the other currencies. Unfortunately, government int ervention could lead to 
depreciation . For example, if investors believe a country's currency will depreciate, then they  
either cash out of that currency or buy derivative contracts. Consequently, investor s can 
overwhelm a government, forcing it to devalue its currency . Then investors’ expectations turn 
into a self -fulfilling prophecy.  
Some governments use a pegged  exchange r ate, where the government fixes  its currency 
exchange rate to a strong currency, such as  the U.S. dollar or euro. For example, the United 
Arab Emirates  (UAE)  set its exchange  rate to one U.S. dollar to equal three UA E dirhams before 
2008 . Once the 2008 Financial Crisis st ruck the world, UAE devalued its currency to one U.S. 
dollar to 3.67 dirhams. Other countries like Bahamas,  Barbados , and Hong Kong  peg their 
currencies to the U.S. dollar  while  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria fix their  currency to 
the euro. Unfortunately, a government must  intervene in the currency  market to maintain its  
exchange rate . Countries like Uzbekistan and some African countries maintain exchang e rates 
that are too strong, but  their central banks rapidly expand the money supplies, creating inflation. 
Inflation can weaken a currency. Consequently, black markets form for their currencies  because 
the b lack market price reflects the tru e market value. A  government  can use a pegged exchange 
rate to keep inflation in check  if its central bank helps government finance its budget by 
expanding its money supply . 
Several  countries use  dollarization , where  a country uses the U.S. dollar  or euro as its  own 
currency . For instance, El Salvador , Ecuador, and Panama u se the U.S. dollars as their own 
currency . Further more, U.S. territories, such as  Guam, Marshall Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, 
and Puerto Rico  also use U.S. dollars . A territory is a country that was not admitted as a state to 
the Uni ted States. Other countries,  Kosov o and Montenegro , use the euro as their currency  even 
though they are not European Union members . Consequently, dollarization allows a country to 
integrate  its economy with United States  or the Eurozone by tying its  inflation rate to that 
country. Dollariz ation  also re move s the exchange rate risk , but t hat country loses control over 
monetary policy . Its central bank  cannot co llect revenue from seigniorage , when a government 
earns  a profit  from printing money . For example, the Federal Reserve pays approximat ely 14 Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
188 
 cents ($0.14) to manufacture  a one -hundred dollar bill. Thus, the Federal Reserve earns $9 9.86, 
when this bill enters circulation. Unfortunately, dollarization severely limits a central bank’s 
power.  
Countries using the current  exchange rate regime s encourage world -wide inflation.  For 
example, if a country’s currency is depreciating from  a rapid expanding  money supply, then 
another country could counteract its currency  appreciation by  rapidly expanding its money 
supply . Consequently , these countrie s would maintain stable exchange rates,  although these 
countries are afflicted with high inflation rates  (Gold Standard, p. xii).  
Financing Balance -of-Payments Deficits  and Surpluses  
Exchange rate regime determines which strategies a country must undertake to finance a 
balance -of-payments deficit  or surplus . Surpluses are easier to finance than the deficits . Some 
call a “deficit with tears ” because a central bank or government must use its resources to finance 
it. On the other hand, a balance -of-payments sur plus allows a government or central bank to 
accumulate foreign assets.  
Fixed rate r egime is the most difficult to maintain  because  a government must maintain a 
balance -of-payments (BOP)  deficit or surplus close to zero . Unfortunately, this regime weakens 
a central bank’s  power for monetary policy . For instanc e, if the central bank expands  the money 
supply, then the country’s interest rate falls. Next, the international investors cash out of the 
country  because  they invest in other countries with higher inte rest rates. Consequently, the 
demand for that country’s currency weakens and depreciates. For the government or central 
bank to maintain the fixed exchange rate, it must enter the international market a nd buy its 
currency, causing  its currency to appreciat e. Unfortunately, a c entral bank must focus on its 
exchange rate , reducing its  focus on other goals . 
A countr y with a fixed exchange rate can use  two strategies:  
Strategy 1: If a country has a balance -of-payments  deficit, it has an e xcess supply of 
currency on the foreign exchange markets . Thus, a  central bank  buys its currency  using official 
settlements reserves, such as foreign currencies, gold, SDRs,  or a loan from the IMF . As a 
country removes its currency from the international m arkets, its balance -of-payments deficit 
falls. If the central bank  has no reser ve assets, then  it must  devalue its currency , or a black 
market could form.  
Strategy 2: If a country experiences a balance -of-payments  surplus, subsequently, that 
country has a shortage of currency on the foreign exchange markets . A central bank can easily 
finance a surplus  because  it sells its currency to buy foreign currencies , accumulating official 
reserves . 
Floating exchange  rate regime is the easiest to maintain  because  a government does not 
intervene with its currency exchange rate. Government  or central bank al lows the exchange rate  
to correct any surpl uses or deficits. I f a country experiences a balance -of-payment deficit , then 
its currency tends to  depreciate  over time, c ausing  exports  to increase while  imports decline.  On 
the other hand, a  balance -of-payment surplus doe s the exact opposite.  
A country  could experience  the J-curve Effect , when  the trade deficit becomes  worse  
temporarily  as its currency depreciates  as shown in Figure 1. For example, a country allows its Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
189 
 currency to depreciate starting at time period t 1. Unfortunately, the trade deficit initially worse ns 
before improving . Time span ranges from three to six months , denoted as t 1 and t 2 on the graph.  
If a country  experiences a balance -of-payment surplus , then it  allows its currency to 
appreciate. Consequently, its exports decr ease while its imports increase  while  the balance -of-
payments approaches  zero.  
 
 
Figure 1. The J -curve E ffect  
 
Most countries use a  managed float , where a  government or central bank varies the interest 
rate to intervene in the foreign exchange market. For instance, a country is experiencing a 
balance -of-payments deficit. Consequently, the central bank contracts the money supply, 
boost ing the interest rate. Next, the international investors invest in a country,  earning the 
greater interest rate and  causing t he financial account to rise  until the balance of payments 
equals zero again.  
A central bank or government can finance a b alance -of-payments surplus  easily under a 
managed float system. Central bank e xpands the money supply, lowering  the interest rates . 
Hence, t he international investors reduce their investments in the country  because  they can earn 
higher returns elsewhere. Consequently, the financial account falls until the balance -of-
paym ents surplus approaches  zero.  
A country can have difficulties financing a  balance-of-payments deficit  for all exchange 
rate regimes . Consequently, a  government might  impose foreign -exchange rate controls to 
correct t he imbalance. A government can alter  the rules and regulati ons, especially for 
foreigners such as prohibit ing the foreigners from transferring  their money out of the country. A 
government can impose  special taxes and fees on interest earnings and dividends . Then 
government collects  revenue, instead of  money flowing out of the country.  
A country could experience  capital f light , when the foreign investors become spooked , and 
they quickly withdraw investments from a country . They believe they will  lose their investments 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
190 
 and t hey rapidly cash out , causing a massive financial account outflow . A capital flight is similar 
to a bank run, where all the depositors appear  at their bank to withdraw  mone y from  their 
accounts , but capital flight is a bank run on a whole nation . Unfortunately, capital flight causes 
problems for a government  because  it could depreciate a currency rapidly . For example, the 
Asian Financial Crisis started in Thailand in 1997. T he Thai government no longer could 
support the fixed exchange for the baht , and it devalued the baht . International investors 
panicked and quickly withdrew their investments, sparking a crisis. Then the crisis sparked  a 
contagion . Investors questioned their investments in other countries,  spreading  the crisis  to 
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, South Korea , and the Philippines  as massive  capital  
flows  left the countries . Other countries  devastated by capital flight included  Mexico in 1994 -
1995, and  Russia  in 1998.  
Causes of c apital flight vary. Usually an  event or government policy triggers the capital 
outflow . For example, France imposed a ne w tax on the wealthy in 2006, causing  the wealthy to 
transfer their investments out of  France. Although the French government collected $2.6 billion 
per year  in new taxes , it lost more than $125 billion in capital  as the wealthy avoided the tax . 
Illustrating another example , the Thai government  devalued the baht that harmed  investments 
denominated in bahts. Thus , international investors panicked, started capital outflows from 
Thailand that sparked  the Asian Financial Crisis . Finally, a governme nt nationalizing industries 
could  trigger capital flight  as investors  worry about governments seizing their investments .  
International investors use several  methods to cash out investments from a foreign country , 
which include : 
 
 International investors transfer their cash out of the country via bank transfers. Once the 
capital outflow becomes severe, then government may impose capital controls on the banks 
to limit  outflows.  
 Investors could smuggle currency out of the country. Then  they deposit it into b anks in 
their home country or to  an off shore account. A government can  tighten security at airports 
and seaports , and customs can  seize currency  if they catch any travel er who carries  too 
much  cash. 
 Investor s could convert their curr ency to precious metals, such as gold, silver, or platinum. 
Then they smuggle the metals outside of the country.  
 Investor s could utilize  money laundering  that uses many techniques to structure cash 
deposits into the banking system , hiding the investor s’ activities.  
 Investor s could utilize  false invoices  if they deal with an importer. For example, an 
investor could falsi fy invoices that over price imported items, or underprice  the exported 
items. Thus, they transfer more money out of the country by paying mo re for imports  and 
receiving  less money from selling exports . Money, Banking, and International Finance

 Hegemony  
A nation can exert relational and/or structural power over other nations. Relational power  is 
one nation can  force  another nation to do so mething or not do it . Many sports, like foot ball, 
soccer, or chess , are forms of relational power. For countries,  a nation’s military strength  
determines its relational power . On the other hand, Structural power  represents  a nation’s 
ability  to shape and influence the intern ational institutions. All nations, political institutions, 
businesses, and people operate under the international  institutions. Some nations possess  
structural  power to affect the international institution s and change the rules in its favor.  
The United Sta tes possesses  both relational and structural powers. It gained both powers 
after World War II. The United Stat es leads countries  in technology, has the world’s largest 
economy , and possesses a strong military. Furthermore, the U.S. has the structural power  to 
influence the World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund. Of course, the United States 
helpe d create these institutions  and became  a large financial contributor.  
A hegemony exceeds  relational and structural powers. A hegemo ny is one country 
dominat es other countries in international commerce. Hegemony is the richest and most 
powerful nation that  establish es the institutions of  international trade. Hegemony is a  leader in 
industrial and agricultural production, has a strong financial system, and domi nates international 
trade. Hence, the hegemony becomes a source of wealth, power, and economic growth. Modern 
world has seen three modern hegemonies. The United Prov inces (or Holland) ruled international 
trade in the 18th century; Great Britain ruled the w orld during the 19th century, and the United 
States has dominated the world after World War II.  
A hegemony is critical for free trade because international markets and institutions are 
public goods. Hegemony fosters free trade, e nsures peace and security b y protect ing trade  from 
pirates and rogue nations , balance s nations’  powers, creates the system  of international 
payments or the money system , and establishes the international institution s. These public goods 
are expensive  to provide, and many nations can  free ride on the international system without 
contributing to it. A free rider is a country that opens itself to international trade and benefits  
from trade without paying for t he public goods that establish  and maintain  free trade.  
A hegemony provides the int ernational public goods, even supporting the free riders  
because t he benefits  outwe igh the costs. When a hegemony rises, the world economy grow s and 
prosper s. Thus, th e markets c reate wealth for all participating  nations. For example, the United 
States supports a system of free trade. After World War II, the U.S. became  the largest industrial 
producer  because  the European factories lay in ruins. Then the United States greatly ben efited 
from international trade  after creating  the Bretton Woods System.  The U.S. experienced a strong 
world demand for goods produced in its manufacturing industries d uring the 1950s and 1960s,  
leading to goods wages with a high living standard.   
Costs of a hegemony, unfortunately, rise over time, weakening the hegemony's wealth and 
power. If the hegemony fails, then the public goods for international trade disappear , causing 
world trade to break down. Then  the world’s economy stagnates and begins  declining. An 
interesting twist for  a hegemony is a rich and powerful nation gai ns control after a large war. Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
192 
 Over time,  the hegemony begins declining , and harmonious relationships break down. Then a 
war follows , and, in the aftermath, a new hegemony rise s. 
Some people argue the  United States grew into a selfish hegemony. The U.S. dol lar became  
the international currency that  the U. S. government abuses. The U.S. government accumulated  a 
large public debt, and the U.S. economy suffers from sizeable trade deficits , caus ing an outflow 
of U.S. dollars into the international markets. Some foreigners and central banks hold onto to 
these dollars. For example, the U.S. buys petroleum from Russia. As  Russia sen ds oil to the 
U.S., the  Russians retain  the U.S. dollars , which are  pieces of paper. Furthermore, many 
foreigners save the ir earnings in U.S. dollars while  others invest in the U.S. government’s debt. 
Again, they are buying U.S. Treasury Securities, which are pieces of paper. For now, these 
pieces of paper have value , but som e question whether the U.S. government can  finance the dual 
deficits  over a long time period . If the U.S. dollar collapses in value, then foreigners will possess 
worthless pieces of paper. C onsequently, c ountries  that are not hegemonies cannot accumulate  a 
large government debt by getting foreigners to invest in it . 
As t he United States  grew into  a hegemony, it cannot have a current account surplus  
because  the surplus  could devastate the world’s economy. International businesses, banks, and 
governments use U.S. dollars to settle international payments. If the U.S. current account 
approached  zero, then a liquidity crisis w ould strike the world  because  people, businesses, and 
the government have no means to settle international payments.  A hegemony’s trade def icits 
become a  money source  for the world’s economy.

 16. The Foreign -Currency Exchange Rate  Markets  
Many countries across the world use a f lexible exchange rate regime. Consequently, th is 
chapter builds upon a market's currency exchange rates, and explains how investors can 
calculate a cross exchange rate for two countries that rarely engage in trade. Moreover, investors 
can profit from arbitrage, when currency exchange rates differ betw een two or more markets. 
Then, students learn the supply and demand analysis to predict changes  in a currency’ s 
exchange rate because a country’s income, inflation, interest rates, etc. influence exchange rates. 
Finally, we expand the supply  and demand ana lysis to include a  pegged exchange rate and  
explain  how a central bank devaluing its currency  can trigger capital flight and a financial crisis.  
Foreign Exchange Rates  
Foreign -currency exchange market  is traders exchange  currency of one country  for 
another  country’s currency. Consequently, five parties need foreign currency. First, international 
banks specialize in foreign currencies. They transfer billions in foreign currencies with other 
banks. Second, any person or business engaged in international trade  and commerce, esp ecially  
imports and exports. Third, international travelers need foreign currency to pay for food, 
lodging, and entertainment in a foreign country. Fourth, central banks and governments use a 
cache of foreign currencies to finance balance -of-payments deficits or to manipulate their 
exchange rate. Finally, international investors invest in for eign countries, seeking greater profits  
in foreign countries .  
Some international investors use hedging , where they invest in several  countries to red uce 
their risk, while other investors use speculation , where they buy currency for a low price and 
sell for a high price. Speculation is  a form of gambling  because  speculators gamble on future 
prices . Furthermore, investors could use arbitrage . Investors s ee a price difference of the same 
currency in two separate markets; thus, they  buy currency for a low price and sell  it for a higher 
price  in the other market , reducing  the price difference  to zero between th e markets.  
Foreign exchange market is the largest market in the world , and traders exchanged nearly  
$3.2 trillio n daily in 2007. M ost transactions are electronic transfers  between international 
banks , whereas tr ansactions occur 24  hours per day, 7 days per week. Foreign exchange market 
has retail and wholesale  markets.  Retail market is a small market, where agents  buy and sell 
foreign currencies , usually at booths at shopping malls, airports, and train and bus stations . 
Retailers display two exchange rates: Selling and  buying price. Retailer always sells currency 
for a higher price than the buying price.  Hence, t he price spread reflects  the retailers’ 
commission . On the other hand, t he whol esale market comprises of  a network of about 2,000 
banks and brokerage firms.  They buy and sell currencies with each other or  with large 
corporations.  Wholesale market uses an international clearing system where they exchange 
electronic deposits.  International clearing system is similar to a clearinghouse for checks.  
Supply and demand analysis for foreign currencies assumes no government interference and 
flexible exchange rates.  For example, one U.S. dollar equals 3.0 Malaysian ringgit s (or $1 = 3 Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
195 
 rm). How much would  a one -liter of Coca -Cola  costs in doll ars if Coca -Cola  costs 1.5 rm ? Just 
multiply the ringgit price by the ratio ($1 / 3 rm ) in Equation 1,  which eq uals $0.50 .

Investors and bankers  can calculate an exchange rate for currencies that investors  rarely 
trade. They calculate the cross rate  to determine  the exchange rate for these currencies . For 
example, the Mexican peso  to U.S. dollar exchange rate is well established, while the peso -euro 
exchange rate is not. Since euros and U.S. dollars are widely traded, we can calculate the peso -
euro ex change rate. If the peso -U.S. dollar exchange rate equals  12.9 pesos  per $1, and the euro -
U.S. dollar is € 0.77 per $1, subsequently, we calculate the peso -euro exchange rate  in Equation 
2 as 16.8 per €. We use a trick – we retain the currency units; thus,  the correct calculation has 
one of the currency units drop out , which is U.S. dollars in this case .

Using  another example , a cross rate is the exchange rate between the Myanmar  kyat and 
U.S. dollar. If one Malaysian ringgit equals 282.6 Myanmar kyat s, then we use the U.S. dollar -
exchange rate to calculate the rarely traded exchanged rate. Consequently,  we calculate  the U.S. 
dollar -kyat exchange rate  in Equation 3 as 847.8 kyats per $1 .

Currency exchange rates are continually fluctuating , and a banker or investor can profit 
from  price differences , called intermarket arbitrage . For example, a trader at Citibank has 
$100,000  and observes the follo wing banks’  exchange rates. We denote the British pound  by the 
symbol £.  
 
Citibank    $1.54 / 1 £  
 
Credit Suisse    € 1.6 / 1 £ 
 
Deutsche Bank   $0.97 / 1 € 
 
First, we c alculate the cross rate  between Citibank and Credit Suisse  in Equation 4 , which 
equals $0.9625 per one euro. Then we compare this exchange rate to Deutsche Bank, equaling  
$0.97 per one euro. Since the exchange rates differ , then arbitrage exists , and we can profit from Kenneth R. Szulczyk

converts money from one currency to another, he simultaneously creates demand and supplies 
for currencies. Over time, the price differences between exchange rat es disappear.  In the modern 
age, the international banks use computers to spot differences in exchange rates  and quickly 
execute transactions to profit from arbitrage.

Demand and Supply for Foreign Currencies  
Demand function  for a currency originates from international trade between Malaysia and 
the United States . Price for Malaysian ringgits  is the exchange rate of U.S. dollars per one 
ringgit . We always show the currency price in the denominator of the currency exch ange  rate 
because  a price decrease reflects  a currency  depreciating  while a price increase is a n 
appreciating  currency . Demand for ringgits  originates from U.S. consumers who want to impor t 
goods and services from Malaysian  companies.  Thus, U.S. consumers need ringgits to pay for 
the Malay sian goods.  As U.S. consumers convert dollars into ringgits, the demand for ringgits  
simultaneously creates a supply of U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market.

We show the e xchange rates for Points A and B  in Equations 8 . We write the currency price  
first while the standard exchange ratio is in brackets.  As we move from Point A to Point B, the 
Malaysian ri nggits depreciate  while  the U.S. dollar appreciates.

Point B: $0.25 per 1 ringgit   or [$1 = 4.0 rm ] 
 
Supply function for ringgits  originates from the Malaysian  consumers who buy U.S. 
products.  U.S. firms sell products and services to Malaysian  consumers, which are U.S. exports.  
The Malaysian  consumers need U.S. dollars to pay for it.  Consequently, they  have a dema nd for 
dollars, converting ringgits  to U.S. dollars supply  ringgits  on the exchange  market.  Demand for 
ringgits  in one market simultaneously creates a supply of U.S. dollars in another market, and 
vice-versa.  
We show the s upply function for Malaysian ringgits  in Figure 2 . As we move  from Point A 
to Point B , the ringgit exchange rate  rises. Consequently, the ringgit  appreciated while the U.S. 
dollar depreciated.  Price of U.S. g oods became cheaper while Malaysian  goods become more 
expensive.  The U.S. imports decrease while U.S. exports increase.  Malaysia  experiences the 
opposite pattern. It s imports rise while its exports fall.

Exchange rate fluctuations alter prices of all goods, services, and assets that businesses, 
people, and government trade on the international markets. Analysts use appreciation and 
depre ciation to compare two currencies. As one currency appreciates, the other must depreciate  
because  these terms are relative  to one another . When analysts refer to a weak or strong U.S. 
dollar, analysts compare the U.S. dollar  to a basket of currencies from industrialized countries. 
A weak U.S. dollar means the value of the dollar decreased relative to a basket of other 
currencies, such as the British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. A strong U.S. dollar is the 
opposite.  
Factors that Shift Demand and Supply Fun ctions  
Many factors influence supply and demand functions for foreign exchange rates.  Several 
factors include  interest rates, inflation, income, and actions by central banks.  For instance, 
interest rates affect investment and financial capital inflows and outflows for a country, while 
inflation affects a country’s prices and hence its trade flows.  Inflation is  a continual increase of 
prices.  Furthermore, a  growing economy creates higher inco mes, and greater  demands for 
normal goods , which are most products . Finally, central banks could influence exchange rates 
by buying and selling currencies.  
Real interest rate affects the currency exchange rates. Real interest rate m eans economists 
subtracted the country’s inflation rate from the  nominal inter est rate . For  example, we show the 
Malaysian ringgit exchange market  in Figure 4, and the original market price and quantity are 
P* and Q*. If Malaysia has a greater real interest rate  than the United States, then U.S. investors 
increase their demand for ring gits; they  want to earn the great er interest rate. Demand for 
ringgits rises  and shifts right ward . Furthermore, Malaysian citizens invest more within their 
country, decreasing the supply of ringgits on the international markets. When the supply and 
demand both shift , either the market quantity or price becomes indeterminate. In this case, 
market price increases  while  market quantity becomes  indeterminate. Consequently, the U.S. 
dollar depreciates  while  the ringgit appreciates.  
We can use a trick to determine which va riable becomes indeterminate. First, shift the 
demand function. Then draw three supply function shifts, where the first one shifts a little, the 
second shifts a little more, and the third  shifts a lot. Consequently, o ne variable always moves in 
one directi on while the other can increase and decrease, making it indeterminate.  
Inflation rates of countries could impact the foreign exchange market. For exa mple, Mexico 
experiences a greater inflation  than the United States. We depict t he U.S. dollar exchange 
market in Figure 5. Market price and quantity are P* and Q*. Higher inflation rate causes the 
prices of Mexican goods to become expensive  while  prices for U.S. goods become relatively 
cheaper. Therefore, Mexicans increase their demand for U.S. goods, increasi ng the demand for 
U.S. dollars. On the other side of the border, the U.S. citizens buy more domestic goods, 
decreasing their demand for Mexican goods. Hence, the supply for U.S. dollars decreases and 
shifts left ward . Consequently, the U.S. dollar appreciat es while  the peso depreciates. In this 
case, the equilibr ium quantity for U.S. dollars becomes  indeterminate.

A central bank can increase or decrease the supply of its currency on the foreign exchange 
markets. For example, we show the U.S. dollar exchange market in Figure 6. Market price is P* 
while Q* represents market quantity . The Federal Reserve System, the U. S. central bank, 
increases the U.S. dollars on the international exchange market. Consequently, the supply

 function increases, shifting rightward, decreasing the market price. Thus, the U.S. dollar 
depreciates while Malaysian ringgit appreciates.

A central bank holds foreign currencies. If a central bank wants to strengthen its currenc y, it 
must buy its currency using a foreign currency. Consequently, a central bank’s cache of foreign 
currencies would decrease. If a central ba nk weaken s its currency, subsequently, it buys foreign 
currencies using its own currency. Hence, a central bank accumulates more foreign currencies.  
The key is scarcity. If the exchange market has little of a country’s currency, then the currency 
becomes more scarce. Consequently, investors, central banks, and people value it more.  
If investors believe a currency wi ll depreciate, then their beliefs become self -fulfilling 
prophecies. For example,  we depict  the international currency market for U.S. dollars in Figure 
7. Unfortunately, the investors believe the U.S. dollar will depreciate. Consequently, the 
investors re duce the ir demand for U.S. dollars and shift  the demand  leftward , decreasing  the 
exchange rate. Th us, th e U.S. dollar depreciates  while  the euro appreciates. I nvestors’  beliefs 
turned into reality. In a worst -case scenario, a depreciating currency triggers a capital flight. 
International investors withdraw their investments  from a foreign country, collapsing its 
currency  and creating a severe financial crisis for the cou ntry. 
Supply and demand analysis could be ambiguous  in some cases. F or example, Malaysia ’s 
GDP grows faster than U.S. GDP . Malaysian citizens experience growing incomes and would 
increase their demand for all products, including imports. Thus, Malaysian ci tizens increase 
their demand for U.S. dollars, increasing the supply of ringgits on th e currency exchange 
market. U.S. dollar appreciates while the ringgit depreciates. A rapidly growing country 
experiences greater inflation, which causes its currency to d epreciate. However, a prospering 
country tends to have higher interest rates, which has the opposite effect on the market.

In the real world, many factors influence exchange rates. A country could impose trade 
barriers like tariffs and quotas. A tariff is a tax on imports, while a quota limits the quantity of  
imports. Both trade barriers reduce a country’s imports . Furthermore, some countries could 
impose strict regulations. Extensive regulations and taxes reduce trade and financial capital 
flows. Finally, investors’ e xpectations and uncertainty can impact  trade flows.  
Fixed Exchange Rates  
Central banks in several countries established a fixed exchange rate  with a strong currency, 
such as the U.S. dollar or euro. A fi xed exchange rate is  a pegged exchange rate . Usually a 
government or central bank established a currency board that maintains the exchange rate. For 
example, Argentina, Bermuda, and Hong Kong pegged their  currencies to the U.S. dollar while 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, and Estonia fixed their currencies to the euro. Furthermore, a 
central bank must hold  a cache of currency reserves  to buy or sell cu rrencies to balance its 
currency flows that maintain the fixed exchange rate.  
We expand the s upply  and demand analysis  to include a fixed exchange. A central bank 
does not specify an exact price, but it allows its currency to fluctuate within a band , depicted in 
Figure 8. Consequently, a central bank allows the market to change the ex change rate  within the 
band. If the exchange rate falls outside of the band, then  the central bank must intervene  in the 
currency market to return  the exchange rate back w ithin the band.  Thus, a central bank requires 
a cache of currency reserves.  
The Un ited Arab Emirates (UAE)  pegged i ts currency exchange rate to  U.S. dollar s, where 
one U.S. dollar  equals three dirhams. As an illustration , the international investors reduce  their 
demand for the dirhams, decreasing the exchange rate  below the band. Consequently, the UAE 
central bank must buy dirhams from the currency exchange market. It exchanges U.S. dolla rs or 
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
203 
 euros for dirhams, decreasing the supply function  and shift ing it leftward . Thus, th e exchang e 
rate returns within the band.

Figure  9. A central bank intervenes in the currency market  
 
Two important terms are associated with a pegged exchange rate. If a central bank allows 
its currency to appreciate permanently out side the band, then we call it  a revaluation . A central 
bank may  not strengthen its currency too often  because  the central bank accumulates capital 
from the surplus inflow. On the other hand, if the central bank allows the currency to depreciate 
Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
204 
 permanently outside  the band, subsequently, we call it a devaluation . A co untry experiences a 
continuous outflow of capital, and the central bank does n ot have the reserves to buy  its 
currency from the currency exchange markets. Thus, this country could devalue its currency to 
reduce its balance -of-payments deficit.   
Devaluation  can trigger capital flight  and a severe financial crisis. Moreover, devaluation 
lessens the investors’  faith in a government's leaders. For example, international investment 
fund managers invested approximately $45 billion in Mexico to earn the higher int erest rate 
before 1994. Influx of foreign capital appreciated the Mexican peso , which reduced exports and 
boosted imports. Furthermore, Mexicans reduced their savings an d increased their consumption. 
Unfortunately, t he Mexican government could not  finance the large trade deficits  as it depleted 
its reserve funds. Then Mexico devalued the peso on December 20, 1994, triggering capital 
flight. International investors cashed in  their Mexican stocks and bonds  and began massive 
capital withdrawals from Mexico. Peso depreciated at least 40% by January 1995. 
Unfortunately, capital flight can lead to a co ntagion, when investors  question their investments 
in other countries, spreading the crisis. The Bank of International Settlements and International 
Monetary Fund ( IMF) bailed out Mexico with a $53 billion package, which stabilized the 
world's financial markets.  
For another example , the investors were attracted to the Asian countries  because  their 
economies grew rapidly , and they could earn high  investment  returns . The T hai government 
pegged the baht to the U.S. dollar. Then t he Thai government devalue d the baht on July 2, 1997. 
Next, t he investors  panicked and  suddenly withdrew their investments from Thailand . 
Subsequently, the crisis became a contagion, spread ing to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
and South Korea  as investors qu estioned their investment in those countries . Crisis continued to 
spread until  it reached Russia and Brazil . Unfortunately, a ll the countries experienced large 
devaluations  of their curr encies . Companies and corporations that accepted loans  denominated 
in foreign currencies  quickly defaulted. Once their home currency began depreciating , they 
could not afford to repay their f oreign debt.  
The IMF bailed out Indonesia, South Korea, and Thail and. As part of loan conditions, the 
countries imposed austerity. Austerity  is the government must reduce  government spending 
and/or raise taxes. The IMF also wanted the countries to  raise the interest rates  to stop capital 
flight . International investors are attracted to high interest rates. Unfortunately, Thailand and 
Indonesia experienced declines of 20% or more of their industrial production . Austerity in this 
case worsens their economies . According to Keynesian eco nomics, during  a downturn in an  
economy, a government must increase spending and/or reduce taxes to boost the  economy. 
Unfortunately, a usterity does  the opposite, which slows down the economy. Furthermore, for a 
country to boost its interest rates, a central bank must r educe the money supply, which again, 
slows down the economy , increasing the severity of the crisis . 
The Rule of Incompatible Trinity  states  a central bank can only control two out of the three  
variables : Fixed exchange r ate, free international flow of capi tal, and i ndependent monetary 
policy . For example, Hong Kong allows th e free flow of capital and pegs  the exchange rate to 
the U.S. dollar. Thus, it cannot support an independent monetary policy  because  the central bank 
must maintain the fixed exchange rat e. On the other hand, China and India impose capital Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
205 
 controls that  prevent investors withdrawing  from their economies. Consequently, both countries 
could impose a fixed exchange rate while the central bank can pursue an  independent monetary 
policy.

 17. Internationa l Parity Conditions  
Supply and demand analysis  allow s investors and economists to predict directional changes 
in a country's exchange rate. U nfortunately, the analysis can not answer quantitative changes. 
Consequently, t his chapter builds on  the supply and demand analysis and uses several th eories to 
predict quantitative changes in a country's  currency exchange rates . We will study the random 
walk, Purchasing Power Parity Theory, the Relative Purchasing Parity Theory, Interest Rate 
Parity Theorem, and Intern ational Fisher Effect. Furthermore, we study the Big Mac Index from 
the Economist  because  we can easily determine  whether  a country's  currency is over or 
undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar . Then we can predict whi ch direction the exchange rate 
should move over time.  
A Random Walk  
Currency market exchange rates could  exhibit a random walk  in the short run . Statisticians 
define a  random walk  whose current value is the previous period ’s value  plus a random 
disturbance. We show a random walk  in Equation 1.  Value of the spot exchange rate today is s t, 
which equals  yesterday's exchange rate , st-1, plus a random disturbance , et. We assume the 
random disturbance is  distributed  normally with a mean of zero with  a fixed standard deviation.  
For example, if the U.S. dollar -euro exchange rate equals  $1.3 per euro today, then we expect 
the exchange rate to be $1.3 per euro tomorrow plus a random fluctuation.  
 
ݏ௧=ݏ௧ିଵ+݁௧          (1) 
 
We show the m onthly U.S. do llar-euro exchange rate  in Figure 1. A random walk has an 
unique characteristic – the variable drifts in a pa rticular direction before changing  direction. If 
we take a first difference of the exchange rate, then the difference equals the random 
disturbance , illustrated in Equation 2. A first difference is we take today 's spot exchange rate 
and subtract  the previous period, which is  month ly for our case. We show the first difference  for 
the U.S dollar -euro exchange rate in Figure 2. L ine indicates the randomness of the exchange 
rate, but it is not completely  random . Moreover, statistical tests indicate  the U.S. dol lar-euro 
exchange rate is  almost  a random walk1. However,  these statistical tests are beyond the scope of 
this book.

Although currency exchange rates  exhibit a random  walk in the short run, economists and 
financial analysts use several  theories  to explain long -run movements.

while p 2 has a significant second lag. Unfortunately, this is not an anomaly. Many exchange rates exhibit thi s 
structure or exhibit a pure random  walk.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

 after adjusting for transportation costs. If a price difference e xists between two markets, then 
arbitrage is possible. Traders w ould buy products from the low -price market and sell products to 
the expensive market. Consequently, prices would converge to one price across all markets  as 
traders shifted supply from the lo w-price market to the high -price market . The high prices would 
fall while the low prices would rise over time.  
Price could differ between markets  because  the price difference reflects the transportation 
costs of shipping the product from one market to anot her. Nevertheless, the Purchasing Power 
Parity helps predict changes in exchange rates. For  example, the petroleum price equals  $90 per 
barrel in the United States and 850 pesos per barrel in Mexico. Implied exchange rate equals  one 
U.S. dollar equals 9.4 44 Mexican pesos (or pesos 850 ÷  $90). If the actual exchange rate is $1 = 
10 Mexican pesos, then the U.S. dollar is overvalued while the peso is undervalued. Actual 
exchange rate means a $90 per barrel of petroleum costs $85 per barrel in Mexico. 
Consequen tly, the traders could buy petroleum from Mexico, and they ship and sell petroleum to 
United States. Over tim e, the petroleum price rises  in Mexico  because  the traders reduced 
petroleum supply  while  the petroleum price decreases in United States  because  the petroleum 
supply increases. Eventually, arbitrage sto ps, when the prices converge  between both countries. 
Thus, Purchasing Power Parity estimates the  equilibrium exchange rate.  
Economists expand t he Purchasing Power P arity to  include many products in a society. 
Then economists  can compare a basket of goods of one country to another country. Consumer 
Price Index (CPI)  is a measure of a basket of goods in the United States . The CPI is an 
aggregate measure of prices , and economists use it to measure inflati on. The Absolute 
Purchasing Power Parity states the foreign exchange rate between two currencies is  the ratio of 
the two countries’  general  price levels. We define the notation  as: 
 
 Domestic price level for home country  equals  Pd. 
 Foreign price level  equal s Pf. 
 Spot exchange rate between countries  equals  S. 
We define the a bsolute PPP exchang e rate  by Equation 3 . 
 
df
PP=S            (3) 
 
For example, the CPI  for the United States equals  $755.3 while the CPI for Switzerland is 
1,241.2 francs. Thus, the absolute PPP predicts the exchange rate should be 1.64 francs per U.S. 
dollar  that we  calculate d in Equation 4 . 
 
1$francs 1.64=$755.3francs 1,241.2=PP=S
df      (4) Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
210 
  
If the spot exchange rate is 1.4  franc s per $1 , subsequently, traders  use arbitrage.  The CPI in 
the United States in francs is 1,057.42  (or $755.3 ×  1.4 francs per $1), which is smaller  than the 
CPI of Switzerland . Thus, t raders could profit by  purchasing a basket of good s from United 
States and sell ing it to Switzerland. Th us, th ey poten tially earn 1,241.20 – 1,057.42 = 183.78 
francs  per basket of goods .  
The Economist  publishes the Big Mac Index , based on the Purchasing Power Parity . 
McDo nald’s sells Big Macs in over 123  countries around the world. The Big Mac requires many  
ingredients like beef, buns, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and its special sauce. Furthermore , 
restaurants pay labor, retail space, and utilities like water, electricity, and natural gas. 
Consequently, a Big Mac's price correlates to the prices of its inputs , and the inputs represent  a 
variety of sect ors in a  country’s economy. Thus , the price of a Big Mac reflects a country’s PPP  
that we  show for 10  countries in Table 1. Finally, s ome analysts  designed  a Starbuck's Index  
similar ly to the Big Mac Index .

Malaysia for $2.33 and sell ing the hamburgers in the United St ates for $4.33. However, we must  
pay transportation costs and would experience  problems bringing numerous hamburgers through 
customs. Furthermo re, the Big Macs would not be fresh, and they would quickly spoil before 
they reach ed their destination.  
We can calculate the Big Mac  easily . For example, the  price of a Big Mac in Malaysia 
averaged 7.4 ringgits, which is the spot exchange rate multiplied by the  Big Mac’ s price in U.S. 
dollars (or 2.33 ×  3.17). If the costs are identical for both Malaysia and the United States , then 
the implied PPP value is the Big Mac’s  price in ringgits divided by the U.S. price, which equals Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
211 
 1.71 ringgits per U.S. dollar . Ho wever, the spot exchange rate equals  3.17 ringgits per U.S. 
dollar. Consequently, we estimate in Equation 5 that the  Malaysian ringgit is undervalue d to the 
U.S. dollar by approximately 46%. Dot above the Big Mac’ s price is the percentage change in 
price. Thus, analysts predict the ringgit will appreciate against the U.S. dollar over time.

In general, the PPP tends to hold in the long run, but not the short run  because  of the 
following reasons : 
 
 Countries impose  trade restrictions , such as tariffs and quotas. Moreover, many 
governments impose  trade restrictions on agricultural products. Countries use trade 
restriction s to protect their industries from  bacteria, viruses, insects, or a damaging plant s 
or species. F or example, United States,  Canada , and other countries ban  importing British 
beef to stop  the spread of hoof -mouth disease.  
 PPP emphasizes only price levels and exchange rates. The PPP does not include 
transportation costs  and transaction costs.  
 PPP will n ot hold if governments defin e different baskets for  their CPIs . Furthermore, 
some goods and services are not tradable, such as haircuts, medical services, and real 
estate.  For example, land and housing construction are expensive in developed countries, 
and relatively cheap in developing cou ntries. Unfortunately, high -priced  real estate hurls a 
great cost on businesses, when they rent, buy, or lease buildings and space. Subsequently, 
the businesses pas s the greater cost onto product s’ prices.  
The Relative Pu rchasing Power Parity Theory  is change s in products’ prices between 
countries vary the exchange rate. Furthermore, t he relative  PPP assumes the legal system  does 
not change , and we define the notation  as: 
 
 We define the c hange in the domestic exchange r ate as the foreign currency per one unit of 
domestic currency . 
 Foreign countr y’s inflation rate between now and time period T  is f.  
 Domestic  country’s  inflation rate between now  and T  is d.  
 ST and S 0 are the domestic exchange rates measured at times 0 and T. Thus, the exchange 
rate at Time 0 is

PP=S0 , and Time T is 

We use a linear app roximation to yield  Equation 7 . 
 
d fππe           (7) 
 
For example, t he annual U.S. inflation rate equals  3% while  Mexico's inflation rate is 25%. 
If we defined the domestic currency  as the peso, then the Mexican peso depreciates 
approximately 22% per year  while  the U.S. dollar appreciates roughly 22% per year. 
International investors prefer to hold currencies w ith low inflation rates  because  inflation erodes 
the value of currency. Thus, co nsumers and businesses would hold U.S. dollars  and would  sell 
their Mexican pesos. Consequ ently, the relative PPP usually  holds in the long run for  countries 
with large inflati on rate differences . Countries experienc ing high inflation  experience  
depreciating currencies . 
We modify the relative PPP to allow  analyst s to determine whether a country has a  
competitive export industry . We begin  with Equation 6  and rewrite it as Equation 8 .

Then we replace the one  with a k that represents  the competitiv e ratio. For example, 
Malaysia, experiences a 5% inflation rate , and we defined Malaysia as the domestic currency. 
Meanwhile,  the United States experiences a 2% inflation rate . If t he ringgit had depreciated  
against the  U.S. dollar by 1%, subsequently, we calculate d the competitiveness  ratio for 
Malaysia , where k = 0.981  in Equati on 10 . Consequently, our  calculation does not equal one, 
and the higher inf lation rate and the depreciating  currency keep  Malaysia n manufacturing  
competitive, boosting its export industries .

Rule for the competiti veness ratio is a k greater than one indicates a  country’ s export 
industries are not competitive, while a k less than one means the country ’s industries are

Quantity  Theory of Money  
We can use th e Quantity Theory of Money  to expand the Purchasing Power Parity Theory. 
The Quantity Theory of money begins with Equation 1 1, and we define every  term as: 
 
 Demand for money equals  MD. 
 We denote the price level  by P. 
 A country's real income is Y , and economists measure real income  by a country’ s real 
GDP. Moreo ver, P × Y represents a country’ s nominal GDP.  
 Unique term is the velocity of m oney, V.  
 
ܯ஽∙ܸ=ܲ∙ܻ          (11) 
 
People's demand for money  must equal the su pply of money. We denote the supply of 
money  by MS and substitute it  into the equation . Supply and demand for money must equal each 
other  because  a central bank injects money into the economy that th e public uses. Public cannot 
use money that the central b ank does not supply. The interest rate ensures the supply and 
demand of money equal each other. Furthermore, we  solve for the velocity of money, shown in 
Equation 12.  
 
SMYP=V
           (12) 
 
For example, if the nominal GDP of the United  States equals  $15 trillion or  P × Y, and the 
money supply is $1 trillio n, then the velocity of money equals  15. Consequently, each U.S. 
dollar is circulated in the economy 15 times during the year.  
We can substitute the Quantity Theory of Money into the Purc hasing Power Parity  
Equation , yielding Equation 13 . Price level for the Uni ted States is in the numerator  while  the 
price level for the Eurozone is in the denominator. Thus, the exchange rat e equals  U.S. dollars 
per euro.

Economists utilize  a mathematical tric k to convert the absolute levels  of Equation 13 into 
percent age change, yielding  Equation 14. We switched the variables  to lower case with a dot 
above each one to  indicate a percentage change  for that variable . 
 
US euro euro USS
euroS
US y y v v m m=s         (14) 
 
Economists can apply Equation 14 to many situations. For example, the real GDP is 
growing in Eurozone by 4% per year  while  the United States is experiencing a 3% real GDP 
growth. Furthermore, the European Central Bank expan ded the money by 2%  while  the Federal 
Reserve expanded the money supply by 3%. If the velocities for money do  not change (i.e. equal 
zero), subsequently , the euro should apprec iate by 2% against the U.S. dollar. Consequently, the 
higher real income and a s lowe r expanding money supply strengthen the  euro. Remember, the 
denominator of the fraction defines the domestic currency . 
International Fisher Effect  
The Fisher Effect  relates the nominal interest rate to the rate of inflation and real interest 
rate. We d efine the terms  as the following:  
 
 Real interest rate equals  r. 
 Nominal interest rate equals  i. 
 Expected inflation rate equals  . 
We define t he Fisher  Effect  by Equation 15 : 
 
݅+1=(1+ݎ)(1+ߨ)         (15) 
 
Many economists use algebra to reduce the Fisher Effect to Equation 16 , which becomes  an 
approximation . They set  the cross term, r × , to zero . 
 
݅=(1+ݎ)(1+ߨ)−1=1+ݎ+ߨ+ߨݎ−1≈ݎ+ߨ    (16) 
 
As long as the expected inflation and real interest rates are small, then the approximation  
will be  accurate . For e xample, i f the expected inflation, , is 10% and nomin al interest rate, i, 
equals  5%, subsequently,  the real interest rate is  approximately  -5%. Cross term, r  × , is 
roughly 0.5%. Consequently, a ll prices in a society ri se by 10% while  your nominal investment  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
215 
 only grew by 5% . Unfortunately, a person facing this scenario would lose nearly 5% of his or 
her purchasing power  every year . 
The International Fisher Effect  relates the real interest rate to a nominal intere st rate in a 
foreign co untry. We  build upon the Law of One P rice for financial transactions. For instance, 
international investors should earn comparable returns in foreign countries as compared to their 
home country after we adjust their returns to  a currency 's exchange rate . Thus, the currency 
exchange rates ref lect interest rate differences the  international investors can pr ofit. We must  be 
careful  because  investors are not tra ding commodities. They choose whether  to invest in a 
foreign country. We define the mathematical nota tion as the following:  
 
 Domestic nominal interest rate in APR  is id, while  rd represents  the domestic rate of retu rn 
of the investment in T days.  
 Foreign nominal interest  in APR  rate for an investment for T days  is if.  
 Percent change in the exchange rate from the beginning of  the investment period to  the 
time period T  is e. 
We derive  the Inte rnational Fishe r Effect  with Equation 17 . Domestic  return is the interest 
rate earned by a $1 investment in a foreign bank account  after T days of maturi ty conv erted into 
the domestic country’ s currency . If the domestic  currency is appreciating , a positive e , then this 
weakens  the return on the foreign investment , making r d smaller . On the other hand, if the 
domestic  currency is depreciating , a negative e , subsequently, the returns to the foreig n 
investment become greater . Thus,  both the foreign interest rate and change of c urrency exchange 
rate determine  an investor’s real return.

An international investor is indifferent between investing within his home country or 
investing in a foreign country. Consequently, arbitrage drives the rate of returns together. First, 
we solve Equation 17  for r d. Then we set Equations 17 and 18  equal to each other  because  
international arbitrage causes  both investment  returns  to converge to the same rate,  shown in  
Equation 19 .

The I nternational Fisher Effect lets analysts and economists  solve for  equilibrium exchange 
rates. Equilibrium occurs when no capital flows  from one country to another. Once investors 
have exhausted the ir arbitrage opportunities,  they stop moving  their capital  to the foreign 
country . If the Internati onal Fisher Effect holds, subsequently,  the expected cost and exp ected 
return of lending funds becomes  identical across currencies.  
For example, t he domestic interest rate for United States is i d = 3%  while  the fo reign 
interest rate for Japan equals  if = 12%. If an  investment period is 90 days , subsequently,  we use 
the International Fisher Effect to predict  the exchange rate changes . The U.S. dollar should 
appreciate approximately 2.25%  that we  calcula ted in Equation 22 .

Result seems counterintuitive  because  we expect the country with the g reater interest rate  to 
experience an ap preciating currency. Usually, international investors want to earn  the higher 
interest rate , causing a strong  demand for that country’ s currency. Consequently, that country's 
currency should appreciate  in the short run. However, a country with a greater interest rate 
woul d experience higher inflation, and  the central bank cannot sustain the high  interest rate . 
Thus, that country's currency would depreciate in t he long run  as the central bank expands the 
money supply . Hence, Equations 20 and 21  are long -run equilibrium equations.  
For t he second example , the Mexican Peso Crisis struck Mexico d uring the early 1990s, 
when the Mexica n peso depreciated roughly  5% per year. Interest rate differential between 
Mexico and the United States (i MEX – iUS) range d between 7% and 16%. A country with a 
great er interest rate relative to another country  has a d epreciating currency  over time . 
Conseq uently, the Mexican peso had  depreciated in December 1994 , triggering  Mexico’ s 
financial crisis .  Money, Banking, and International Finance

 Fidelity utilize d this financing st rategy to earn profits from the  large interest rate di fference . 
 
 Fidelity b orrowed fu nds from the United States at i d = 5% and invested in Mex ican funds 
and earned the  interest rate, i f = 12%. Thus, t he interest rate differential (i MXN – iUS) is 7%, 
while  the investment period equals  one year.  
 Fidelity c onvert ed U.S. dollars to Mexican p esos on the spot market at time t to invest in 
Mexico and then convert ed pesos back into U.S. dollars after the investment  had matured. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar appreciated  approximately 5% or e = 5%. Remember, we 
defined Mexico  as the foreign country whi le the United States is the domestic country.  
We compute Fidelity's  expected re turn from Mexican investment  in Equation 23 .

We calculate the expected profit by subtracting investment earnings from the  cost of 
borrowing, or  6.7% – 5% = 1.7 % per year. Fidelity utilized  this strategy during the early 1990s  
and earned profits between 1.5% and  11%. Unfortunately, Fidelity lost all its profits in 
December 1994 after the Tequila D evaluation. Fidelity used  a strategy called an uncovered 
position  because  Fidelity exposed itself to a n exchange rate risk  because it relied on a future 
spot exchange rate . Fidelity should  have used a covered position , where it uses derivatives 
contracts to protect its  future cash flows from a foreign investment . 
Interest Rate Parity Theorem  
Investors use  Interest Rate Parity Theorem  to price forward contracts. A f orward contract’s 
price or iginates from interest rate difference  between countries . Consequently, i nternational 
investors move financial capital into countries with higher interest rates. We can  examine price 
derivatives contracts and predict future  exchange rates. We list t he math ematical notation  below:  
 
 Domestic nominal interest rate in APR  equals  id while the rate of return is r d. 
 Foreign nominal interest rate in APR  is if while the  foreign  rate of return equals  rf. 
 Currency spot  exchange ra te at time t  is S. We write the exchan ge rate  as a ratio, such as $ 
per euro. Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
218 
  Forward contract issue d today at time t for currency delivery on  a future specific date on  T 
is F.  
International investors use  arbitrage  to price a forward contract. An investor invest s $1 
within the United States for T days  and earns the domestic interest rate. We compute h is or her 
rate of return in U.S. dollar in Equation 25 .

For example, the interest rate in the  United States is 5% and  3% for Malaysia. If the spot 
U.S. dollar -Malaysian ringgit exchange rate equals  $0.3333 per ringgit, then  we price  a six -
month forw ard con tract for  $0.3366  per ringgit. Thus, investors believe the Malaysian ringgits 
will appreciate  roughly  1% while  the U.S. dollar will depreciate. This sounds counter intuitive  
because  investors are attracted and want to earn the greater int erest rate . Howeve r, this analysis 
assumes arbitrage brings the two investments into equality. If the interest rates differ between 
two countries, the country with a higher  nominal interest rate must greater inflation that would 
depreciate its currency . Therefore, this anal ysis assumes a country with a higher interest rate 
possesses  a depreciating currency.  
We can revers e our logic to yield an identical e quation  to Equation  29. At time t, we borrow 
from a foreign bank one unit of a foreign currency for T days. When we repay the bank loan on

Arbitrage adjustment process  can be slow , and rates of returns can differ  between countries . 
Thus, international investors can exploit these differences to earn a higher ra te of return. For  
example, a U.S. investor  can i nvest in the United States to earn 2% interest or invest in Japan to 
earn 5%. He plans to invest for one year. Spot exchange rate is $0.0127 per yen  while  a one -year

We explain the derivatives market  in this chapter . Up to this point, we assumed all 
transactions were spot transactions. Buyers and sellers exchange  money and the financial 
instrument immediately. In a derivatives market, investors can buy and  sell contracts  today  that 
specify future  purchase s of financial securiti es and commodities. This  chapter explains the 
derivative forms : futures and options cont racts , credit default swaps , and currency swaps . 
Finally, we distinguish the role between hedging and speculation . Although derivative  contracts 
allow investors to protect themselves from future price volatility, speculators can buy  and sell 
derivatives to  earn large profits  or suffer massive losses . 
Forward and Spot Transactions  
Financial derivatives received bad publicity from in famous bankruptcies during  the 1990s 
and from the 2008 Financial Crisis. In 1995, Orange County, California , experienced the largest 
bankruptcy for a municipal go vernment with losses near ly $2 billion. Press concentrated on 
derivatives as the cause of the bankruptc y, but the fund manager made poor  decisions. An other 
famous case was Barings PL C. Barings was a Lon don investment firm that was founded in 
1763. One trader, Nick Leeson, lost roughly $1.3 billion in the  derivatives market, bankrupting  
Barings. Finally, commercial and investment banks created a variety of new securities, called 
Credit Default Swaps (CDS)  that played a role in the 2008 Financial Crisis. CDS is similar to 
insurance for investors. The 2008 Financial Crisis created hardship on many financial firms and 
investment banks. These institutions guaranteed payment  on pools of mortgages that  
bankrupte d. Thus, these firms paid billions of dollars in payouts to honor these CDS contracts. 
We discuss CDS contracts in  this chapter.  
Derivatives are  a contract , a piece of paper . Farmers and merchants invented derivatives in 
the Middle Ages to protect themselv es from price fluctuations. Buyers and sellers  agree to a 
price today, but they exchange the good  for money at a future date. Financial derivatives protect 
investors from price uncertainty. Previous chapters focused on  spot transactions , where a  buyer 
and seller complete a transaction by immediately exchanging money for the commodity. 
However, forward transactions  delay the exchange of money and assets to a future date. For 
example, a bread company  needs six tons of flour in six months. Many things could oc cur 
within six months. A d rought causes  the wheat’s price  to soar, or heavy rains co uld cause a 
bumper crop, causing  the wheat’s price  to plummet. Bread company wants to protect itself from 
fluctuating prices. Consequently, the bread company enters into co ntracts with wheat farmers, 
where the bread company and farmers negotiate a price of wheat today. However,  the bread 
company will  pay the farmers for the wheat when the  farmers  harvest  the wheat  six months from 
now. Contract  protect s both the bread company  and farmers from price fluctuations.  
Price of derivatives receive s or "derives"  their value from the underlying assets. Assets 
could be commodities such as coffee, corn, petroleum,  pork bellies, and wheat, or financial  
assets  such as stocks, bonds , currencies,  Eurodollars, and other financial in struments . Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
224 
 Derivatives  are contracts , and buyers and sellers exchange the c ontract s in the derivative 
markets . They do not trade asset s. Common  derivative s are futures, forwards, options, Credit 
Default Swaps,  and currency swaps .  
Investors use two strategies to invest  in the financial markets: Speculation and hedging. 
Some investors  use speculation  when they  buy or sell securities because they believe  they can 
sell the securities for a higher price in the futu re. Speculators search  for quick p rofits and  are 
gamblers. As you guessed, a  speculator  can gain or lose massive amounts  of money from the 
derivatives m arket. Speculators are vital  to the market  because th eir presence  increase s the 
liquidity of the securit ies. 
Investors use hedging  to buy and sell securities to reduce risk or use long -term investment 
strategies. Hedger protects himself in three ways by using derivatives. First, he locks in a future 
price today, protecting himself from price fluctuations. Se cond, derivatives are liquid assets. If 
an investor needs money now, he easily can sell his futures contract in a derivatives market. 
Finally, investors buy and sell derivative on organized exchanges, and they can monitor and 
gather information on market p rices of derivatives.  
Hedgers use financial derivatives for the following three cases:  
Case 1:  Hedger uses a financial derivat ive to reduce price uncertainty  because a derivative 
locks in a future price today.  
Case 2:  Hedger could reduce the interest -rate risk. If a banker knows he or she will grant a 
loan on a specific date  in the future, subsequently, he or she  can buy a derivative that locks in 
the future interest rate. Interest rate becomes the price on the  financial derivative . Thu s, the 
banker borrow s at a low interest rate and lend s at a high interest rate.  
Case 3:  Hedger could reduce the exchange rate risk. Currency exchange rate is the price in 
a currency derivative. For example, a corpor ation operates  in a foreign country. If that country 's 
currenc y depreciates, then a corporation  could  experience gains or losses  in profits from that 
country.  
Futures and Forward Contracts  
First class of derivatives is futures  and forward contracts . They  specify size, matur ity date, 
and price. Size indicates  the numb er of units in each contract, while t he maturity date is the day  
the parties complete the transaction . Finally, the futures price is the selling price of the asset on 
the maturity  date. However, f utures differ from  forwards . A forward contract is tailor ma de that 
banks or dealers issue . Issuer’s reputation and collateral guarantee the contra ct. On the other 
hand, a futures  contract is  standardized . Maturity, size, and collateral are the same for all 
contracts. Standardized contracts allow investors to buy and sell futures con tracts on organized 
exchanges. For example, t he Chicago Board of Trade allows futures for agricultural products 
and precious metals, while the New York Mercantile Exchange allows the exchange for energy 
commodities like petroleum and el ectricity.  
Futures and forward contracts allow the buyer and seller to agree on a price for a 
commodity  today , and the exc hange of money for the commodity  will occur on a specific date in 
the future. For example, you  buy a government bond one year from now . You could enter a 
futures contract where you and the seller agree on th e price today, but you pay for the Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
225 
 government bond one year from now. Futures contract is a legal document that assigns rights. A 
buyer’s right obligates you to buy  the government bon d, called the long position . Seller’s right 
obligates him or her  to sell you the government bond , called the short position . 
Derivatives market determines the p rice of the futures contract. Futures price reflects the 
expectations of  investors and savers. F or example, you bought a futures contract for petroleum, 
and you negotiated a price of $80 per barrel. Seller will deliver the oil  within six months. You 
could sell your futures contract on the derivatives market  if you no longer want the contract. If 
investors and savers believe that oil will be $90 per barrel, then the market value of your futures 
contract rises . You could either sell your futures contract for a higher price or wait until you 
receive the oil and sell the oil for $10 per barrel profit. How ever, the opposite could occur. If 
investors and savers believe the price of oil will be $70 per barrel, then the market value of your 
futures co ntract drops . You must buy  oil for $80 per barrel that  costs $70 in the future.  
Speculato rs buy  derivatives  because the market value of the derivatives could  experience 
wide swings . As the date of the delivery approaches for a futures contract, the futures contract 
market price will converge to the spot price. On the day of delivery, the m arket value of a 
derivati ve must  equal the spot price. A buyer never  purchase s a futures contract  if the market 
price of the futures contract exceeds  the spot price. For example, if petroleum costs $90 per 
barrel toda y, then a buyer would never  buy a contract today for a petroleum price of $91 or 
higher. Furthermore, a seller would never sell a futures contract, when the market price of the 
futures contract is lower than the spot price. For instance, if the spot petroleum market price 
were  $90 p er barrel today, then no one would sell a derivatives contract that matures today for a 
price below $90.  
Buyers and sellers do not know each other when they buy or sell a futures contract through 
an exchange. Consequently, a buyer or seller deposits money with a broker to cover p ossible 
losses from a  futures contract. As the spot market price changes for a commodity daily, either  
the buyer or seller will  lose money  if the exchange occurs today.  However, the loser deposits 
money into a margin account. A marg in account  helps guarantee the parties will honor the 
contract . Usually the market price must  exceed some threshold befo re a buyer or seller must  
deposit money.  (A forward contract may not have a margin account).  
Example 1 : A petroleum refinery buys 10 fut ures contracts of petrole um that matures in six 
months. Contract size is 10,000 barrels of petroleum with a contract price of  $75 per barrel.  
Who pays the margin  if the spot petroleum price equals  $90 per barrel today? Seller 
deposits  000150 75 90 0001010 ,$=$ $ ,  with his broker. If this contract matured today, then 
a buyer would purchase  this oil for $75 and  sell it for $90, earning a larg e profit of $15 per 
barrel. If  a speculator bought 10 petroleum contract s, he or she could earn $150,000  if the 
derivatives contracts matured today.  
Who pays the margin  if the petroleum price falls to $60 per barrel? Buyer deposits 
 000150 60 75 0001010 ,$=$ $ ,  with his broker. If this contract matured today, then the 
seller w ould buy oil on the spot market for $60 per barrel and sell  it to the buyer for $75, earning 
a large profit of $15 per barrel. If a speculator bought 10 contracts, subsequently, he or she 
would earn a $150,000 loss  if the contracts matured today. Thus, speculators could earn 
enormous profits or experience massive losses from the derivatives markets.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
226 
 Derivatives can protect investors from interest rate risks. Interest -rate risk is a bank borrows 
funds for a greater interest rate than the  bank earns on its loan. Remem ber, banks lend money 
for a great er interest rate than the funds they borrow, earning profits. Unfortunately, the interest -
rate risk could reverse this , imposing losses on a bank . 
Example 2: You manage a money -market mutual fund and it is June 2012. A money -
market fund is a fund filled with  financial secu rities with maturities of a year or less . Moreover, 
you expect an inflow of $1 million in funds in June 2013. You can buy a futures contract today 
that earns a 10% return for your funds in Ju ne 2013, and you begin  earning interest after  June 
2013 . If the i nterest rate falls , the derivatives contract guarantees you a 10% return, protecting 
your fund. A futures contract could be for Certificates of Deposit (CDs). A CD is customer  
deposits money into a bank account f or a fixed time period and is  similar to a savings account. If 
customer s close and withdraw  their CDs before maturity , then they forfeit  the CDs interest . 
Many countries call CDs as time deposits.  
On the other side of the CD derivative, a bank grants a loan for $1 million to a customer 
next year. Bank would  transfer the funds in June 2013  at 12% interest rate. Bank could issue a 
Certificate of Deposit on the futures market at 1 0%. Subsequently, the bank has  guaranteed a 
funding source  next year for this loan. If i nterest rates rise next  year, then the futures contract 
protects the bank from interest -rate risk  because  the bank “locked” into a  funding source  at 10% 
that ensures a  profit of 2%.  
Futures and forward contracts can reduce exchange rate risk. If a corporation operates  in a 
foreign  country, that corporation can  use derivatives contracts to protect itself from currency 
exchange rate fluctuations.  
Example 3 : Exxo n is a U.S. corporation that uses  U.S. dollars to purchase petroleum from 
Malaysia. Consequently, Exxon needs Malaysian ringgits and enters into a futures contract  
because  Exxon must pay 3,000,000 ringgits  in 90 days. A Malaysian bank issued a derivatives 
contract that specifies the excha nge rate as $1 = 3 ringgits.  
Exchange rate s between count ries fluctuate continually . Who pays the margin  if the 
exchange rate changes to  $1 = 4 ringgits? The U.S. dollar appreciated  while  the ringgit 
depreciated. Unfortunately, Exxon has U.S. dollars, and it contracted to pay a lower exchange 
rate. Thus, Exxon must deposit money into the margin account  because  Exxon “locked” into a 
depreciating contract . On the other side of the contract, the bank benefits from this contract.  
Easy way to determine who m benefits is to convert the ringgits into U.S. dollars for both 
the spot and futures market. We computed the spot transaction in  Equation 1  and the futures 
contract in  Equation 2.  
 
Spot mar ket: 750,000

Futures market:  000,000,1313,000,000 $=rm$rm      (2) 
 Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
227 
 Exxon  loses on the futures contract  because  it must pay o ne million U.S. dollars to pay  its 
contract in Malaysia. If a speculator bought this contract from the Malaysian bank , then he or 
she loses approximately $250,000 on this contract  if the contract matured today.  Malaysian bank 
profits by buying 3 million ringgits for $750,000 and selling them for $1 million to Exxon.  
Who pays the margin  if the exchange rate changes to  $1 = 2 ringgits? Ringgits appreciated  
while  the U.S. dollar depreciated. The Malaysian bank must deposit money into a margin 
account. In this case, Exxon benefits from the exchange rate  because  its ringgit contract has 
appreciated. Easy way to determine w hom benefits is to convert the ringgits into U.S. dollars for 
both the spot and futures market. We calculate spot transaction  in Equation 3  and the f utures 
transaction  in Equation 4.  
 
Spot market:  000,500,1
21000 3,000 $=
rm$rm ,      (3) 
Futures market:  000,000,1
31000 3,000 $=
rm$rm ,      (4) 
 
Exxon gains from the derivatives contract  because  it pays  one million U.S. dollars. 
However, if Exxon exchanged its U.S. dollars on the spot market, t hen Exxon would exchange  
one and a half -million U.S. dollars  pay its ringgit contract in Malaysia. For this case, a 
speculator could earn a profit of a half -million U.S. dollars  if the futures contract matured toda y. 
Speculator buys 3 million ringgits for $1 million and sells them for $1.5 million.  
Options Contract  
Options contract  represents  the second class of derivatives. Options contract differs from a 
futures contract  because the option holder has the choice to buy or sell an asset. For example, 
you entered into an options contract , giving you the right to buy petroleum for $80  per barrel in 
6 months. On the day of delivery, if the price of oil equals  $70 per barrel, you do not  exercise  
the options contract. That is your option! If oil is $90 per barrel on the day of delivery, then yo u 
will exercise  your options contract. Invest or who sold y ou this contract must  sell the oil for $80 
per barrel to you. Options contracts are defined as either call or put options. Call option  gives 
the holder the right to buy an asset for a specific pric e in the future. On the other hand, t he put 
option gives the holder the right to sell an asset for a specific price in the future.  
All options have an exercise or strike price ; the price  listed on the option. Option has an 
expiration date,  which is the date the right to  buy or sell expires. Furthermo re, options are either 
American or European. American options  allow the option holder to exercise the option any 
time before the expiration date, while the European options  restrict the right to exercise the 
option on the expiration date. Furthermore, opti ons are not free. Option holders  must  pay a fee , 
called the option premium . Calculating premiums and exercising options are different between 
American and European options. K eeping the chapter simple, we use the European options for 
all examples . Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
228 
 Amount paid for an option premium  depends on the probability  the buyer of the option will 
exercise his right. Thus, options contracts are insurance. For example, a driver with a history of 
car accidents usually haves a great er probability of having future acciden ts. Hence, this driver 
pays a greater premium for his car insurance company . 
We list five f actors that  influence an option premium : 
 
 If the spot market price rises , subsequently, the option's premium for a European call 
option increase s while  the premium d ecreases for the put option. Remember, the option 
holder s would  exercise an option if  they can buy low and sell high. Investor would more 
likely exercise the call option to buy at the strike price and sell at the spot price. Put option 
is the opposite.  
 If the strike price increases , then the option's premium for a European call option decreases  
while  the premium increases for a put option.  Investor would not exercise the call option if 
the strike price exceeds the spot price. Otherwise, he would buy high an d sell low. On the 
other hand, an investor would exercise a put option if the strike price exceeds the spot 
price. He or she buys low using the spot price to sell to the option holder using the strike 
price.  
 If a commodity's price is highly volatile, subse quently, the commo dity's price fluctuates 
greatly , and an option holder is  likely to exercise both the call and put options. 
Consequently, the option issuer charges a greater option premium for both calls and puts. 
For example, the market price of Asset A fluctuates between $20 and $100  while  Asset B 
fluctuates between $60 and $70. Therefore, the opt ion premium  for Asset A is great er 
because  the large swings in the price boosts  the likelihood the  investor exercises the option . 
 An option with a l onger time m aturity has a greater  option premium. For example, Option 
A has a maturity of one year while Option B has a maturity of one month. Thus, Option A 
has a larger option premium  because  investors experience  more uncertainty in its asset’s 
prices. Dramatic even ts could happen during the year that ensures the investors exercise the 
option . 
 Interest rates affect options just like bonds and stock. A higher interest rate reduces the 
present value of the option, increasing the value of the call option and decreasing the value 
of the put option.  
Example 1 : Strike price for petroleum is $80 per barrel, and the European's option premium 
equals  $0.1 per barrel with an option size of 10 ,000 barrels. A company  buys 10 call options  
with a t otal quantity of petroleum of  100,000 barrels. Thus, the company  pays 
00010 10 000100.1 ,$= , $   for the premium.  
Two scenarios  occur with an options contract:  
Scenario 1: If the spot market price exceeds the $80 strike price, then the company 
exercises the call options. Company buys petr oleum at $80 and  resell s the petroleum on the spot Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
229 
 market to earn a large profit. For example, if the spot price for petroleum is $90 per barrel,  we 
computed the company could earn $990,000 in profits in Equation 5:  
 
ݐ݂݅݋ݎ݌= (ݐ݋݌ݏ	݁ܿ݅ݎ݌−݁݇݅ݎݐݏ	݁ܿ݅ݎ݌) ∙ݕݐ݅ݐ݊ܽݑݍ −݉ݑ݅݉݁ݎ݌    (5) 
ݐ݂݅݋ݎ݌= ($90−$80)∙100 ,000−$10,000 =$990,000  
 
Scenario 2: If spot market price falls  below $80 per barrel, subsequently, the company does 
not exercise the opti on. However, the company has  paid the  $10,000 premium . 
Example 2 : Strike price for a European put option is $40 per  ton of corn, and the premium 
equals  $0.07 per ton. Each option contract specifies a quantity of 10,000 tons. A farmer buys 
five put options, insuring 50, 000 tons of corn. Consequently, the farmer pays $0.07 × 10,000 × 5 
= $3,500 in premiums.  
A farmer will experience two scenarios:  
Scenario 1:  If the spot market price exceeds the $40 strike price, then the farmer does not 
exercise put option  because  he or she could sell corn for a greater price on the spot market. 
Nevertheless, the farmer  has paid the option premium of $3,500.  
Scenario 2:  If spot market price falls  below the $40 per ton strike price, subsequently, the 
farmer exercises the put option.  Accordingly, the farmer could buy corn from the spot market 
and sell to the holder of the put option. For example, the spot corn price is $25 per ton. 
Consequently,  we calculate  the farmer earns $746,500 in profit in Equation 6.  
 
ݐ݂݅݋ݎ݌= (݁݇݅ݎݐݏ	݁ܿ݅ݎ݌−ݐ݋݌ݏ	݁ܿ݅ݎ݌) ∙ݕݐ݅ݐ݊ܽݑݍ −݉ݑ݅݉݁ݎ݌    (6) 
ݐ݂݅݋ݎ݌= ($40−$25)∙50,000−$3,500 =$746,500  
 
Currency options are similar to commodity options , but the strike price is an exchange rate. 
Furthermore, Currency options have two markets. First, Interbank (OTC) market  is located in 
London, New York, and Tokyo , and t he OTC options are tailor -made for size, maturity, and 
exercise price. Second, Philadelphia, United States has a  market for currency options with fixed  
maturi ties at 1, 3, 6, and  12 months.  
Although currency options are more complicated to understand, the trick is to calculate both 
scenarios: exercise or not exercise the option. Then choose the scenario that yields the greater 
benefit  to the option holder . 
Example 3:  An investor b uys a six million ringgit European call option, and he or she has 
U.S. dollars. Call option has a strike price of $0.3 US  / ringgit. Did you notice the ringgit is in 
the denominator of the strike price? Thus, we know this option is for ringgits. Premium eq uals 
$0.01 per ringgit, and the contract size is 100,000 ringgits. Investor needs 60 contracts and pays 
$60,000 for the premium , calculated in Equation 7.  
 
00060 60.01,$= ringgits million
ringgit$premium       (7) 
 
Investor faces two scenarios on the expiration date:  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
230 
 Scenario 1:  If the exchange rate exceeds $0.3 US  per ringgit, then the investor exercises the 
call option. For example, if the exchange rate equaled $0.4 US  / ringgit, subsequently, the 
ringgit appreciated while the U.S. dollar depreciated. Investor needs $1.8 million (0 .3 × 6 
million) to purchase the six million ringgits using the call option, or he  or she pays $2.4 million 
(0.4 ×  6 million)  if the investor buys  the ringgits on the spot market. We calculate d a 
specul ator's profit of  $594,000 in Equation 8.  Speculator can  buy at the exercise price and sell 
on the spot market.

Scen ario 2:  If the exchange rate drops  lower than $0.3 US / ringgit, then the investor does 
not exercise the call option. For i nstance, if the exchange rate equals  $0.2 US / ringgit, 
subsequently, the ringgit depreciated while the U.S. dollar appreciated. Investor pays $1.2 
million for the six million ri nggit (0.2 ×  6 million), or he or she could exercise the call opt ion 
and pay $1.8 million (0.3 ×  6 million). Thus, this investor would not exercise the call option , but 
a speculator would earn a loss, which equals the premium.  
Example 4 : An investor has U.S. dollars and wants to sell 500 thousand euros using a 
European put option. Strike price is $0.8 US / euro. Premium equals  $0.02 US per euro  while 
the contract size is  25,000 euros. Investor needs 20 contracts and pays $20,000 for the premium , 
calculated in Equation 9. Investor needs 20 contracts.  
 
00010 €000500€0.02,$= ,$premium         (9) 
 
Investor observes two scenarios on the expiration date:  
Scenario 1: If the exchange rate exceeds $0.8 US  / euro, then the investor s do not exercise 
the put option. Euro appreciated while the U.S. depreciated. For example, if the exchange rate 
rises to  $0.9 US  / euro, subsequently, the investor s sell  500,000 euros for $450,000 on the spot 
market. Investor s could sell those same euros for $400,000  if they had exercised the option. 
Thus, the investor s do not use the put option. S peculator s would earn a loss, equa ling the 
option's premium.  
Scenario 2: If the exchan ge rate drops  lower than $0.8 US  / euro, then the investor 
exercises the put option. For instance, if the exchange rate is $0.7 US  / euro, subsequently, the 
investor sells the 500,000 euros for $400,000  by exercising the put option . Instead, if the 
investor s sell  the e uros on the spot market, they  receive  $350,000 for those same euros. Thus, 
investor s exercise put option. S peculator s would earn $40,000 in profits  that we  calculated in 
Equation 10.

Did you notice something strange about the call and put options? Investors exercise call and 
put options “as opposi tes” when an investor  exercise s an option. Furthermore, we switched the 
exercise and spot prices  in Equations 8 and 10.  
Special Derivatives  
Several financial institutions offer futures and options that are based on a market index, 
such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. For example, the Chicago Board of 
Options Exchange (CBOE) offers options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which it calls 
DJX. Technically, the derivatives are not tied to  a commodity. A financial company does not 
invest in a mutual fund that mirr ors a stock index. For example, a fun d manager could buy 1,000 
shares each of every company listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and let investors buy 
into the fund. Instead, the financial companies base the stock market index  on a computed stock 
market index  and settle accounts in cash . Since no commodities are exchanged, the financial 
companies offer call and put options on  the stock market indices.  These companies cannot offer 
futures and forwards because buyers and sellers cannot trade a  commodity.  
Issuers of index derivatives could suffer large losses to rapid  market changes . For example, 
one investor, Nick Leeson, bankrupted Bari ngs, P.L.C. Nick Lesson observed  the stocks on the 
Tokyo stock market  fluctuated over a narrow range . The Nikkei stock index fluctuated around 
20,000 points  in 1995 . Nick Leeson  used a straddle  and issued an equal number of call and put 
options with identical maturities for the Nikkei stock index. Hence, the i nvestors  rarely 
exercise d the options  because  the stock prices  fluctuated over a narrow range . Thus, the option 
premiums became  pure profit s to Barings. As profits were soaring,  the top management  at 
Barings let Nick Leeson continue his speculation . Then an earthquake struck  Kobe, Japan , and 
both the  stock prices  and Nikkei average fe ll rapidly  on the Tok yo stock exchange. Leeson 
speculated the  stock prices would increase and bought futures contracts  to protect his position. 
Subsequently, t he stock prices continued plummeting , resulting in a $1 .4 billion loss for 
Barings. Unfortun ately, Barings was forced to settle  with option holders who bet the Nikkei 
average would fall . 
The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) offers put and call options for the 
Volatility Index (VIX) , calculated from Standard & Poor's ( S&P) 500 -stock index. The VIX 
represents  a meas ure of risk and volatility, otherwise known as the investor's fear gauge. Similar 
to a stock index derivative, the options are not tied to an ass et or commodity. On maturity, a 
holder receives  payment  as the CBOE settles the obligation in cash. Furthermore , the VIX 
suffers from exposure  if the VIX increases or decreases dramatical ly. Then CBOE could suffer 
large losses as it pays out for exercised options.  
One must  be careful with  the meaning of the VIX number . For example, if the VIX equals 
20, subsequently, the investors expect the S&P 500 -stock index to swing by 20% over the next 
12 months. If the VIX increases, then investors become more pessimistic and the financial 
markets become more volatile. Some economists and analysts use the VIX as  a recession 
indicator,  shown in Figure 1. During the 2008 Financial Crisis, the VIX peaked at 60, and the 
stock markets lost roughly  half their market value during 2009.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

Insurance companies and in vestment banks created Credit Default Swaps (CDS) . This 
financial instrument is similar to insurance. Some investors would like to purchase speculative 
grade (i.e. risky) bonds because these bonds pay greater interest rates than safe investments. 
However, if the business bankrupts, then these bonds become worthless and the investors lose 
their investment. Thus, CDSs were born. Investors could buy both risky bonds and CDS 
contracts. Furthermore, investors would pay premiums on CDSs as if they were paying for  
insurance to the investment banks or insurance companies. If a company did bankrupt and its 
risky bonds collapsed in value, subsequently, the investment bank or insurance company would 
pay the investors their loss specified under the CDS contract. If the company with the risky 
bonds did not bankrupt, then the investment bank kept the premium payments as profits. 
Subsequently, investors can buy and sell credit default swaps on the derivatives market.  
CDSs have two severe  drawback s. First, CDS contracts are not transparent. Many investors 
did not understand how to use CDS except the analysts at the large investment banks. Second, 
investors  rarely buy CDS contracts for bonds or other debt from financially strong companies 
with AAA ratings. These companies are not likely to bankrupt, and investors have little reason 
to purchase insurance for an un likely event. Investors are  likely to purchase insurance for 
probable events. Thus, investors are  likely to purchase CDSs for speculative grade bonds or 
debt. Furthermo re, companies rarely file for bankruptcy during good economic times, even risky 
busine sses that issued risky bonds. C onsequently, the investment banks woul d collect CDS 
premiums as  pure profit. During good times, AAA rated companies have a zero default rat e 
while speculative grade bonds have a default rating less tha n 4%. However, during the 2001 
Recession, AAA rated companies still had close to a zero default rate  while  the default rate 
soared  to 10% for speculative investments. As bankruptcies climb, comp anies can accumulate 
staggering losses  during a downturn in the economy.  
Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
233 
 Investors trade CDSs contracts  in the derivatives markets. Anyone can buy them, even if the 
investors do not own the risky bonds that are specified under the CDS contract. Therefore, 
speculators can enter the market and gam ble on outcomes. For example, gambler s believe  
Company XYZ will bankrupt. These  gambler s do not hold any bonds for this company, but they 
buy CDS contract s. Gambler s only  pay the CDS premiums. However, if this compan y does 
indeed bankrupt, then the gambler s receive  a payout from the issuer of the CDS contract. If 
Company XYZ does not bankrupt, subsequently, the gambler s lose their bet, the CDS 
premiums . Imagine the  money people  could earn  if they had inside information about a 
company’s finances.  
Some i nvestors  bet the housing market would collapse and bought CDS contracts on risky 
mortgage pools. Investors bought CDS contracts on mortgage asset -backed securities  because  
they predicted the collapse of the hou sing bubble in 2007 and purchased CDS contracts as a bet. 
As the mortgage asset -back funds bankrupted, the holders of CDS contracts requested their 
payouts. If you are experiencing  trouble understanding CDS contracts, then think of this 
analogy. You bought  insurance on your neighbor’s house, and you pray  for the house to burn 
down to  collect the insurance.  
The CDS contracts have a flaw. A company can stack CDS contracts  upon  other  CDS 
contracts. For example, Company X buys a CDS contract from an insurance c ompany and pays 
2% of the contract’s value as a premium. Unfortunately, the financial heal th of the company, 
specified in  the CDS contract, deteriorates, increasing the risk on its bonds. Compa ny X can 
exploit this situation,  and create and sell a new CDS contract to Company Y for a 6% premium, 
earning 4% commission on the de al. If that company does bankrupt, then the insurance company 
pays Company X its CDS insurance, and in turn, Company X transfers its payout to Company 
Y, earning a quick 4% commission o n the deal. Thus, multiple CDS contracts insure the same 
debt. Unfortunately, the CDS contracts depend on one important assumption. Issuing companies 
can indeed pay out the CDS contracts if the companies fail.  
The CDS market in the United States quickly gr ew into $47 trillion market by June 2008, 
covering a d ebt of roughly $34 trillion. P utting this number into perspective, the size of the U.S. 
economy was roughly $14  trillion  in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012. Consequently, the 
potential losses if th e investment banks and insurance companies must pay out all CDS contracts 
would exceed three times the size of the U.S. economy. Commercial and investment bankers 
used CDS contracts to guarantee an AAA rating for Collateralized Debt Obligations, which 
contained securities tied to the mortgage market. They used t he CDS contracts to cancel the 
impact of subprime mortgages contained in the mortgage securities. We had discuss ed the 
Collateralize d Debt Obligations  in Chapter 10 under Securitization.  
During  the downturn of the U.S. economy  in December 2007, AIG  quickly accumulated 
billions in losses  as investors requested the payouts  from the CDS contracts. AIG’s losses 
exceeded $60 billion in 2009 and grew by the day. This became  the largest loss in U.S. 
corporate history. The U.S. federal government bailed out AIG by purchasing 80% equity into 
the company . Furthermore,  it promised AIG four bailout loans worth a total of $163 billion. 
Unfortunately, AIG worked with several investment banks like Goldman Sachs  and Lehman 
Brothers, which also experienced severe financial troubles.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
234 
 The U.S. government bailed out  the investmen t banks and insurance companies  except 
Lehman Brothers. After  the public had learned Lehman Brothers was insolvent , and the 
government would  not help it, the financia l markets plummeted  in September 2008. 
Furthermore, the credit markets froze as all financial institutions stop granting loans. Roughly 
350 banks and investors would lose their CDS insurance  because  Lehman Brothers issued 
approxim ately $400 billion in CDSs on debt that was valued  $155 billion. Unfortunately, 
Lehman Brothers issued more CDS contracts than the amount of debt by 2.5 times. Final ly, 
Lehman Brothers bankrupted and began  liquidati ng its assets. Lehman Brothers wa s the gr eatest 
casualty of t he 2008 Financial Crisis and the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Barclays, the 
second -largest bank in England, bought Lehman Brother’s U.S. core assets for $1.3 billion, 
including Lehman Brother’s skyscraper in Manhattan. Excessive greed doomed a 158 -year-old 
company.  
Evaluating Currency Swaps  
A currency swap  is a periodic exchange of foreign currencies between two parties , viewed 
as a swap of two forward currency contracts. O ne party is a swap dealer,  usually a banker while 
the other is an investor. Each payment to the counter -party is called a “leg.” Swaps allow 
companies to invest in foreign countries. Company borrows from its local bank at a low interest 
rate, and then swaps its loan with another company in the other  country, where it  invest s. Thus, 
the company has access to the foreign currency at a low interest rate. Swap contract s specify  the 
following:  
 
 Frequency of the payments between two parties.  
 Duration of the swap.  
 A method to calculate the swap payments or legs. One leg is a fixed payment while the 
other leg is a floating payment. Fixed payment has a fixed rate , called the coupon of the 
swap.  
We define swaps in four  ways, and they differ in how the payments of legs are indexed. 
This book only discusses a currency swap, where both legs of the swap are denominated in 
different currencies. At time period 0, the value of a swap to both parties should be 0 or close to 
0. No one  would enter a swap with a large negative present value for them. We list  the notation 
as: 
 
 Present value of discounted cash flows from the foreign currency cash flows is PV foreign .  
 Current spot exchange rate  is S 0, the time we calculate the swap ’s value . 
 Present value of discounted cash flows from the domestic currency cash f lows is PV domestic . Money, Banking, and International Finance

 We calculate the swap value  in Equation 11.

For example, Company XYZ enters into a 10 -year swap agreement with a dealer. Nine 
years have passed, and two semi -annual payments are remaining. Investors valued the swaps at  
$200 million and 210 million euros with coupon interest of 4% for U.S. dollars and 5% for 
euros. Therefore, coupon payments are $4 million and 5.25 million euros. Furthermore, the 
implicit exchange  rate is $4 million divid ed by 5.25 million euros, or  $0.762 per euro. However, 
the current spot exchange rate equals  St = $1.25 per euro. Current discount rates are 5% APR for 
the United States  and 6% APR in Europe.  
We compute the present value of cash f lows for  the European swap  in Equation 12 .

If Company XYZ  liquidate s the swap, the company must receive $61.9 million to sell the 
swap. Company XYZ benefited because the company is exchanging dollars fo r appreciating 
euros . Thus, the currency swap has a credit risk. Unfortunately, the other party, the dealer, has  a 
large negative present value and  could default on the swap.  
Why does the value of a currency swap change? Although t erms of the swap are fix ed, 
fluctuating interest rates and changing exchange rates alter  the swap’s value . If a co mpany holds 
a foreign currency while  the domestic exchange rate appreciates, then value of swap decreases. 
Remember the company entered into a contract for a foreign currency. If the domestic interest 
rate increases, subsequently, the present value of the swap rises. Moreover, if the foreign interest  
rate rises, then the present value of the swap must fall . Opposite is true for the issuer of the 
swap.

 19. Transaction  and Economic  Exposure s 
As a business invests or operates in a foreign country,  a changing  exchange rate causes 
gains or losses on internatio nal business activities. We define t hese gains or losses  as transaction 
exposure, economic exposure, translation exposure, and tax exposure. Consequently, this 
chapter defines the types of expos ures and outlines the strategies an international company can 
use to reduce its losses from the tran saction and economic exposures. Unfortunately, t he 
translation and tax exposures are beyond the scope of this book.  
Exposure  Types  
Firms are subjected to  currency risk,  called exposure . Exposure changes  a company's 
profits, net cash flow, and market value. Eve ry internat ional corporation or business can 
experience four exposures, originating  from their international activities. We explain each 
exposure  in det ail. 
Transaction exposure  comes from the risk of  transactions denominated in different 
currencies. Consequently, a change in an exchange rate alters the value of outstanding financial 
obligations , such as accounts receivable and accounts payable . Unfortuna tely, a change in an 
exchange rate impacts cash flow and alters a company's current contractual obligations. For 
example, Swiss Cruises, a Swiss company, buys U.S. supplies and se lls cruises to U.S. 
customers. Hence, i t prices its supplies and vacation cruises in U.S. dollars. Any fluctuations in 
the U.S. dollar -Swiss franc exchange rate  will alter its financial obligations.  
Economic exposure is how  a firm’s expected cash flows are affected by unexpected 
changes in currency exchange rates. Exchange  rate alters future sales , prices, and costs. We also 
call it operating exposure, competitive exposure, or strategic exposure . For example, Swiss 
Cruises pays  most  its costs  in francs and receives 50% of its revenues in U.S. dollars. 
Unfortunately, Swiss C ruises cannot raise i ts price because vacation cruises are  highly 
comp etitive , and it would lose customers by raising the price . If the Swiss franc is  appreciating 
while the U.S. dollar is depreciating, subsequently, its cash flows will worsen. Unfortunate ly, its 
revenues are in U.S. dollars that  are losing  value w hile its costs are in francs that are 
strengthen ing in value. Keep ing them straight, economic exposure is  how a change in an 
exchange rate influences  a company's  finances  over time , while transact ion exposure is a cha nge 
in exchange rates impact  current assets and liabilities.  
Translation exposure , referred  to as accounting exposure , is fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates affect a firm’s consolidate d statements . For example, Swiss Cruises has 
inventor ies of U.S. dollars and  U.S. dollar loan s of an equal amount. Then accountants convert 
balance sheet items into francs. A  depreciating U.S. dollar causes the value of loans to decrease 
because its liabilities are decreasing. However, the value of c urrent assets is decreasing  from the 
dollar inventories. Nevertheless, due to Swiss accounting rules, accountants use different 
exch ange rates  to convert  U.S. dollar inventories and the U.S. dollar loan s into francs . 
Consequently,  accountants generate  accountin g gains or losses by using the various exchange Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
239 
 rates to calculate a company’s financial statements . Company must  consider the accounting 
rules among different countries, and how cash flows will impact a company’s financial 
statements.  
Tax exposure  is fluctuations  in currency exchange rates affect a company's cash flow , and 
hence its  taxable income. Thus, losses from transaction exposure can reduce taxable income , 
whereas l osses from economic  exposure reduce tax able income over future years. On the oth er 
hand, t ranslation exposures are not related to cash flow s and do no t reduce taxable income. 
Thus , companies could  gain profit  from favorable changes in the exchange rates.  
Measuring and Protecting a gainst Transaction Exposure  
We can identify and measure  transaction exposure . Firms  sell products or purchase 
resources  by entering contracts . Firms can even buy and sell contracts on the derivatives markets 
to hedge against price uncertainty. If firms do not have contracts, then they must  forecast future 
spot prices , and spot prices can fluctuate wildly . 
For example, Swiss Cruises sold cruise packages to a U. S. wholesaler for $2.5 million U.S. 
dollars  and bo ught fuel oil for $1.5 million in U.S. dollars . Both transactions will occur in 30 
days, giving a predic table cash flow. If today's spot exchange rate is 1.45 Swiss francs equal $1, 
then we calculate d the profit , 1.45 million francs by using Equation 1 . 
 
  francs 000, 1,450= 000, 1,500$ 000, 2,500$1$franc 1.45= profit     (1) 
 
However, the transaction occurs in 30 days, and the spot exchange rate can fluctuate. 
Consequently, Swiss Cruises profits in francs will fluctuate along with the exchange rate . A 
large company w ould employ a  specialist who predicts and forecasts prices and  exchange rates . 
In Swiss Cruises ' case, the specialist  has determined  the franc -U.S. dollar exchange rate  
fluctuate s ±10%. Thus, the net transaction  exposure  could fluctuate  between 1,305,000 and 
1,595,000 francs , which we calculate  by multiplying the profit  by 1±0.10 , or by 0.9 for the 
lower number and 1.1 for the upper number . In this case, Swiss Cruises has  a favorable 
transaction exposure  because  revenues in dollars always exceed the costs in dollars.  
A company can use strategies  to protect its revenues and expenses in a foreign country. For 
example, a U.S. company, Trident, s old equipment to a British company for 3 million pounds 
due in 90 days  as an accounts receivable . Although Tride nt sold the equipment, it must  wait 90 
days f or its revenue, and anything  could hap pen within 90 days. An analyst  at Trident views 
four strategies to reduce any losses from this international transaction. Strategies are:  
 
1. Spot exchange rate equals  $1.762  per 1 pound, and the company will  use the spot  exchange 
rate in 90 days.  
2. Trident Company  can use a derivatives contract. T rident can buy a  90-day forward contract 
with an exchange rate of  $1.785 / 1 pound  from a large bank .  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
240 
 3. Trident Company  can buy a 90 -day put option for pounds. Put option grants Trident the right 
to sell British pounds at the strike price of $1.75 / pound with a premium of  1.5%.  On the 
other hand, Trident could buy a 90 -day call option for U.S. dollars, which would achieve the 
same thing.  
4. The Trident Company  could  borrow funds from a British bank. The 90-day loan rate in 
pounds is 14% Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ). 
Strategy  1: Trident  does nothing , and it exchanges funds using  the spot exchange rate. If 
the exchange rate does not change, then Trident will receive $ 5.286 million , computed  in 
Equation 2. Nevertheless, Trident has an exchange rate risk. If the British pounds appreciate, 
subsequently, Triden t will gain more U.S. dollars. On the other hand, i f the British pounds 
depreciate, then Trident receives fewer U.S . dollars.

1	݀݊ݑ݋݌ൗ ൱=$5.28	݊݋݈݈݅݅݉   (2) 
 
Strategy 2: Trident  enter s a forward contract. A forward contract is better  than a currency 
futures because the forward contracts are tailor made for amoun ts and do not require a margin 
call. Consequently, Trident does not have any exchange rate risk  because it locked into an 
exchange rate today.  Trident will receive $5.355 million in 90 days , calculated in Equation 3. 
Forward co ntract is better than  the fut ure spot exchange rate.

Strategy 3:  Trident buys the put option. I t pays  a premium,  $78,750, calculated in  Equation 
4 and insur ed its transaction for  an exchange rate of $1.75 per  pound. Thus, Trident does not 
have an exchange rate risk , and the option guarantees  at least $5.25 million , computed  in 
Equation 5 . Trident will only exercise the put if the British pounds depreciate , and the exchange 
rate fa lls below $1.75 per pound. Although the put option yields less revenue than the forward, 
Trident would buy the pu t option if it strongly believes  the British pound will appreciate . If the 
pound does indeed appreciate, subsequently, Trident sells its pounds  in the spot exchange 
market. Ho wever, if the pounds depreciate , then Trident  uses the put option to sell its pounds , 
preventing a loss .

Strategy 4:  Trident could borrow from a British bank. This strategy is more involved and 
entails no exchange rate risk. First, Trident borrows 2.899 million pounds today , calculated in 
Equation 6. Accordingly, the  British bank charges 14% interest and Trident will owe the bank 3 
million pounds in 90 days. Consequently, we use the present  value formula t o calculate the 
present value that grow s into the amount the British company will pay in 90 days.

Then Trident immediately transfers  the bank loan in U.S. dollars  today using the spot 
exchange rate. Conse quentl y, Trident receives $5.10 7 million today. Once the British company 
pays its accounts receivable, subsequently, Trident repays the British bank loa n. This transaction 
differs  from the first three strategies  because Trident receives funds today for an accoun ts 
receivable that the British company pays in 90 days. Although Strategy 4 yields the lowest 
amount, Trident receives money today that it could invest and earn interest wh ile Trident would 
wait 90 days until  receiving money for the first three strategies .

A company could use various strategies to re duce the exchange rate risk . For example, the 
U.S. company, Caterpillar,  bought a South Korean company for 6,030 million won s, due in 6 
months . In this case, Caterpillar has  an accounts payable. A specialist  at Caterpillar observ es the 
following strategies:  
 
1. Caterpill ar could  use the spot exchange,  1,200  wons per $1.  
2. Caterpil lar could enter a 180-day forward  contract with the exchange rate set at  1,260 wons / 
$1. 
3. Caterpillar could buy a 180 -day call option for won s with a strike price of  $1 / 1,200 won s 
and a premium of 3%. 
4. Caterpillar could deposit funds into a Korean bank and earn interest for 180 days. The 
Korean interest rate is 16% APR.  
Strategy 1:  Caterpillar  decide s to do nothing and pay its obligation using the spot exchange 
rate in six months.  Unfortunately, this strategy comes with an  exchange rate risk. If the Kore an Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
242 
 won appreciates,  subsequently, Caterpillar would pay more U.S. dollars to satisfy this 
obligation. If the spot exchange rate remains the same, then Caterpillar would pay $5.025 
million for the company , calculated in Equation 8 .

Strategy 2:  Caterpillar could use a forward contract to lock in a future exchange rate. 
Consequently, this strategy has no exchange rate risk , and Caterpillar would pay $4. 785 million , 
compute d in Equation 9. Clearly, Strat egy 2 is better than Strategy 1  because Caterpillar knows 
the exact future value of it s legal obligation.

Strategy 3:  Caterpillar could buy a call option to buy won s at a fixed price, and this 
strategy has no exchange rate risk. Thus, Caterpillar would pay the premium of $150,750 , 
calculated in Equation 10. Then Caterpillar  will exercise this call option  if the won appreciates 
relati ve to the U.S. dollar. Caterpillar would pay  $5.025 million  at most , computed  in Equation 
11. Although this Strategy is wors e than Strategy 2, Caterpillar w ould use this strategy if it 
believed  the Korean won would  depreciate, which  reduces  Caterpillar' s obligat ion. Then, if the 
Korean won  appreciate s, Caterpillar will exercise the call option.

Strategy 4:  Caterpillar could transfer funds today into South Korea using the spot exchange 
rate. Then it deposits funds into a Korean bank and earns interest for six months. Although this 
strategy has  no exchange rate risk, it does  have a country risk. Company deposits funds  in a 
foreign country for six months , and in some  countries, this would not be wise . We discuss a  
coun try's risk  in Chapter 20.  
Caterpillar needs 6,030 million wons in six months. We work backwards to determine the 
amount Caterpillar n eeds to deposit today, so the interest allows the balance to grow into 6,030 
million won s. We calcu lated the present value of 5,853.3 million won s in Equation 12. 
Consequently, Caterpillar uses today's currency exchange rate to transfer $4.65 million to Korea , 
calculat ed in Equation 13. This strategy yields the lowest costs to pay that accounts payable Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
243 
 because Caterpillar  deposit s funds  in a Korean ban k. In theory, it could deposit these funds in a 
U.S. bank to earn interest for six month s, and then  uses the other strategies.

In another example , Seattle Scientific sold equipment for 12.5 million  yen to a Japanese 
firm. Accounts receivable is due in 30 days. An analyst  at Seattle Scientific observes the four 
strategies:  
 
1. Seatt le Scientific  uses today’s  spot exchange  rate, 111.40  yen per $1  today . 
2. Seattle Scientific buys  a 30-day forward with a fixed exchange rate of 111.00  yen per $1. 
3. Seattle Scientific uses a 90-day forward rate  with an exchange rate of  110.40  yen per $1. 
4. The Japanese firm  pays cash today  if Seattle Scien tific would grant  a 4.5% discount.  
Strategy 1:  Seattle Scientific does nothing and uses the spot exchange rate. Unfortunately, 
this strategy entails an exchange rate risk. If the spot exchange rate does not change, then Seattle  
Scientific receives $112,208.26 , computed in Equation 14 . If the yen depre ciates relative to the 
U.S. dollar, subsequently, Seattle Scientific would receive fewer U.S. dollars.

111 .40	݊݁ݕൗ ൱=$112 ,208 .26   (14) 
 
Strategy 2:  Seattle Scientific uses a 30-day f orward contract and locks in t he future 
exchange rate. This strategy carries no exchange rate risk  and is better than Strategy 1 . Thus, 
Seattle Scientific receives $112,612.61 , calculated in Equation 15 .

111 .00	݊݁ݕൗ ൱=$112 ,612 .61   (15) 
 
Strat egy 3:  Seattle Scientific uses a 90-day forward contract. Again, this strategy has no  
exchange rate risk. Hence, Seattle Scientific rece ives $113,224.64 in ninety days , computed in 
Equation 16.  Although this strategy seems odd, Seattle Scientific would dep osit the money in  a 
Japan ese bank  for an extra 60 days , earning interest . Although Strategy 3 is  better than the first 
two strategies, t he analyst should  consider the time value of money , which was removed from Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
244 
 these examples making them easy  to understand. For example, o nce Seattle Scientific received 
funds from Japan in Strategies 1 and 2, it would deposit the funds at a U.S. bank to earn interest 
for two months. Thus, all these strategies would have the same time horizon  and thus be 
compara ble.

Strategy 4:  Seattle Scientific granted the 4.5% discount and receives its funds today. This 
strategy has no exchange rate risk because the firm transfers the funds to the U.S . today using 
the spot exchange rate. Consequently, Seattle Scientific receives $107,158.89 , calculated in 
Equation 17. This strategy  yields the smallest amount for the accounts receivable. Nevertheless, 
Seattle Scientific rece ives its funds today. Next, i t could invest these funds into a U.S. financial 
institution and earn interest for 90 days. An analyst  would need  to adjust the time horizon for 
this strategy, so it matches the time horizons for the other strategies. Strategy 3 set the greatest  
time horiz on at 90 days.

For t he last examp le, a company, Farah Jeans , plans to construct  a new factor y in 
Guatemala , and it owes  8.4 million quetzal s in six months , creating an accounts payable . Farah 
Jeans wants to reduce its exposure for this transaction. A specialist  faces  with the following 
strategies.  
 
1. Spot exchange rate equals  7.0 quetzal s per $1. Analyst believes the Guatemalan Central 
Bank will devalue the quetzal to 8.0 quetzals per $1. However, the analyst believes a small 
chance that the quetzal could strengthen to 6.4 quetzal s per $1.  
2. Farah Jeans could enter a 180-day forward  contract with an exchange rate of  7.1 quetzals  / 
$1. 
3. Farah Jeans  immediately transfer the fund s to Guatemala and earn the  interest rate 14% APR  
for 180 days.  
4. Farah Jeans could invest in the United States and earn  6% APR  for 180 days and the n use a 
forward contract to transfer  funds to Guatemala.  
Strategy 1:  Farah Jeans could use the spot exchange r ate to pay its account payable. 
Unfortunately, the spot exchange rate entails an exchange rate risk. In some cases, a cu rrency 
forecast is not accurate  because un anticipated events cause wild  fluctuations in currency Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
245 
 exchange rates.  If the quetzal does dep reciate, then Farah Jeans would pay $1,050,000 , 
calculated in Equation 18. However, if the quetzal appreciates, subsequently, Farah Jeans would 
pay out $1,312,500 , computed in Equation 19.

6.4	ݏ݈ܽݖݐ݁ݑݍൗ ൱=$1,312 ,500  (19) 
 
Strategy 2:  Farah Jeans uses a 180-day forward contract to hedge against the exchange r ate 
risk, thus ensuring no exchange rate risk. Farah Jeans would pay $1,183.098.59 , calculated in 
Equation 20.

Strategy 3:  Farah Jeans could i nvest money in Guatemala today and earn interest  for six 
months. Then th e company uses the funds to pay its accounts payable. Although this strategy 
does not have an exchange rate risk, the company could experience country risk. We work  
backwards and calculate the amount we need to deposit in the bank today, so it can grow int o 
8.4 million quetzals  in six months . We calculate d 7.85 million quetzals  in Equation 21.

Then Fara h Jeans transfer $ 1.121  million today to Guatemala using the spot exchange rate , 
computed in Equation 22. Unfortunately, this good  strategy has a different time horizon than the 
previous two strategies. If Farah Jeans has $1.121 million in its accounts, su bsequently, it could 
earn interest by depositing it in a U.S. financial institution and then use Strategies 1 or 2.

Strategy 4: This strategy addresses the time horizon  and has no exchange rate risk or 
country risk . Farah Jeans i nvest s funds in the United States today, and subsequently, uses a 
forward  contract  to transfer money to Guatemala in six months . Farah Jeans need $1,183,098.59 
in six months for  the forward contract,  computed in Equation 20. Then working backwards, th e 
company must invest $1,148,639.41  in the U.S. to earn the 6% interest for six months , 
calculated in Equation 23. Consequently, Farah Jeans would earn interest in t he United States Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
246 
 for six months and  use a forward contract to transfer funds to Guatemala  to pay off its 
obligation.

An international company could hedge natura lly and protect  its current contractual contracts  
in a foreign country  by using different strategies . First, a company has  both accounts receivables 
and accounts payable  in the same foreign country. If  they are roughly equal with similar 
maturities , then t he company uses the proceeds from the accounts receivable to pay its accounts 
payable  with no exchange rate exposure . Second, a company could  require payment in its home  
currency. For example, U.S. firms would require all payments are  made in U.S. do llars while 
companies in the Eurozone would require payments in euros. Thus, the  companies force the 
exchange rate risk upon the other parties . Finally, a company could require payment in Special 
Drawing Rights because the International Monetary Fund sets the va lue of the SDRs  to equal  a 
currency basket of  British pounds, euros, U.S. dollars, and Japanese yen.  
Measuring and Protecting against Economic Exposure  
Analysts have difficulties measuring economic exposure . A firm must  accurately forecast  
cash flows and exchange rates  because the  transaction exposure alters future cash flow s as the 
currency exchange rates fluctuate. If a subsidiary sees  positive cash flows after correcting for  the 
currency  exchange rates , then  its net transaction exposure is  low. Analysts  can estimate 
economic exposure accurate ly if currency exchange rates display  a trend , and they know future 
cash flows  with certainty.  
Some companies , for example, have an  unfavorable exposure . For example, PEMEX , 
Mexico’s Nationa l Petroleum Company,  has a  monopoly in the extraction, refining, and 
distribution of petroleum  in Mexico . Furthermore, PEMEX sells petroleum to the international 
markets. However, PEMEX does not have a favorable expos ure because it pays costs, 
denominated  in pesos while receives petroleum revenues,  priced in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. 
dollar depreciates, PEMEX's exposure causes its revenues to fall and its costs to rise, squeezing 
profits . 
An analyst measures the economic exposure by estimati ng a regression equation,  shown in 
Equatio n 24. Using a simple example , our  home country is the United States while Europe is the 
foreign country . Thus, the price,  P, is the foreign asset ’s price in U.S. dollars while S indicates  
the spot exchange rate,  defined as U.S. dollars per euro. Regression equation measures the 
association between the asset’s price and the exchange rate. We assume the  random error term , 
 equal s zero with a constant variance while  and  are the estima ted parameters. 
Consequently, t his equation estimates  a straig ht line between P and S with an intercept of  and 
a slope  of . We refer t he parameter  as the Forex Beta  or Exposure Coefficient , and it 
indicates the  exposure level . 
 Money, Banking, and International Finance

 ܲ=ߙ+ߚ∙ܵ+ߝ        (24) 
 
We can estimate the regression equation easily , and  we calculate   by using  Equation 25. 
Covariance measure s the variation of the asset’s price to the exc hange rate while the variance 
shows  the variation of the exchange rate. Consequently, two factors influence : the fluctuations 
in the exchange rate and the sensitivity of the asset’s price to changes in the exchange rate.

You, for example,  own and rent out a condominium in Europe . You hire a property 
manager who can vary the rent, ensuring  someone always rents  and occupies the property. We 
keep the example simple and assume  you receive 1,8 00 €, 2,000 €, or 2,200 € per month in cash  
for rent , shown in Table 1 . We refer to each rent as a state , and each rent could occur with a 1/3 
probability. We  also forecasted the exchange rate for each state, which is S. Then we calculate d 
the asset’s price , P, in U.S. dollars  by multiplying that state’s rent by the exchange rate .  
 
Table 1. Renting out your Condo for Case 1  
State  Probability  Rent ( €) Exchange Rate (S)  Rent (P)  
1 1/3 1,800 € $1.00 / 1 € $1,800  
2 1/3 2,000 € $1.25 / 1 € $2,500 
3 1/3 2,200 € $1.50 / 1 € $3,300  
 
We calculate  800 for  in this case. A positive  indicates your cash ren t varies  with the 
exchange rate  fluctuations , and you have  a potential economic exposure. Did  you notice , as the 
euro appreciated, the rent in dollars also increased? You could buy a forward contract for 800  € 
at a contract price of $1.25 per 1 € to hedge against the exchange rate risk.  This example works 
out nicely because we evenly spaced out the exchange rates , and the  middle exchange rate  
determines the  forward contract price . 
In Table 2, we show   is the correct hedge  for Case 1 . The Forward Price is the exchange 
rate in the forward  contract while the Exchange Rate is  the spot exchange rate for a  state.  We 
purchased a f orward contract with a price of  $1.25 per euro. If State 1 occurs, we gain from the 
exchange rate because the euro depreciated against the U.S. dollar. By exchanging 800 € into 
dollars, we gain $200 , and we compute it  in the Yield column in Table 2. If State 2 occurs, the 
forward rate equals the spot rate, so we neither gain nor lose anything. Finally, if State 3 occurs,  
the euro appreciated agains t the U.S. dollar, so we lose $2 00 on the forward contract . Since each 
state is likely to  occur , we, on average,  break even by buying the forward contract.  
We continue with the same example. However, your rents have changed in Table 3. In Case 
2, you could receive 1,667.67 €, 2,000 €, or 2,500 € per month in cash, and any rent is equally 
likely. Although your rent fluctuates greatly, the exchange moves in the opposite direction of the 
rent. Do you notice when you calculate the rent in dollars, the rent amounts equal the same Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
248 
 number, $2,500, and  equals -1,666.66 ? A negative   indicates the exchange rate fluctuations 
cancel out the changes in rent. Consequently, you can not use a forward contract in this case 
because you do not have economic exposure.  
 
Table 2. The  is the Correct Hedge  for Case 1  
State  Forward Price  Exchange Rate (S)  Yield  
1 $1.25 / 1 € $1.00 / 1 € (1.25 −1.00)×800  €= $200 
2 $1.25 / 1 € $1.25 / 1 € (1.25 −1.25)×800  €= $0  
3 $1.25 / 1 € $1.50 / 1 € (1.25 −1.50)×800 €= -$200 
Total    $0

1 1/3 2,500 € $1 / 1 € $2,500 
2 1/3 2,000 € $1.25 / 1 € $2,500 
3 1/3 1,666.67  € $1.5 / 1 € $2,500 
 
We, finally, examine the last case in Table 4. Y ou charge the same rent, 2,000  € per month 
for Case 3  regardless of exchange rate changes . Once you calculate the rent  in U.S. dollars, the 
exchange rate and rent amount move in the same direction. However , the  equals  0 in this case  
because the rent in euros does not vary. Consequently , you could hedge against the exchange 
rate risk by purchasing a forward for 2,000 € and not the amount for the . By deciding to 
charge the same rent,  you can  use a forward to protect this amount.

Condominium example was simple  but difficult to do in practice. Thus, international firm s 
can use five techniques to reduce its  economic exposure.  
Technique 1 : A company reduces  its manufacturing  costs by shifting  production to low -
cost countries. For example , the Honda Motor Company pr oduces high-quality cars, trucks, an d 
motorcycles  in factories,  located in  Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, 
Thailand, United States, and other countries. If the Japanese yen appreciates  relative to the other 
currencies  and raises Honda's production costs , subsequently, Honda  can shift its production to 
its other facilities , scattered across the world.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
249 
 Technique 2:  A company outsou rces its production or uses low -cost labor. For instance,  
many hotels and restaurants  opera te in extrem ely competitive markets  as they compete in prices 
to attract  consumers . Consequently,  hotels and restaurants,  located in countries with an 
appreciating currency rely on immigrants or even undocumented workers to reduce both its 
costs and prices . In another exa mple, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company,  is the largest electronics 
company in the world, and it produces electronic devices for some of the  world's largest 
corporations, such as the  Ipad, Iphone, Ipod, Kindle, PlayStation 3, and X -box. 
Techniqu e 3: A company can diversify its products and services by selling to consumers 
around the world. For example, many U.S. corporations produce and market fast food, snack 
food, and sodas in many around the world. Although the weakening U.S. dollar reduces  the 
companies' profits  inside the United States , their  foreign operations  offset the depreciating dollar 
and sustain their profits.  
Technique 4:  A company continually invests in research and d evelopment. Subsequently, it  
offer s innovative products that cons umers want. For instance, Apple Inc. set the standard for 
high-quality smart phones and tabl et computers. Although  Apple sells  its products in a country 
with a depreciating currency,  it possesses some monopoly power to raise its products' prices 
without reducing its sales.  
Technique 5: A company can use derivatives and hedge against exchange rate changes . For 
example, Porsche completely manufactures its cars within the European Union and sells 
between 40 to 45% of its cars to the United State s. The U.S. dollar was depreciating  against the 
euro until 2008. Consequently, the  depreciating U.S. dollar reduced its U.S. sales  while its costs 
rose. Th us, th e Porsche financial managers hedge d or shorted against the U.S. dollar, and some 
financial analysts estimated  50% of Porsche's profits came from its hedging activities.

 20. Political , Country, and Global  Specific  Risk s 
Political risk  originates from government because a  government  can impose its authority  
over an enterprise's  operations within a border or even outside  its borders . Once an international 
company or investor establishes a business within a foreign coun try, the host government 
enforces  its own laws, rules, regulations, and  taxes. Some governments view the foreign 
businesses or international in vestors unfavorably, and they punish the  business or exp ropriate 
the business's assets.  
This section examines the numerous risks a foreign business or investor could experience, 
and predict whether  to invest in a particular co untry. Some countries are pro -business, and 
international investors and businesses can invest there with little danger. Unfortunately, other 
countries are danger ous bec ause a government can interfere  with business investment, impose 
excessive taxes and reg ulations, or even nationalize investors' and businesses' assets. Thus, we 
examine a country's risk  in detail, and the meth ods the international investors  use to minimize 
their exposure to a country’s risk level. Furthermore, we study the met hods  to calcul ate a 
country's risk and the risk premium that we need  to compensate  investors  for the greater  
investment risk . 
Political , Country, and Global  Specific  Risks 
Political r isk comes in many forms. For instance,  firm specific risk , also called micro risk,  
is a foreign business and the host govern ment encounters  a conflict. Different firms experience 
distinctive risks. For e xample, a restaurant chain would experience a  different risk level than an 
electronics manufacturing  company . A restaurant chain leases its s pace and competes with 
numerous local businesses, whereas an electronics manufacturing facility requires billions o f 
U.S. dollars for investment. Moreover, t he officials in a foreign government will know about the 
electronics company well, but the restaura nt chain may not appear on the government’s  radar. 
Furthermore, a firm has a curren cy exchange rate risk, which we  discussed in Chapter 19. 
Although the exchange rate risk is a firm specific risk, a government  does not directly impose  
the risk  onto a business . 
A governmen t and foreign company could experience  conflicts over control of key 
industries or a foreign company infringes on national sovereignty. For example, a Dubai state -
owned company, Dubai Ports World, wanted to buy six U.S. ports  in 2006  that caused a political 
uproar in the United States . President Bush wante d to proceed  with the deal  while Congress  
block ed the deal. Although a British company owned the ports, Americans worried about 
Dubai's association with the Arab world , and  Arab ownership would lead to a rise in terrorism. 
Subsequently, Dubai World sold its interest in the ports to an American company, AIG.  
A government and foreign company could clash over local interests versus a foreign 
company's self-interests. Consequently, a government retains control ove r its defense industries 
and restricts ownership of production for  military equipment and supplies. If a government 
relied on a foreign country for military supplies, then that foreign country could withhold Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
252 
 exports as a mea ns of control  or as a bargaining chip . Moreover, a government restricts control 
over energy, communication, and agricultural industries. For example, Europe and the United 
States heavily p rotect its agricultural markets  because the political leaders are af raid a foreign 
country could withhold food exports as a means of control.  
A government could prevent international investment or stop foreign companies from 
entering and operating within the country. A government could use the Infant Industries 
argument to  protect its new, young domestic industries. For ins tance, the Unit ed States protected 
its manufacturing industries during  the 18th century , allowing  them to thrive and grow until they 
could compete with Europe. Consequently, a government hinders  foreign i nvestment or  restricts  
foreign enterprises  from  operating within its borders as a government protects  its own industries 
and companies.  
A government might  impose tariffs on its im ports. A tariff boosts the product’s  market price 
while  it reduces its import s. In some cases, g overnments  in developing countries  impose high 
tariffs  because the governments need the tax  revenue. Governments in d eveloping countries 
usually have tax evasion problem s, but they  retain  tight control s over their  air and seaports. 
Thus, they can collect tariff revenue as produ cts move through  the ports . Some foreign 
companies might  invest within a country to  circumvent  the trade barriers.  
A country could  join a trade bloc  with other countries, forming a free trade  zone. 
Accordingly, members of a trade bloc allow free trade between members while non -members 
face trade protection. Hence, a foreign compan y invest s within a country  to not only  circumvent 
a trade barrier,  but also gain more access to consumers  who live  within the trade bloc. For 
example, the North American F ree Trade Association (NAFTA),  a free trade zone between 
Canada, Mexico, and the United States , allow s free trade among members , but each cou ntry 
erects its own customs to  the outside world. The Europ ean Union  (EU)  is a common market, 
allowing  the free flow of labor, products, se rvices, capital, and money between  members, but the 
EU government erects a single customs to  the non -EU members. Consequently, foreign 
companie s have an incentive to invest ins ide the trade bloc gaining  more consumers.  
A government can  impose many condit ions on foreign companies, which  are: 
Condition 1:  A government forces foreign firms to use local companies, purchase local 
resources and supplies, and hire local labor. Furtherm ore, a government could restrict or limit  
the number of expatriates a foreign firm can hire. Usually, the foreign company hires expatriates 
from its home country for upper management and highly technical positions at the firm.  
Condition 2: A government cou ld be in a position where a foreign company has a pipeline, 
highway, or electrical  wires pass through the government’s  territory. Consequently, a 
government bargains for control by threatening to shut down operations. For example, Sudan 
split into two countries. South Sudan possesses and extracts petroleum while the petroleum 
pipelines pass through North Sudan to the sea ports. Thus, North Sudan can threaten to shut 
down the  pipeline and bargain for a portion of profits  from South Sudan . 
Condition 3:  A firm or government strives for control over the international markets. For 
instance, the members of the Organization of Pet roleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
nationalized and seized the petroleum companies that operated within their country. Then OPEC Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
253 
 operates as a cartel that imposes production quotas on its members. Production quotas reduce 
the petroleum supplies, boosting pe troleum prices and profits.  
Condition 4: A government requires the foreign companies to form joint ventu res with the 
government or  state-owned firms . Western firms bring investment, technology, and efficient 
management practices while the government retains control over the business activities. Joint 
venture is common in national defense, a griculture, banking, or the  mineral s industries, and 
governments in post-Soviet states,  Japan, Mexico, China, India, and South Korea  use it or have  
used joint ventures . 
Although politic al risk can be  difficult to predict, a country could exhibit char acteristics that 
endangers  investment. Characteristics include : 
Charact eristic 1:  A country often experiences changes in government leadership or a 
country has too many political parties. Unfortunately, government policies and laws quickly 
change. For example, many South American countries alternate between pro -business and 
socialist governments. During the pro -business phase, government relaxes taxes and regulations, 
and subsequently, the government s change their positions  during its socialistic phase  as they  
begin punishing  businesses. Moreover, political leaders with a stro ng nationalistic lean ing may  
view  foreign investment  unfavorably . 
Characteristic 2: International investors and business people can collect information about 
a foreign country's political leaders or a country's economic environment. Political leaders who 
believe in free markets and limited government are likely to pass favorable government laws 
and regulations to foreign investment. Some organizations such as the Heritage Foundation 
collect statistics on countries and attempt to measure the level of econom ic freedom. 
Consequently, economic freedom corresponds directly to business freedom and the level of 
interference by government.  
Characteristic 3:  Some countries are composed of fractious and contentious ethnic groups 
or plagued with religious  fanaticism. These countries are  poor choices for international 
investment. For example, B osnia and Herzegovina ha s three  ethnic groups: Bosnians, Croats, 
and Serbs. Each ethnic group occupies a specific re gion in Bosnia, and they do dis like each 
other. Furthermore, th e Bosnians are Muslims; the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are 
Orthodox Christians, and they fought the fierce Bosnian War during the early 1990s after 
Yugoslavia had broke n up into several countries . 
Characteristic 4:  Enterprises relocate to countri es with uneven income gaps. Enterpris es 
take advantage of the cheap  labor  force . Furth ermore, enterprises  hire the highly educated 
workers who become the high -income  group , widen ing the income gap. However , foreign 
investors  avoid  invest ing in a countr y wi th deteriorating  economic conditions. A country 
plagued with high levels of poverty and massive unemployment breed  protests, riots, and 
revolutions. Protestors could  associate the foreign investors with the government leaders, w hom 
the protestors want  to overthrow. Subsequently, the protestors and rioters  could  damage the 
foreign investors' assets. In extreme cases, the rioters and protestors could murder foreigners and 
tourists. As tourists and for eigners flee, a government would  see its revenue plummet.  
Investor s could face  country risk  that extends beyond political risk when  they invest  in a 
foreign country . We also call it macro risk. Government could impose rules, laws, and Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
254 
 regulations that hamper or interfere with free enterprise. For instance, a government could 
restrict a firm's ability to move funds into and outside of the country , called transfer risk . For 
example, a  government restricts capital outf lows because it cannot  attract investors to buy its 
government bonds. Thus, a government  could b lock funds and prevent foreign  firm from  
transfer ring funds  outside of a country, keeping  the investment within a country. A government 
could also prevent the convertibility of its currency. Financial analysts could view transfer risk 
as a micro firm risk  at the firm level, but macro risk that  applies to all firms in the country. 
Unfortunately, blocked funds reduce the present value of investments because a firm could have 
trouble selling its investment and assets, or transferring profits outside of a count ry. 
Religion could pose a problem for investing in  some countries. For example, all Musl im 
countries  following Sharia Law , except Turkey allow  the state and religion to overlap. Thus, 
they impose  restrictions on banking that  differs from the Western  bankin g systems. 
Furthermore , some Muslim countries discourage  women from  holding high manager positions 
in government and companies.  
Some countries are afflicted with severe corruption , and a business can experience 
corruption in four ways . First, businesses an d people bribe government officials fo r business 
licenses and permits  or overlook violations in the law. Second, government officials and 
enforcement officers may extort payments from businesses. They use threats, assess excessive 
fines, or penalize a business until the person pays their demand. Third, government officials and 
leaders may demand kickbacks from businesses. A kickback is a bureaucrat or politician 
secretly receives a portion of a government contract that they awarded to a bu siness. Thus, the 
kickback reward s a person  for granting the contract. Finally, nepotis m is usually a severe 
problem in corrupt countries because government agencie s hire  relatives and friends for high 
posts in government  and state -owned companies . 
Transparency International  publishes the Corruption Perception Index, where it attempts 
to mea sure a country’s corruption  level . Investors and business people should research a country 
thoroughly before investing  because investors could experience large losses from highly corrupt 
countries. Every  international investor should remember these f ive su ggestions . 
Suggestion 1: Investors and business people should avoid investing in a highly corrupt 
country  because they could lose the ir whole investment.  
Suggestion 2: Investors and business people should avoid paying bribes. Unfortunately, if a 
company pa ys a bribe,  then the bureaucrat or politician could return with great er demands. 
Subsequently, other agencies may demand bribes and kickbacks, once they discover a company 
had paid bribes.  
Suggestion 3: Court systems are usually  weak in corrupt countries, and the judges could be 
just as corrupt as t he bureaucrats and politicians. Even if a businessman and corrupt politician 
form a  verbal contract , judges might not enforce the  contracts  because corruption is illegal . 
Thus, the businessman has no legal recour se if the corrupt politicians change  the terms of the 
contract.  
Suggestion 4: A company or investor could experience bad public relations if a news 
reporter publishes the corruption.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
255 
 Suggestion 5: Corruption is  illegal within the corrupt country and usuall y a business's home 
country. Some countries like the United States could pursue criminal charges if it catches a U.S. 
business man involved in corruption in a foreign country.  
If business men or investor s ignore the five suggestions and still want to invest in a highly 
corrupt country, subsequently, they sho uld use a local advisor to handle the government officials 
and form friends and connections at high places.  
Multinational enterprises can use eight strategies to minimize political and country risk,  
which are:  
Strategy 1: A multinational company can  use fronting loans  to reduce its transfer risk . For 
example, a parent company deposits U.S. dollars (or euros) into an international bank in a safe 
country. Then the international bank lends to the subsid iary, located  in the foreign country. 
Usually, a government allows a foreign business to repay loans to international banks. If a 
governm ent prevents repayment, then the government hurts its  image, and the in ternational 
investors could avoid investing in  the country.  
Strategy 2 : An international corporation or investor can use leverage . Unfortunately, 
leverage has several meanings in finance. In our case, leverage means a firm or investor acquires 
loans without inc reasi ng its equity. Simply, a firm borrows heavily within the foreign country. If 
a firm experiences  a conflict wi th the foreign government and  exits the country, subsequently, 
the firm could default on its loans and obligations. Default could spark  a backlas h against the 
government, and this strat egy is effective if a government seizes or nationalizes an industry.  
Thus, the firm leaves the country and stops paying its loans.  
Strategy 3 : A firm artificially  create s exports to transfer  its funds  outside the country, 
minimizing  transfer risk. For inst ance, the military  in Burma had  overthrown  the government, 
and it had imposed  strong currency controls, preventing the outflow of currency from the 
country. Unfortunately, Pepsi produced  sodas within the country and could not  transfer its 
profits outside  because of government restrictions . Instead, i t bought beans with its profits;  then 
it exported and sold the beans t o foreign consumers recouping  its profits in U.S. dollars.  
Strategy 4 : Some firms have  barga ining power with government, called  special 
dispensation . Thus, a  firm could convince a government to transfer  funds  outside the country  or 
to demand exemptions . Companies specializing  in high tech industries, pharmaceuticals, and 
electronics have special dispensation. Many governments want these indus tries to operate within 
their borders  because these industries create  spillover effects . For example, these industries use 
skilled labor and strengthen a  country's image and prestige. Moreover, t he political leaders  view 
these industries vital  for economic  developme nt, and they relax rules,  regulations , and taxes  to 
attract these industries to th eir country. For example, the United States is suffering from a jobs 
crisis since the 2007 Great Recession. Economic recovery is slow, and job growt h has been 
weak.  Some firms  threatened to leave a state and take the jobs with them unless the state 
government reduces their taxes.  
Strategy 5 : A business could buy investment insurance from the home country or receive a 
government guarantee. Insurance covers any profits  that an investor loses from a project located  
in a foreign country. I nsurance could pay claims where  a foreign government has expropriated  
the busin ess, or the business experienced  a loss from a war, revolution, or  riots.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
256 
 Strategy 6: A business enterprise  could locate a small piece of  manufacturing  within a 
country.  Subsequently, the business produces goods in facilities spread across countries . 
Although this method increases the transportation costs, a company reduces its risk. If th e 
business loses its f actory  in one  foreign country, then the business only loses a piece of the 
business . For example, companies extract petroleum in Middle East and refine the petroleum 
products in the U.S. and Europe. Refineries cost  billions of U.S. dollars in investments , and 
many Middle Eastern governments could nationalize the industries. The Middle Eastern 
governments nationalize d the petr oleum industries in the 1960s when they  create d their state 
petroleum companies.  
Strategy 7 : A firm could use intellectual property ri ghts to protect its investment and assets 
in a foreign countr y. For instance, a firm control s its technology by owning rights to patents , 
trademarks, and brand names . In theory, a foreign government cannot operate the facility 
without permission from the h olders of the intellectual property rights. This strategy is effective 
when a company continually upgrades technology. Even if a government stole the technology, 
the technology becomes obsolete quickly. Although some countries do not enforce intellectual 
property rights, countries such as the Europe Union and  the United Stat es are forcing  countries  
to comply with intellectual property rights and are crack ing down on piracy and violations . 
Strategy 8 : A government could impose ca pital and exchange controls, preventing the 
outflow of capital. Companies  or investor s can reinvest their funds within the country if they 
cannot transfer funds outside the country and have no other options. Then they wait until they  
can transfer its funds out of the country. Usually,  international businesses do not invest in 
countries  with exchange controls,  and the exchange control could hamper  future investment.  
For the last type,  global specific risk  originates at the  global level. Firms have  no control 
over this risk, and it could  be difficult to predict. For example, the terroristic attack on the 
United States on Septemb er 11, 2001 raised awareness of  terrorism.  Unfortunately, terrorists can  
attack multinational enterpri ses in any country because terrorists associate them  with the ir home 
country.  Businesses  do not have t he resources to fight terrorism, and  they must depend on 
government. Nevertheless, terrorists are not the only global problems. Violent riots and protests 
erupted in Greec e, Spain, and the Middle East in  2011  as pro testors and rioters  destroy ed 
property and assets of multinational enterprises.  
Just in time inventory system that m any businesses have ado pted forms another global risk . 
Businesses hold low inv entories because they pay costs to store  parts and products. 
Consequently, businesses produce parts just in time as they are needed. Unfortunately, just in 
time invent ory systems are susceptible to  supply disruption s if parts come from many countries 
around the world. For example, the United States government closed borders and grounded 
airplanes on September 11, 2001, and Ford and other companies shut down becaus e they could 
not get parts. After  a tsunami and earthquake  had struck Japan in 2011, Japanese steel and auto 
parts companies  shut down, disrupting the parts  supply for the Japanese companies . 
Manufacturing plants across the world shut down because they could not get the necessary parts 
from Japan.  
Protests cause another global risk . For example, the protestors formed anti-globalization 
movement s against multinational corporations  and governments  because they are at the center o f Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
257 
 globalization.  Protestors  are angry  over the loss of jobs and increased competition with other 
coun tries. Finally, a cyber attack is similar to protests against governments and  corporations. 
Governments and business enterprises use large network s of computer systems  to store the data . 
Computer hackers can break into  these computer systems and steal or  destroy the data.  
Environmental issues create a  global risk  because environmental  regulations and programs 
raise a business’s  costs. Hence, a business could  relocate to countries with weak environmental 
laws, such as China  to reduce its production costs . Then the en terprises could pollute more while  
some of the pollution drifts to othe r countries through the air and water.  
Many corporations implemented corporate responsib ility to appease the protes tors and 
critics . Consequently, corporations claim they  do more than earn profits; they benefit the 
communities where they o perate. They clai m they  improve the  social, environmental, and 
economic co nditions  that surround the business . For example, Starbuck s pays a greater market 
price for coffee because the company wants to help the small struggling coffee farmers  in third 
world countries . Of c ourse, Starbucks  advertises this activity, enhancing its image . 
Measuring Country Risk  
Firms investing in foreign markets are exposed to a risk associated with that country. Thus, 
the investors and cor porations must keep watching  a country’s ever changing political and 
economic conditions. For instance, voters had elected socialists or na tionalists into a 
government that  begins seizing property. Consequently, the value of foreign investment and 
foreign assets could plummet in valu e as international investors and businesses flee the country. 
After  the people had elected Hugo Chavez as president in Venezuela, his government began 
nationalizing industries, causing an exodus of foreign capital.  Furthermore, a government could 
weaken pr operty rights or impose new taxes on foreign businesses. Finally, t he Russian debt 
crisis in 1998 and Argentina's international loan default in 2002 triggered the rapid decline of 
Russian and Argentina's assets after both crises.  
International investors,  buying foreign bonds, can experience a currency exchange rate risk, 
an interest -rate ris k, a borrower default, and/or a country risk . An investor experiences an  
exchange rate risk  because a country’s exchange rates are constantly fluctuating, changing an 
investment’s value . For example, an investor's investment would greatly plummet in value if a  
country's currency  had depreciated greatly . 
For an interest -rate risk, investor s observe  the interest rat e rises as  the bond's market price 
falls. Therefore, the ma rket value of a bond investment decreas es. Furthermore, the bondholder s 
do not earn the gr eater interest rate because they have  already purchased the bonds and locked in  
an interest ra te. 
Investors protect themselves from credit risk by increasing the  borrower’s interest rate . 
Consequentl y, the interest rate is comprised  of the risk -free interest rate and risk premium. Risk-
free interest rate  reflects  the market interest rate with a zero  default rate. For instance, t he 
investors consider U.S. government sec urities to be risk free  because the U.S. government has 
never defaulted on its debt, or at  least not yet. However, many investors are becoming  alarmed 
after the U.S. government  debt surpassed $17 trillion during  2013 . Investors believe t he U.S. 
government debt is risk -free because the U.S. government can increas e taxes or print money to Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
258 
 repay the  bonds. Fin ally, t he risk premium  reflects a borrower’s credit risk. If the borrower is 
likely to default on a loan, subsequently, the borrower pays a greater inter est rate , compens ating 
the investor for lending to a risky borrower . 
A credit risk is  a borrower does not repay  the principal and/or interest of a loan. 
Consequently, cr edit-rating agencies measure a borrower’s risk . For instance, Moody's and 
Standard & Po or's assign  the risk  level  for corpo rate and government's bonds with  a letter grade. 
Thus, a  higher grade implies a smaller default  risk, and  consequently,  the bondholders  would  
earn a lower interest rate.  
Analysts and economists measure a country’s risk s imilarly, applying t he same credit rating 
rules. Investors earn  smaller interest rate s for projects and investments in a foreign c ountry with 
a higher letter credit grade. Consequently, a project's rate of return is the country's  risk plus the 
rate of retu rn to  a comparable U.S. Treasury security. A comparable financial security ha s an 
identical maturity. Thus , a country's risk influences the interest rate on the debt issued by that 
country's government.  
For example, w e add a risk premium  to calculate the yield on Mexican government bonds. 
In this case, the risk premium reflects  the creditworthiness of the Mexican governmen t and not 
the country’s  risk for invest ing in Mexico. A country's risk embodies an entire country's legal 
and economic  environment  while this example only applies to the Mexican government . 
Accordingly, the yields on Mexican government debt should equal the return of a comparable 
U.S. government security plus a risk premium. Furthermor e, a credit -rating agency rated the 
Mexican government  a lette r grade of BBB that equals  a spread of 140 basis points (bps) . 
Spread becomes the risk premium, and  the 140 basis points equal 1.40%, or 140 ÷ 100 . If a 
comparable U.S. government bond has a 4% interest rate, subsequently, the yiel d for a 
comparable Mexican  bond would be 5.40%, or 4% +  1.40%.  
We show a  country’s cr edit rating and spread  in Table 1. As a bond’s m aturity lengthens, 
the basis points  spread  rises.  Consequently, the investors want an additional reward for waiting 
for the  longer time. Financial analysts and investors consider a country’s rating of BBB or better 
to be “investment grad e,” while they rate a BB or lower as  “junk.” Usual spread of junk debt 
ranges from 400 to 600 basis points over one -year U.S Treasu ry bills. Range could be  extremely 
wide with spreads over 2600 basis points.  
Country risk reflects the risk to a particular country by virtue of its location . Consequently, 
a country's risk differs  from a currency exchange rate risk. A country’s risk could be zero, b ut 
that country has a large currency exchan ge risk. Reverse could happen  but occurs  rarely. Thus, a 
country's risk reflects the negative influences of a country’s economic and political environment.  
Finan cial analysts use qualitative and quantitative appro aches  to measure cou ntry risk. 
Qualitat ive includes a country’s data  and experts’ opinions , who are politicians, union members, 
and economists. Furthermore, financial analysts monitor local radio, TV, newspapers, and 
embassy publications for information. Unfortunately, expert  opinions are subjective, but  an 
analyst can use experts' consensus to obtain a credit grade. Analysts would consider a country's 
historical stability and political t urmoil. On the other hand, the q uantitative  approach includes  a 
count ry’s data, and analysts compute a score from data. Quantitative appr oach “appears” being  
more objective because analysts calculate it from  data.  Money, Banking, and International Finance

Risk Rating Method , a quantitative approach , mixes  qualitative and qua ntitative measures. 
Using t his method , we compute  a weighted average of grades for four aspects of a country. An 
analyst grades each factor  from zero to 100. A high score indicates a low  country r isk while a 
low score implies high risk . Four factors are : 
 
 Economic Indicators (EI)  are easy to obtain and indicate a country’s financial condition. 
Economic Indicators include GDP  per capita, GDP growth rate, inflation, and interest rates. 
Investors are likely to  invest in a country with a strong GDP growth rate, low inflation rate, 
and stable interest rates.  
 Debt Management (DM)  indicates  a country’s ability to repay a debt and includes money 
growth, trade balance, foreign and domestic debt, and a government ’s budget deficit.  A 
country rapidly accumulating debt or experiencing massive trade deficits indicates future 
instability. Thus,  investors would  avoid investing in this count ry because  the government 
could impose taxes on investment, impose capi tal controls, or seizes assets if a crisis 
erupts . 
 Political Factors (PF)  are grades of political stability.  A high grade indicates a politically 
stable country , while a low grade  indic ates coups , violent protest s, and even  a revolution . 
This grade  include s experts’ opinions because  analysts do not have good quantitative 
measures for political stability.  However, if the measure were  good , a forecast c ould be 
wrong b ecause an election or revolution  brings  new leaders into power who  radically 
change the rules, regulations,  and economy.  
 Structural Factors (SF)  are socioeconomic conditions , such as  education  level , health care, 
and poverty  rate.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
260 
 We calculate a country's score,  x, by using  Equation 1 . Variable, w i, indicates a weight  
while  the score is one of the factors listed above . A weight is positive and range s between zero 
and one. For example, if an analyst weighs all factors equally, then every weight is set to  0.25, 
and a country's  score equals  the average of its four factors. Furthermore, the weights must sum 
to on e, which we show  in Equation 2. After  an analyst calculates a  country's score, the score  
always range s between zero and 100  because the weights sum to one. Finally, an an alyst could 
adjust the weights to reflect his or h er preferences. For instance, some  analyst s view debt 
management as an extremely important factor. Thus, they could assign a greater weight to this 
factor  and reduce the weights to the other factors . 
 
SF Scorew+PF Scorew+ DM Scorew+EI Scorew=x4 3 2 1    (1) 
 
11 =w+w+w+w4 3 2          (2) 
 
A country’s score lies between 0 and 100. I f a country possesses  a low  score, then analysts 
and economists would add a large  risk premium to the risk -free interest rate. Thus, a country’s 
basis points (bps) are greater for lower scores. Moreover, investors could adjust the weights and 
grades to reflect different time horizons. Therefore, the different weights yield distinctive risk 
forecasts for  short term, medium term, and long-term investment . For example , some  analyst s 
assign  more weight to debt management and political factors for short -term investments  while  
they assign  more weight to economic indicators and structural fact ors for long -term investments.  
The Risk Rating Method appears  objective  because  an analyst calculates a country's risk 
rating from  economic data.  However, the formula weig hts are subjective  because  an analyst  
select s the weights  arbitrarily . Consequently, this method is an art rather  than a science.  
International Credit Rating Agencies  
International credit -rating agencies  do not focus o n risk for particular companies  but 
assess  investment risk associated with countries . Risk reflects  the overall danger to international 
investors in investing in a particular country  because  every country  has a variety of institutions, 
laws, and customs . For example, you transferred money to  a Jamaican  company for a  coffee 
shipment.  Company eagerly acce pted your money, but it had failed to  deliver your  coffee.  In 
developed countries, you could sue a company to enf orce a contract, but Jamaica has  weak 
institutions, and, unfortunately, judges and magistrates may not enforce contracts. Investor’s 
legal opti ons vary by country.  Some countries , their government s im pose harsh rules, 
regulations, and taxes on businesses, imposing hardship on any business venture.  
Two well-known  credit agencies are A.M Best and Coface.  A.M. Best  is an international 
credit agency  that classifies country risk into five tiers . Scale uses Roman numerals and ranges 
from I to V with I being the lowest ri sk while  V being the highest risk.  Table 2 shows a  
country 's rating  for 2012 . A.M. Best assesses  country ri sk by analyzing  outside factors that can 
affect an insurer's control and  a country’s  ability to meet its obligations to its policyholders.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
261

Coface , France's export credit underwriter , is another international  credit -rating agency . 
Table 3  shows Coface’s 2012 rating of countries. The A1 category includes the lowest risk 
countries while  the D category entails highly risky countries . Coface off ers insurance to 
companies that deal  with foreign companies. If a foreign business defaults  on a payment to the 
insured company, then Coface would pay the insurance claim. Unfortunately, a fore ign company 
could suffer financial troubles from  bankruptcy, vi olent protests, revolution, or an international 
war. Co nsequently, companies pay greater  insuranc e premiums for insuring business 
transactions  with foreign companies located in high -risk countries.  Finally, Coface compiles a 
similar ranking scale for count ries’ business climate .

 Answers to Chapter Questions  
 
Answers to Chapter 1 Questions  
1. Purpose of financial markets and financial institutions is to connect the savers to the 
borrowers. Wealthy countries have developed financial markets. If the savers hide their 
money under the mattress, then they remove this money from the economy. Then banks 
cannot inject the savings  into an economy by  lending to  households and businesses.  
2. Financial institution s accumulate and analyze information about borrowers and their ability 
to repay  loans, which lower the  lending  risk to a variety of borrowers, and increases 
liquidity. Savers can easily convert their deposits into cash.  
3. Many assets are technically not mone y, but the public can easily convert them into money. 
Thus, some assets are good as money.  
4. A central bank uses the money supply to affect its economy. Goal is to keep an economy 
growing at a sustainable rate with a low unemployment rate and low inflation r ate. 
5. Three variables are inflation, GDP, and interest rates.  
6. Inflation is continual increas es in the average prices; GDP measures  the total amount of 
production of all goods and services within the econ omy. Finally, interest rates reflect  the 
borrower’s co st, but a benefit to the saver.  
7. Real means economists removed the impact of inflation  from the variable  while  nominal 
means inflation still influences a variable.  
8. Barter is inefficient  because  it does not allow people to specialize in the production of goo ds 
and services. Furthermore, it requires a large number of exchan ge ratios. P eople would  have 
considerable search costs to find each other, and  people could not store  perishable products . 
9. Money becomes a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account , and standard of 
deferred payment. Each function of money overcomes a problem with barter  and allows 
people to specialize in the production of goods and services.  
10. Seigniorage allows governments to create value out of thin air by minting coins. Seigniorage  
occurs when the face value of a coin exceeds the cost of minting the coin.  
11. Debit cards are electronic. They allow customers access to their deposits from anywhere 
within the United States and developed countries around the world. Checks allow people to 
exchange money through exchanging deposits at a bank. Checks are useful for large Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
265 
 transactions. Fiat money is paper money and is more  convenient to carry around than gold 
coins. However, a central bank can print as much fiat money that it needs. Finally, 
commodity money retains its value and has other purposes than as money.  
12. Transaction approach focus on any assets that are used as money in a transaction, while the 
liquidity approach defines any liquid assets as money. People can convert s ome a ssets to 
money  easily , so they are almost  money.  
13. M2 differs from M1 by  the small denomination time deposits and savings accounts. 
Differences between L, M3, M2, and M1 indicate the size of a co untry’s financial system. 
Large  differences imply a country has more developed  financial markets.  
14. Credit cards are loans from a bank or finance company. Of course, many people use credit 
cards as money, further complicating  the money definition even more.  
Answers to Chapter 2  Questions  
1. Bank deposits are liquid. Banks diversify their  loans as a way to reduce the risk. Finally, 
banks collect information about borrowers, s o banks know whom to lend, reducing  the 
default risk . 
2. Stocks are ownership of a corporation, while bonds are a loan to a corporation.  
3. Primary market is for newly issue d stocks and bonds, while the secondary markets allow 
investors to buy or sell their existing stocks or bonds. Dealers usually operate in the primary 
market , while the secondary market is an exchange.  
4. Presence of a secondary market increases liquidity. Thus, investors can sell their securities 
easily  if they do not want to hold them anymore.  
5. Financial disintermediation is depositors withdraw their deposits from financial institutions 
and invest directly into the financial markets  because  the financial ma rkets  offer a better 
return and/or reduce risks.  
6. Money market instruments include : U.S. Treasury bills (T -bills), commercial paper, 
banker’s acceptances, negotiable bank certificates of deposit (CDs), repurchase agreements, 
Federal Funds, and Eurodollars. Capital market instruments are Treasury notes (T -notes), 
Treasury bonds (T -bonds), general -obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and mortgages.  
7. Money market is for securities with a maturity less than one y ear, while the capital market 
includes  securities with maturities over one year.  
8. Stock has no maturity date  because  a corporation can theoretically live forever.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
266 
 9. A state bank has a charter from a state government, while a federal bank has a charter from 
the U.S. federal government.  
10. The Comptroller of the Curre ncy, FDIC, and the Fed regulate the national banks. A state 
bank could be regulated by one or more regulatory agencies, depending upon the state where 
the bank is located.  
11. The U.S. government wants a stable financial system  that protect s banking customers, 
encourage s homeownership, promote s efficiency in the intermediation process, and control s 
the money supply.  
12. The FDIC insures bank dep osits up to $250,000 per person  and not by  the account.  
13. The FDIC liquidates a bank’s assets and  refunds  the deposits to the depositors, or the FDIC 
finds another bank to merge with the failed bank. Then the FDIC will grant low -interest 
loans or buy the bad loans to make a bank merger more attractive.  
14. A bank run is depositors show up at their bank at once an d demand their deposits back. A 
contagion is one bank run leads to other bank runs, even for financially healthy banks. A 
financial panic is a wave of bank failures that push a society into  a severe recession.  
15. Countries repealed laws that allow internation al businesses to operate within their borders. 
Further more, growing incomes allow people and businesses to invest more funds into 
international markets. Finally, corpor ations and banks are global as  their activities spread 
across borders.  
16. A government want s a stable financial system and financial institutions to disclose acc urate 
information. Regulations help a central bank exert  more control over  monetary policy.  
17. First, a bank acquires stock in another bank, allowing it to cross a state line. Second, bank 
can issue commercial paper on itself and transfer funds between subsidiaries. Finally, banks 
could acquire nonbanks and enter other spheres of activity.  
18. A nonbank bank stops one function like accepting deposits or granting loans, thus it is no 
longer a ban k. Furthermore, Automated Telle r Machines allow customers to bank  at some 
distance from the bank, even in foreign countries.  
19. Banks offer MMDA while  financial companies  offer MMMF . Thus, the MMDA is covered 
by deposit insurance.  Money, Banking, and International Finance

 Answers to Chapter 3  Questio ns 
1. One person, the owner, is limited in the level of capital he  or she  can raise. However, 
corporations can issue stocks and bonds and raise millions or billions of dollars. Partnerships 
could raise some capital  because  two or more partners pool  their funds  together.  
2. Corporations can raise a substantial amount of capital, have limited liability, easily transfer 
ownership, continuity of life, and free from the mutual agency relationship.  
3. Corporation could issue preferred  stock or corporate bonds b ecause it  does not dilute the 
shares of the common stockholders.  
4. A common  fraud  is a subsidiar y hides a corporation’s debt and excludes the debt from  the 
corporation’s financial statements.  
5. Unfortunately, this was a bad investment. Your rate of return is:  
%3825$25$15$10025$5.0$100  = return  
6. If you had read the chapter carefully, the U.S. experienced a massive financial crisis in 2008. 
If you examined the U.S. financial sy stem, many business leaders became  ingenious at 
circumventing regulations.  
7. A bank as part of a Keire tsu can cause problems. When the Japanese economy e ntered into a 
two-decade recession  in the 1990s, the bank kept lending to its partners, even though it 
should  not have.  
8. You need to examine the incentives. C ounselor s want to maximize their salaries , so they 
enroll as many students as possible, e ven students who should  not enroll. University’s 
management wants the best, who possess  the drive and ability to finish their education.  
9. This is a case when investors use a euphemism to describe investment opportuni ties. 
Emerging economies wer e third -world countries. Would you invest i n an emerging market 
or a third -world country?  
10. A country could produce within the interior of a production possibilities curve. It means a 
society is not using all of its resources, such as unemployment.  
11. Company can circumvent trade barriers, has access to resources in China, could ask the 
Chinese government for tax breaks and subsidies, reduce economic exposure, and diversify 
its business. Furthermore, both labor and transportation c osts are cheaper. Finally, a bu siness 
in China could branch  to other cities  if the business experiences a strong demand for its 
products and services.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
268 
 12. Free trade is one country specializes in p roduction of a good  and then exports it to its trading 
partner.  Trading partner does the opposite;  so free trade is the mutual exchange of products. 
Outsourcing is one firm sends part of its production outside the country to reduce costs. 
However, the firm sells the cheaper product in its home country. A mutual exchan ge of 
products does not occur, and thus, outsourcing is not free trade.  
13. Bosnia would produce 500 units of tobacco, and 250 units of coffee. Colombia grows 250 
units of tobacco and 500 units of coffee. Thus, total coffee and tobacco production are 750 
units  each. If they engage in trade, Bosnia produces 1,000 units of tobacco  while  Colombia 
produces 1,000 units of coffee. Consequently, b oth countries gain  250 units  in production  
for both commodities  after trade . 
Answers to Chapter 4  Questions

banks can accept deposits in one country and lend to borrowers in another country.  
2. An offshore market is banks are located in countries with lax regulations, low taxes, and 
strict c onsumer confidentiality.

an existing U.S. bank, converti ng it into a subsidiary.  
5. Exchange rate risk is the change in the asset's value that is denominated in another currency. 
When the exchange rate changes, investors can gain or lose.  
6. Value of the loan is $100,000 or one million pesos. However, the loan drops in value to 
$66,666.67. Remember, the dollar appreciated while the peso depreciated. Thus, the 
investors come out ahead for investments denominated in appreciating currencies.  
7. Spot market is when the buyer and seller immediately exchange a commodity for money, 
while a derivative market is the buyer and sell agree upon a price today, but exchange the 
commodity for the money on a future date.  
8. A forward contract is a tailor -made contrac t that a bank usually issues. Buyer and seller 
agree to a price and quantity today, and they exchange the commodity and money on a 
future date.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
269 
 9. A spot against a forward is a particular currency swap. An investor buys currency today 
from a bank on the s pot market and  sells the currency back to the bank on a specific date in 
the future.  
10. A currency swap allows a corporation to invest in a foreign country by borrowing from its 
local bank. Then the company swaps its debt obligation with a foreign company to get the

13. Banking system connects all countrie s, but a government is limited in their regulatory 
power, when a bank’s business crosses a border. Countries have different deposit insurance, 
and regulations, and banks became skilled at circumventing regulation when entering the 
international markets.  
Answers to Chapter 5  Questions  
1. Brokers, investment bankers, and organized exchanges. For example, the New York Stock 
Exchange is an organized exchange, while bond dealers buy and sell government and 
corporate bonds. Finally, Lehman Brothers was an investment  bank that bankrupted during 
the 2008 Financial Crisis.  
2. The Dow Jones Average is an average of the top, blue -chip stocks on the New York Stoc k 
Exchange. Some stocks rise while other stocks fall . However, a market index shows a  trend 
of stock prices.  
3. A stoc k market crash occurs when  stock prices reach a peak and quickly plummet . People 
and investors hold stock as wealth. If stock prices fall too, then people's wealth disappears. 
Furthermore, some investors  borrowed to buy stock, and they cannot  repay  the loans. Thus, 
a stock market crash could lead to a financial crisis.  
4. Mutual funds and finance companies. For example, Vanguard offers mutual funds, while 
GMAC offers financing for automobiles.  
5. Adverse selection is a person knows he drives recklessly an d buys insurance to protect his

students only lose the value of their time at the university.  
Answers to Chapter 6  Questions  
1. Net income is $50,000 + $60,000 - $100,000 - $30,000 - $30,000, which equals -$50,000.  
2. Retained earnings are  $20,000 +$50,000 - $60,000 = $10,000. Do not include the sales of 
stock  because  stock transactions are recorded under the common stock account.  
3. Cash balance equals  $10,000  - $70,000 +$100,000 - $10,000 = $30,000. Do not include the 
accounts receivable because these are credit sales and the business did not collect cash.

Answers to Chapter 7  Questions  
1. Both a notes payable and corporate bond are loans to the corporation. However, a bond is 
standardized and allows investors to buy and sell them in the secondary mar kets, while a 
bank usually grants  a not es payable.  
2. Bonds are a liability that could  lower a corporation's tax burden. Furthermore, the 
bondholders do not vote at a corporation’s stockholders meeting and thus, do not compete 
with the stockholders over control of a corporation. Consequently, stoc kholders could earn a 
higher dividend  if a corporation uses bonds to expand operations.

7. Money market securities have maturities less than a year. Thus, when the interest rate 
changes, the money market securities swing less in market value as compared to the capital 
market securities.  
8. When the interest rate decreases, subsequently, the value of bonds becomes greater. Thus, 
you should buy bonds now and resell them for a higher price when the interest rate 
decreases. However,  if you are wrong, then you lose money, or you could  be holding onto 
the bonds for a while.

1. Six factors are wealth, expected returns, expected inflation, risk, liquidity, and information 
costs.  
2. Four factors are expected profits, business taxes, expected inflation, and government 
borrowing.  
3. Demand for bonds decreases and shifts left ward . Thus, both the bond price and quantity 
decrease. Furthermore, the bo nd interest rate should rise. 
4. Supply for bonds decreases and shifts left ward . Thus, the bond price increases while 
quantity decreases. Furthermore, the bo nd interest rate should fall . 
5. Demand for bonds increases and shifts right ward . Thus, both the bond price and quantity 
rise. Furthermore, the bond interest rate should decrease.  
6. During a business cycle, both supply and demand for bonds increase and shift right ward . 
During a recession, both the supply and demand for bonds decrease and shift left ward . 
Quantity is determinate  while bond prices, and thus bond interest rates are indeterminate.  
7. Real interest rate is -5% while  the approximation yields -10%, which causes  a large error.

8. If investors, businesses, and government expect higher inflation, then the supply  for bonds 
increases  while  investors purchase fewer bonds because inflation erodes the value of their 
investments. Businesses and government supply more bonds because they can repay the 
bonds with cheaper dollars. Thus, the  nominal interest rate rises . 
9. Loanable funds and bond market are opposites of each other. Loanable funds indicate the 
direction the money flows  while  the bond is the good. If investor s buy  a bond, they are  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

 supplying money, i.e. loanable funds. If a business issues bonds, then it demands money, i.e. 
loanable funds.  
10. World's interest rate is higher. Thus, investors would loan their surplus funds abroad to earn 
the greater interest rate.  
11. World's interest rate is lower. Thus, businesses and the government would borrow  the 
cheaper  funds from fo reign investors.  
Answers to Chapter 9  Questions  
1. Investors are usually  risk averse. Thus, investors increase their demand for the low -risk 
bonds and decrease their demand for the high -risk ones. Consequently, bond prices increase  
for the lower -risk bonds bu t decrease for the higher -risk bonds. Furthermore, the interest 
rates are lower for the low -risk bonds and higher for the high -risk bonds.  
2. Investors prefer to hold liquid securities. Thus, investors increase their demand for the 
highly liquid bonds and de crease their demand for the low liquid ones. Consequently, bond 
prices incr ease for the liquid bonds but de crease for the non -liquid bonds. Moreover, the 
interest rates are lower for the liquid bonds and higher for the non -liquid bonds.  
3. Investors prefer to  invest in securities that entail low information costs. Thus, investors 
increase their demand for the low information cost bonds and decrease their demand for the 
high information cost ones. Consequently, bond prices increase for the bonds with low 
inform ation costs but increase for the high information cost bonds. Furthermore, the interest 
rates are lower for the bonds with low information costs and higher for the other bonds.  
4. Investors prefer to invest in securities that have lower taxes. Thus, investors  increase their 
demand for the tax -exempt bonds and decrease their demand for the taxed ones. 
Consequently, bond prices increase  for the tax -exempt bonds but de crease for the taxed 
bonds. Moreover, the interest rates are lower for the tax -exempt bonds and higher for the 
taxed bonds.  
5. Term structure of the interest rates is an entity offers a large variety of securities with 
different interest rates. Thus, the securities have the same risk, liquidity, information costs, 
and taxes. However, the interest rates still differ with long maturity interest rates tend to be 
higher than shorter maturities.  
6. Three theories are segmented markets theory, expectations theory, and preferred habitat 
theory. Segmented markets theory is investors prefer to invest in specific bon d markets, and 
each bond market has its own supply and demand. Expectations theory is for investors to 
invest in longer -term securities; they exp ect the interest rate to be great er, causing a 
positively sloping yield curve . Preferred habitat theory is inve stors prefer a certain bond. Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
275 
 However, they are persuaded to invest in a longer -term security if they receive a higher 
interest rate, the term premium. Preferred habitat theory does the best  in explaining the yield 
curve.  
7. When a yield curve has a negative s lope, the investors are pessimistic about the future, and 
the economy usually enters a recession a year later.  
Answers to Chapter 1 0 Questions  
1. Liabilities are demand deposits, savings accounts, small and large -denomination time 
deposits, borrowings, discou nt loans, and federal funds (if the bank borrowed funds). Assets 
include  vault cash, deposits at other banks, deposits at the Federal Reserve, loans, and 
bank’s physical assets like its buildings and computers. Capital reflects  a bank’s net worth.  
2. A bank’s  net worth equals  bank’s total assets minus total liabilities. Investors want a positive  
net worth  because  the stockholders receive assets  if the bank is liquidated.  
3. Liquidity risk is the risk that depositors show up at the bank and withdraw too much at on e 
time. Consequently, the banks must use good management to meet depositors' withdrawals.  
4. Something severe happens to a bank that causes total liabilities to exceed total assets.  
5. Banks use credit risk analysis, collateral, credit rationing, and restrictive  covenants to reduce 
adverse selection. Furthermore, banks could foster a long -term relationship with their 
customers.  
6. Housing bubble popped, causing housi ng prices to plummet. If a bank  foreclose s on a home 
that is losing value, then too many foreclosures cause total liabilities to exceed total assets.  
7. Banks split their assets and liabilities into long term and short term. Then banks scrutinize 
the short -term assets and liabilities  because  if the i nterest changes, subsequently, it 
immediately impacts these assets and liabilities. Banks can develop strategies, whether a 
bank manage r believes interest rates will rise or fall . 
8. Floating rate debt is loans with a variable interest rate. If the interest r ate increases, then 
borrowers must pay more interest  on their payments . 
9. Securitization is the bundling of illiquid assets like mortgages into a fund. Then this fund 
allows inves tors to invest in it. A fund  offer s different tranches with different credit ra tings 
and rates of return.  
10. This is really  a tough question. If banks retained  their rigid lending standards and the credit -
rating agencies accurately rated the CDOs and ABS, then the housing bubble would still Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
276 
 form  but at a slower rate . The Great Recession  would  still have  occurred , but the effects 
would not have been as harmful and severe.  
Answers to Chapter 11  Questions  
1. The Fed's assets are the discount loans and holdings of  U.S. government securities  while its

7. Currency -to-deposit ratio represents  the portion of money held by the public as currency. An 
increase in wealth, higher interest rates, lower risk from  bank failures, and an increase in 
illegal activities will decrease this ratio . 
8. This occurred during the 2008 Financial Crisis. The Federal Reserve granted $2 trillion in 
loans. However, the banks held onto this money and did not increase loans. Thus, the 
multiple deposit creation ceased to work. Purpose of the bailout was to get the U.S. banking 
system to start lending  again.  
9. Banks and the public can thwart a Fed's action by changing the ir behavior. Banks can hold  
excess reserves  while  the public influence  the currency to deposit ratio.

Answers to Chapter 1 2 Questions  
1. The Fed’s assets include  securities, discount loans, Items in the Process of Collection 
(CIPC), Gold Certificates, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), coins, buildings, and foreign -
currency reserves. The Fed’s liabilities are currency outstanding, deposits by depository 
institutions, U.S. Treasury deposits, foreign and other deposits, Deferred Availability Cash 
Items (DACI), Federal Reser ve float. The Fed’s net worth equals  total assets minus total 
liabilities.  
2. Go through the T -account transactions for the checking writing process by c hanging the 
amount of the check.  
3. Float changes in December and April. People buy Christmas presents in December and pay 
their taxes in April. Anything could affect the float  if it slows down the mail, such as bad 
weather or a transportation strike.  
4. A rise in the float increases  both the monetary b ase and money supply . 
5. The Treasury Deposit increa ses the Fed's liabilities, shrinking  both the monetary b ase and 
money supply . 
6. If the banks reduce the amount of discount loans, the n the Fed's assets fall, decreasin g both 
the monetary b ase and money supply . 
7. The Fed cannot control the U.S. Treasury deposits, the float (CIPC - DACI), gold 
certificates, SDRs, and foreign government deposits.  
8. The U.S. Treasury does not influence the monetary base or money supply by chang ing taxes 
or issuing more U.S. securities, as long as  it sells the securities  to the public.  
9. The Fed tries to stabilize interest rates. If the U.S. Treasury issues too much debt, then the 
interest rate increases. Thus, the Fed must  purchas e these U.S. secu rities to lower the interest 
rate. Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
278 
 10. Developed countries like the Uni ted States and Europe want strong currencies . It attracts 
foreign investors. China a nd the Asian tige rs maintain weak currencies , boosting  their export 
industries. A weak currency creates j obs and wealth.  
11. A weak dollar means $1 can purchase fewer foreign currencies, while a strong dollar means 
$1 can buy more foreign currencies. If the U.S. dollar is strong, subsequently, the U.S. 
customers buy more imports  while the U.S. export industry shi ps and sells fewer goods to 
foreign countries. Strong dollar makes foreign produc ts cheaper, and U.S.  products become 
more expensive. Consequently, the U.S. trade deficit worsens.  
12. As the Federal Reserve buys or sells foreign currencies, the Fed' s assets an d liabilities 
change . Thus, the monetary base and money supply changes. Unsterilized transactions do 
not offset the change in the money supply when the Fed intervenes in the foreign exchange 
market, wh ile sterilized transactions,  the Fed uses open -market o perations to offset any 
potential change in the money supply as  it intervenes in the foreign exchange market.  
Answers to Chapter 1 3 Questions  
1. The Federal Reserve has 12 Federal Reserve banks.  
2. Each region of the country is economically different. Thus, each  Federal Reserve Bank  
tailors its services for each unique region. Furthermore, the power of a central bank is 
dispersed among the 12 Fed banks.  
3. The Federal Reserve System has 12 Fed banks. Every national bank must  purchase stock in 
its regional Fed bank a nd can vote for three directors from the banking. Furthermore, the 
Board of Governors can choose three direc tors and approves the choice  of the Fed's bank 
president. Finally, businesses can elect the last three directors.  
4. The Board of Governors manages the Federal Reserve System. The Board has seven 
members who m the U.S. President appoints with Senate approval.  
5. The Fed raises its own funding independent of the U.S. government. Moreover, the members 
of the Board of Governors have staggered terms, so one President cannot change the entire 
board at once. Finally, the U.S. government cannot completely audit the Fed.  
6. The Federal Open Market Committee puts monetary policy i nto action. They determine 
open -market operations, while the Board of Governors controls  the FOMC.  
7. Chairman advises the President and informs Congress on Fed's actions. Finally, the financial 
analysts pay close attention to the chairman’s policies and speeches.  
8. Consequences could be disastrous  because  the country reverses the gains for a sing le 
currency. For example, the Greek government has severe budget problems, where the Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
279 
 government cannot balance its budget, and investors do not want to invest in Greek bonds. 
Public believes if the Greek government reintroduces the drachma, then the govern ment will 
devalue as it creates money to cover budget deficits . Consequently, the Greek citizens 
started a run on the banks to withdraw their savings in euros before the Greek government  
convert s currency  to drachmas.  
9. The Executive Board implements moneta ry policy, while the Governing Council determines 
monetary policy.  
10. Euro reduces exchange rate risk, reduces transaction costs, and promotes competition within 
the Eurozone. However, an EU country loses control of its monetary policy. Moreover, the 
prices a re high relative to incomes in southern Europe, and the European Central Bank is 
prohibited to help EU countries, such as buying a country’s bonds.   
11. Public interest view is a government agency actually solves a problem that it was created to 
solve. Princip al-agent view is a bureaucracy serves its own self -interest and may not perform 
the actions a government  created  it for. 
12. Countries with independent central banks usually have very low inflation rates.  
Answers to Chapter 1 4 Questions  
1. The Fed creates a higher demand in the bond market. Thus, the bond's market price rises  
while  the interest rate falls. The Fed injected reserves into the banking system, expanding 
the money supply . 
2. The Fed increases the supply in the bond market. Thus, the bond's price fall s while  the 
interest rate rises. The Fed removed reserves from the banking system, contracting  the 
money su pply. 
3. If the Fed  increase s the money supply by 3%, it must  buy enough U.S. Treasury securities to 
achieve this goal. However, the Fed buying the secu rities from the bond market decreases 
the interest rate . If the Fed concentrated on the interest rate, it must buy or sell bonds to 
achieve the target interest rate. Nevertheless, the buying or selling of bonds changes the 
bank reserves, and hence, the mon ey supply.  
4. A REPO is a repurchase agreement. The Fed temporarily buys a U.S. government security, 
and the seller will buy it back on a specific date in the future. A reserve REPO is the Fed 
sells a U.S. government security and agrees to repurchase it on a particular date in the future. 
REPOS inject reserves into the banking system  while reverse REPOs remove reserves 
temporarily . Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
280 
 5. A defensive transaction  offset s unexpected changes in the money supply like bad weather 
slowing down the check clearing process. A  dynamic transaction is the Fed implements  
monetary policy as specified in the general directive.  
6. The Fed has complete control over the quantity of securities it can buy or sell . Thus, it can  
change the money supply by a little or a lot, easy to correct mi stakes, an d implement 
monetary policy  quickly.  
7. If the Fed decreases th e discount rate, then the Fed encourages  banks to borrow more from 
the Fed. A lower discount rate is expansionary monetary policy  because  it could inject more 
funds int o the banking system, expanding  the money supply. If the Fed raises  the di scount 
rate, subsequently, it implements  contractionary monetary policy.  
8. The Fed could grant adjustment credit, seasonal credit, or extended credit.  
9. The Fed could audit the bank more, could impose  fines on the bank, or stop lending to a 
bank.  
10. The Federal Reserve cannot force banks to accept loans. The Fed could lower t he discount 
rate, but banks might  not increase their borrowings  from the Fed.  
11. When the Fed conducts monetary policy, the policy affe cts the federal funds rate first. If the 
federal funds rate rises, then the Fed may be pursuing contractionary monetary policy. If the 
federal funds rate drops, subsequently, the Fed may be using expansionary monetary policy.  
12. Changing the reserve requireme nts changes the money multipliers. Thus, even a small 
change in the reserve requirement could have a large impact on the money supply.  
13. One benefit is  the government could eliminate  deposit insurance. Banks would hold all 
deposits. Furthermore, the money mu ltipliers will be one, and the Fed has  exact control over 
the money  supply. However, this stops banks from being  financial intermediaries. They 
connect savers to borro wers. Banks are critical to finance mortgages and lend  to businesses 
and households.  
14. The Fed's goals are price stability, high employment, economic growth, financial market and 
institution stability, interest rate stability, and foreign -exchange market stability.  
15. Information, administrative, and impact time lags. Economy could be leaving a rec ession. 
By the time monetary policy influences an economy, the economy is already growing, and 
the monetary policy c auses the economy to grow quickly , creating inflation.  
16. Although the Fed has six goals, it cannot control them. However, the Fed uses targets  
because it has better control over them and in turn, the targets influence the goals.  Money, Banking, and International Finance  
 
281 
 17. Monetary policy has an immediate impact on operating targets like the federal funds rates 
and non -borrowed reserves. Over time, monetary policy influences the intermedia te targets. 
Operating and intermediate targets differ by Fed control and time lags.  
18. The Fed must accurately measure the targets and exert control over them. Furthermore, the 
target must  respond to monetary policy predictably , and the target influences the Fed's goals.  
19. The Fed's monetary policy coincides with the business cycle. Thus, monetary policy causes 
the economy to grow faster during a boom cycle, and slower during a recession. Monetary 
policy  is supposed to do the opposite  and smooth out the business  cycles.  
20. Economists suggest other targets, such as nominal GDP, yield curve, commodity prices, and 
U.S. dollar exchange rate.  
Answers to Chapter 1 5 Questions  
1. Purpose of the balance -of-trade accounts is to account for money flows between one country 
and the  rest of the world. Economists classify m oney flows into categories that allow them  
to analyze patterns in the cash flows.  
2. Current account includes exports and imports, services and insurance for transportation, and 
gifts. Financial account keeps track of investment into real estate, stocks, and bonds. Finally, 
the official settlements account represents  the intervention of the central bank.  
3. Statist ical discrepancy account occurs  from errors, omissions, and unreported activities. 
Unreported activities include tax evasion, hiding money from government, or profits from 
illegal activities.  
4. Three exchange rate regimes are the gold standard, the Bretton Woods System, and flexible 
excha nge rates. Gold standard creates a fixed exchange rate system by setting  a weight of 
gold to a currency's value. The Bretton Woods System was a gold standard that allowed 
countries to adjust their exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar  while  the U.S. do llar 
became  fixed at $35 = one ounce of gold. Finally, the flexible exchange rate regime allows 
supply and demand of currencies to determine exchange rates.  
5. World Bank lends  to developing countries,  helping them invest in their infrastructure, such 
as new roads, dams, electric power plants, etc.  
6. The IMF helps countries finance a balance -of-payments deficit. The IMF has a cache of gold 
and foreign currencie s that it can lend . 
7. Balance -of-payments deficit causes a surplus of currency on the international exchange 
markets. Thus, that coun try’s central bank must buy  its currency using official asset Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
282 
 reserves. If the country refuses to use reserves or devalue it s currency, then black markets 
would form for its currency.  
8. If a country devalues it currency, subs equently, the impact does not immediately reduce a 
trade deficit.  A country’s imports continue rising  while  its exports fa ll after a devaluation 
and then improves after a time lag.  
9. Country has too much money flowing into the country. Consequently, the cent ral bank 
increases the money supply and  reduces the inter est rate . International investors slow down 
their investm ents in the country that reduces the financial account . 
10. Capital flight is similar  to a bank run on a foreign country. International investors cause a 
massive outflow of capital  as they cash in their investments. A capital flight could lead to the 
collapse of a country’s currency. In vestors use four methods to transfer  money out of the 
country: bank transfers, money laundering, false invoicing fo r imports and exports, or 
converting money into precious metals.  
11. This will be a very bad day indeed. If the U.S. dollar collapses in value, then the paper 
wealth of anyone holding dollars will disappear. Furthermore, the foreigners would  stop 
investing in the U.S. economy and the U.S. government debt. T hen trade could halt as 
nations and people stop accepting dollars for  payment  unless investors find a replacement 
international currency.

4. Supply for U.S. dollars comes from people holding U.S. dollars , and they trade those dollars 
for another currency. A demand for currency in one market automatically creates a suppl y of 
currency in another market  as people exchange currencies. Finally, a central bank could  
expand the supply of U.S. dollars.  
5. Americans buy fewer  Mexican made goods. Thus, the demand for pesos falls and shifts 
leftward . Consequently, t he peso depreciates while the U.S. dollar appreciates , causing 
Mexican imports to decrease while exports increase . 
6. The Federal Reserve must  reduce the supply of U.S. dollars. It can tr ade e uros for U.S. 
dollars, causing the U.S . dollar to appreciate and the e uro to depreciate. However, the 
Europea n Central B ank can nullify this  by purchasing the supply of euros with U.S. dollars. 
Hence, the Federal Reserve bought U.S. dollars off th e currency exchange markets while  the 
European Central Bank injects new U.S. dollars in their place . 
7. Foreign investors  reduce their d emand for U.S. currency, shifting the demand function  
leftward . Furthermore, U.S. investors  invest in other countries for a higher interest rate. As 
they convert their U.S. dollars into another currency, the supply function for U.S. dollars 
increases. Consequently, t he U.S. dollar depreciates  while  the market quantity of U.S. 
dollars becomes  ambiguous.  
8. Lower demand for the Uzbek som causes the som to depreciate against the U.S. dollar. The 
Uzbek central must reduce its som on the currency exc hange markets by purchasing som 
with its official reserves. Supply for som decreases and shifts left ward , returning the som to 
the original exchange rate.  
9. Japan  has a low risk of capital flight. Most of the Japanese debt is held internally, and 
internation al investors have few investments in Japan. Consequently, if the Japanese 
government defaulted on its debt, the crisis would most likely remain inside of Japan.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

immediately. A forward transaction is a buyer buys a contract today for an asset that is sold 
in the future for a fixed price. Then the seller is obligated to sell the buyer the asset for the 
contract price.  
2. Derivatives obtain their value from the asset that is specified in the contract.  
3. Investors use hedging to protect themselves from future volatile prices. Speculators , on the 
other hand , buy and sell securities to earn quick profits. As you guessed, speculators can 
earn large profits or massive losses from the derivatives mark et. 
4. Once an investor buys a futures contract, the buyer is obligated to buy the asset at the 
specified price (i.e. long position), while the seller is obligated to sell the asset at the 
specified price (i.e. short position).  
5. Asset's price will fluctuate daily on the spot market. If the difference between the asset price 
and contract price exceeds a threshold, either the buyer or seller must deposit money with 
the broker. Margin helps guarantee parties will honor the contract . 
6. Issuer deposits  000750 75 150 000110 ,$=$ $ ,   with the exchange  because  the holder can 
buy petroleum via the futures and sell it on the spot market for a massive profit  if the futures 
matured today.  
7. Value of th e contract on the spot market equals  150,000
11150,000 $=
euro$euro . Value of 
the futures contract is $100,000
1.51150,000 
euro$euros . Investor pays only $100,000 by 
using the contract, instead of $150,000. Thus, the issuer deposits money into the margin 
account.  
8. Futures is a contract.  Both the buyer and seller are obligated t o carry through with the 
transaction.  With the options contract, the holder  choose s to exercise it  or not . Kenneth R. Szulczyk  
 
286 
 9. A call options give the right to the contract holder to buy an asset a t the stated price, while 
the p ut option gives  the holder the right to sell  at the price in the contract.  
10. An option's premium is affected by t he volatility of an asset's price o n the s pot market, the 
magnitude  of the strike  price, the  maturity of the option, and interest rates.  
11. Your premium equals: 0005 10 00010.5 ,$= , $  . You cou ld exercise the option and pay $75 
for petroleum or buy the petroleum from the spot market at $50. Consequently, you would 
buy the oil from the spot market.  
12. Premium equals : 100 100001 0.01 $= $ . Farmer could sell his corn for $6 per bushel on the 
spot market, or exercise the put option and sell his corn for $5 per bushel. Thus, f armer 
would sell his corn to the spot market.  
13. Problem with the derivatives based on the stock market index or the volatil ity index is no 
commodity , or financial instrument is t raded. Instead, the investor gambles  on future index 
numbers. Unfortunately, the company issuing the index derivative could have a massive 
exposure  if the stock market rapidly drops during a financial crisis.  
14. Credit Default Swaps are a form of insurance. Issuer guarantees payment if a mortgage f und 
or company bankrupts, causing  their bonds to plummet in value.  Thus, risk -averse investors 
commit  to speculative grade investments if they can buy this insur ance.  
15. We could not avoid t his crisis . However, the impact could have been less severe. 
Government could tighten laws that forced mortgage companies to verify homeowners' 
income. Government could pass laws that prevented the layering of CDS contracts.  
16. Coupo n payments are $1.5 million and 2.2 million e uros respectively. Implicit exchange rate 
is $1.5 million ÷ 2.2 million e uros, which equals $0.682 per e uro. Present value s of the cash 
flows are:

 Answers to Chapter 19 Questions  
1. Transaction exposure is the impact on current transactions, such as accounts receivable and 
accounts payable in a foreign country when the exchange rate changes. Economic exposure 
is fluctuating exchange rates affect expected cash flows over time. Translation exposure is 
the change in a company's consolidated financial statements because accountants use 
different exchange rates to convert accounts into t he domestic currency. Finally, changes in 
exchange rates influence  a firm's cash flows, revenues, and costs, and thus, it affects a 
company's taxes.  
2. This is not  a good situation because you earn revenue fro m sales in pesos while you pay 
costs in dollars. Thus, the transa ction exposure is your costs rise while your revenues fall . 
Economic exposure is the impact of an appreciating U.S. dollar on your business over time, 
and in this case, you would expect your profits to fall over time.  
3. You calculate d your gain fro m this transaction  below:  
ݐ݂݅݋ݎ݌= $1	݊݋݈݈݅݅݉ቀଵ	€
.ଶହቁ−500 ,000	€=300 ,000	€  
 
A fluctuating exchange only impacts the revenue while your hotel's costs remain constant. 
Thus, your profit would fluctuate between 180,000 and 420,000 euros, computed below:  
݁ݎݑݏ݋݌ݔ݁= $1	݊݋݈݈݅݅݉( 1±0.15)ቀଵ	€
.ଶହቁ−500 ,000	€=[180 ,000	€,420 ,000	€]  
 
4. First, the company has an exchange rate risk. If the exchange rate does not change, then the 
company receives $4. 5 million . 
Second, the company el iminates the exchange rate risk  and pays $5 million.  
 
Third, the company borrows 4,938,271.60 CD today , and  it would transfer $  4,444,444.44  
today  using the spot exchange rate . 
 
Fourth, the company receives $ 4,365,000 today . 
 
5. First, the company has an exchange rate risk. If the exchange rate does not change, then the 
company receives $45,454.54.  
Second, the company eliminated the exchange rate risk, and it will pay $ 41,666.67.  
 
Third, the company needs 495,458.30  pesos  to de posit today , and  it would transfer 
$45,041.66  today  using the spot exchange rate . 
 
Fourth,  premium equals  576.92  while the company is guaranteed a minimum of $38,461.54.  Kenneth R. Szulczyk

6. The Forex Beta  measur es the  economic exposure and  is a parameter estimate of a li near 
regression equation. It has  two sources of variation: F luctuations in the exchange rate and 
the sensitivity of the asset’s price to changes in the exchange rate.  
7. First, company could locate its production in countries where it sells it backpacks, trying t o 
equal accounts payable and accounts receivable. Then it uses accounts receivables t o offset 
its accounts payable. Second, company can shift its production to low -cost countries, 
especially in countries that weaken its currency.  
Answers to Chapter 20 Questions  
1. A firm only invests and operates a small portion of its production in a foreign country. If a 
firm has a conflict with the government, then only that portion of the production facility is in 
jeopardy. Furthermore, if a company continually updates  its technology, subsequently, it 
could use intellectual property rights to protect its technology. In theory, the firm could deny 
the government to use its technology. Finally, a firm could use leverage, where it heavily 
borrows from banks within the fore ign country. If the firm has a conflict with the 
government, it can exit the country and default on its bank loans.  
2. A government  protects its agricultural, defense/military, energy, and communication 
industries. These industries are critical for a modern, functioning society, and a supply 
disruption could cause a severe crisis within the country.  
3. A firm cannot transfer its profits outside a country because the country imposed capital 
controls. Thus, a firm could buy a local product and export the product to  recoup its profits 
abroad.  
4. Special dispensation is government grants exceptions and favors to industries it wants, such 
as pharmaceutical, high -tech, electronics, and computers. These industries are prestigious 
and lead to a rise of skilled and educated l abor force.  
5. Average basis points for the CCC grade are 450. Thus, you add 4.5% to the 5%, yielding 
9.5%.  
6. The Risk Rating System is a method to measure a country risk. The Rating System uses four 
measures: Economic Indicators, Debt Management, Political Fac tors, and Structural Factors. 
We measure each factor  on a scale from zero to 100. A country's score is a weighted average 
of the four factors. Although this method appears to be objective, the weights and measures 
of some factors are subject ive. Money, Banking, and International Finance

 7. Qualitativ e measures rely on experts’ opinions. Unfortunately, experts h ave biases and 
opinions that  taint their opinion. Quantitative measures use a variety of statistics and 
demographics of a country. Then a n analyst computes  a country's score . 
8. Hong Kong is politi cally stable, and A.M. Best rated it Tier II while Coface rated it A1.  
9. Ukraine is a former republic of  the Soviet Union that implemented  little market reforms. 
A.M. Best rated the Ukraine as a Tier V while Coface rated it a D.

Text extracted from D:\4-1\AI\Lab\Assignment_01\MMK_Task_02\search_api_lesson\download2.pdf:
Behavioural economics and behavioural finance are rapidly expanding fields that are 
continually growing in prominence. While orthodox economic models are built upon restrictive and simplifying assumptions about rational choice and efficient markets, be -
havioural economics offers a robust alternative using insights and evidence that rest more easily with our understanding of how real people think, choose and decide. This insight -
ful textbook introduces the key concepts from this rich, interdisciplinary approach to real-world decision-making.
This new edition of Behavioural Economics and Finance is a thorough extension of the first 
edition, including updates to the key chapters on prospect theory; heuristics and bias; time and planning; sociality and identity; bad habits; personality, moods and emotions; behavioural macroeconomics; and well-being and happiness. It also includes a number of new chapters dedicated to the themes of incentives and motivations, behavioural public policy and emotional trading. Using pedagogical features such as chapter summaries and revision questions to enhance reader engagement, this text successfully blends economic theories with cutting-edge multidisciplinary insights.
This second edition will be indispensable to anyone interested in how behavioural 
economics and finance can inform our understanding of consumers’ and businesses’ de -
cisions and choices. It will appeal especially to undergraduate and graduate students but also to academic researchers, public policy-makers and anyone interested in deepening their understanding of how economics, psychology and sociology interact in driving our everyday decision-making.
Michelle Baddeley  is a behavioural economist and applied economist based at the Uni -
versity of South Australia’s Institute for Choice in Sydney. She is an Honorary Professor 
with University College London’s Institute for Global Prosperity, Associate Researcher with the Cambridge Energy Policy Research Group and Associate Fellow with the Centre for Science and Policy, University of Cambridge. She has also worked with policy-makers across a diverse range of themes and her research brings economic insights from applied economics, behavioural economics, behavioural finance and neuroeconomics to multi -
disciplinary studies.Behavioural Economics

For this second edition of Behavioural Economics and Finance , I would like to reiterate my thanks 
to all those who supported and advised me for the first edition. My gratitude to the Rout -
ledge commissioning editors for encouraging me to consider a second edition. Very many 
thanks to Anna Cuthbert, Cathy Hurren and Maire Harris and all those on the Routledge production and copy-editing teams for their great work on the second edition – especially to Cathy Hurren for stepping into the breach when production schedules were looking unfeasible .
Thank you also to my co-authors Wolfram Schultz, Philippe Tobler and Christopher 
Burke, for permission to use some of the images from our publications, and also for the opportunity to collaborate with them in some exciting neuroeconomic analysis. My grat -
itude also goes to the Leverhulme Trust, who generously sponsored our neuroeconomics research. 
I had a lot of positive feedback on the first edition and thank you to all those col -
leagues, students and others who enjoyed the first edition and found it useful. If I had not had an enthusiastic response to the first edition, I would not have been inclined to write a second edition. Last, but not least, my thanks to friends and family – especially to my parents for their unstinting support and my husband, Chris – for his patience, good humour and  moral support especially as book-writing has taken up a lot of my time and 
energy over the past few year s.Chapter 1
Introducing behavioural economics
What is behavioural economics?
With the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in economics to behavioural economist  Ri chard 
Thaler – one of the pioneers in developing behavioural public policy  “nu
dging”  –  be
havioural 
economics is very much in the news. There are, however, many misconceptions about be -
havioural economics, which raises the question: what is behavioural economics?
This is a question that many behavioural economists have worked on answering, 
for example see Hargreaves-Heap (2013) versus Thaler (2016) for some contrasting per -
spectives. To give a quick and simple answer: behavioural economics is a fascinating and 
fashionable subject, of increasing interest to policy-makers and business, as well as to a range of academic researchers and teachers. But, because it is such a broad field, it can be difficult precisely to define. Some would argue that all economics is behavioural eco -
nomics because economics is about behaviour, albeit in a restricted context. Others would define behavioural economics very narrowly as the study of observed behaviour under controlled conditions, without inferring too much about the underlying, unobservable psychological processes that generate behaviour.
Overall, the clearest way to describe it is as a subject that brings together economic 
insights about preferences and decision-making with broader principles of behaviour from a range of other social, behavioural and biological sciences. In this, behavioural economics relaxes economists’ standard assumptions to give models in which people decide quickly, often using simple rules of thumb rather than rigorously but robotically calculating the monetary benefits and costs of their decisions. Behavioural economics also explores how quick thinking leads people into systematic mistakes but also explains how people can learn from their mistakes. In behavioural economic models, people look to others when making decisions and when seeking happiness. Their decisions are affected by skills and personalities and also by moods and emotions. People aren’t necessarily good at planning systematically for future events and particularly when immediate pleas -
ures tap into emotional and visceral influences. This means that people will be susceptible to impulsive decision-making which may be detrimental to their long-term welfare, for 2 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
example  smoking  and eating unhealthy food. So overall, behavioural economics develops 
more traditional economic models to explore in more depth and detail the balancing acts 
that we go through every day when we choose and decide. For the purposes of this book, behavioural economics will be defined broadly as the subject which attempts to enrich economic analyses of behavior – grounded as it is in theories about preferences, incen -
tives, decision-making and strategy – with insights from psychology, sociology, cognitive neuroscience and evolutionary biology.
a quick history of behavioural economics
Whilst behavioural economics might seem like a relatively new sub-discipline of eco -
nomics to some, in fact economists have been working on themes that we might today categorize as ‘behavioural economics’ for as long as economics has been around. His -
torically, economics had many links with psychology but as mathematical tools were used to simplify and structure economic theory, the subject moved away from psy -
chological analysis. Also, with the increasing focus amongst economists on quantita -
tive styles of decision-making, psychology’s focus on subjective motivations did not rest easily with economists’ focus on objective, analytical, mathematical methods of capturing economic decision-making via the observation of what people choose and decide. Economics went through something like a behavioural “dark age” – in which key insights from other social sciences were lost – until the major resurgence of behav -
ioural and psychological economics in the 1980s and 1990s. In understanding why, it is useful to explore the historical development of behavioural economics and some of the behavioural approaches that preceded economics as we see it today – from David Hume in the 18th century through to Hyman Minsky in the 20th century. For a quick potted history see below, but more detailed accounts include Kao and Velupillai (2015) and Heukelom (2014).
David Hume (1711–1776)
Early analyses of economic psychology focused on the moral dimensions of decision-  
ma
king. David Hume wrote with optimism of a society in which all people were 
benevolent:
If every man had a tender regard for another … the jealousy of interest … could no 
longer have place; nor would there be any occasion for … distinctions and limits of property and possession … Encrease to a sufficient degree the benevolence of men … and you render justice useless … ’ tis only from selfishness and the confin’d generosity 
of men … that justice derives its origin. 
(Hume 1739, pp. 547–8)
The role of the market in solving economic problems might be more complex than Hume 
suggests but the psychological forces of benevolence and philanthropy can be justified if there are market failures such as externalities and free-rider problems. Benevolence does imply some sort of interdependence amongst people’s utility and this is something that standard economic analyses of independent, atomistic agents cannot capture but it is a theme that has received a lot of attention in modern behavioural economics.a qUIC k  H ISto rY oF B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS  3
adam Smith (1723–1790)
Adam Smith is widely attributed with founding the subject of economics (not entirely 
accurately) and he too was interested in the social and psychological dimensions of behav -
iour, even if his interests in these areas are not apparent in the caricatures of his thinking. Whilst his name is popularly associated with his rhetorical justification of free markets and the accompanying metaphor of the Invisible Hand of the price mechanism coordinating individual behaviour in socially beneficial directions, as described in An Inquiry into the Na -
ture and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), Adam Smith also thought carefully about socio-
 
ps
ychological motivations. One key theme in his writings is the impact that social emotions 
have on our choices – foreshadowing a number of areas in modern behavioural economics, particularly models of social influence. In The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) he emphasizes the importance of imaginative sympathy in human nature: “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him” (Smith 1759, p. 9).
Adam Smith foreshadowed the importance of sentiment in modern behavioural eco -
nomics, with his emphasis on social, unsocial and selfish passions – focusing on the importance of vividness in events in determining how strongly we respond to them. Linking with modern analyses of bad habits and inconsistent plans he analyses self-deceit and the impact of customs and fashions – which are also the focus in modern behavioural economics analyses of social influences and group bias. Vernon L Smith (1998) notes that whilst on first inspection there may seem to be a contradiction between Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations , emphasizing self-interest, and The Theory of Moral Sentiments , emphasizing 
sympathy – in fact these concepts can be reconciled if cooperation and noncooperation can both be understood in terms of a “self-interested propensity for exchange” in friend -
ships as well as markets.
Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832)
Most famously, Jeremy Bentham was the founder of utilitarianism. He analysed a range of behavioural and psychological drivers of human action, especially the impacts of pleas -
ures and pains. His conceptions of utility were focused on the balance of pain and pleas -
ure and formed the basis for the emphasis on utility in modern economic theory. If welfare, utility and happiness are quantifiable, then right and wrong can be measured by reference to the greatest happiness principle: the greatest happiness for the greatest num -
ber. This principle has flaws in that it assumes happiness to be objectively quantifiable and easily aggregated, implying that people’s utilities are separable. One focus in behavioural economics is on unravelling what happens when utilities are not easily separable.
A second Benthamite principle – of psychological hedonism – was conceived as a guide 
for legislators, focusing on the assumption that people maximize their own self-interest. For Bentham, pain and pleasure are the “sovereign masters” motivating what we do (Har -
rison 1997). Something is good if the pleasure outweighs the pain; it is evil if the pain outweighs the pleasure. Legislators can formulate rewards and punishments to exploit this psychological hedonism principle and thereby promote the greatest happiness principle (Harrison 1997). Bentham emphasized the quantification of happiness and developed a he -
donic calculus – a detailed taxonomy ranking key features of pleasures and pains. Bentham’s emphasis on happiness has its parallels in today’s happiness and well-being literatures.4 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923)
Vilfredo Pareto is probably best known by economists for his mathematical rigour, his 
concept of Pareto efficiency and his influence in general equilibrium theory. Less well known is that he developed an interest in social psychology later in his career. He spent time specifying the nature of social relationships, foreshadowing modern behavioural analyses of social influence. In Trattato di sociologia generale (1916; translated to “The Mind and Society” in 1935), Pareto explored a range of behavioural/psychological influences and divergences between logical and non-logical conduct, focusing on feeling, residues (instincts) divided up into classes to explain individual differences and derivations (log -
ical justifications) – paralleling the dual processing models seen in modern behavioural economics. He also recognized the importance of diversity in skills: in describing cycli -
cal sociological forces, he explores how intergroup conflicts mirror a struggle between foxes and lions, adopting Machiavelli’s distinction between cunning foxes and coura -
geous lions. This links to the idea in modern behavioural economics that there are dif -
ferences amongst people – a challenge to the conventional economist’s assumption of 
 ho
mogeneity  – that is that all people behave in the same way, on average at least.
Irving Fisher (1867–1947)
Irving Fisher is renowned for his early analyses of investment and interest rates and the balance between impatience to spend and opportunities to invest. He sets out the impa -
tience principle in which the rate of time preference , what modern economists call the discount 
rate, captures the fact that interest is the reward for postponing consumption. These ideas 
about balancing present versus future pleasures and rewards form the bedrock of mod -
ern analyses of inter-temporal decision-making (Fisher 1930, Baddeley 2003). However, 
 Fi
sher’s analysis of this principle suggests subjective, psychological motivations are driving 
choices. The “inner impatience” of consumers is balanced against “outer opportunities” for rewards from interest. Thaler (1997) emphasizes Fisher’s focus on “personal factors” as determinants of time preference. Fisher presciently explores the idea that time pref -
erence is affected by individual differences in foresight, self-control and willpower, and factors reflecting social susceptibility to fashions and fads – all ideas developed in modern behavioural economics. Thaler also argues that Fisher’s analysis of money illusion is an -
other illustration of a way in which Fisher foreshadowed modern behavioural economics because it is a form of bias consistent in the analyses of Kahneman, Tversky and others. Fisher’s explains sluggishness in the adjustment of nominal interest rates in terms of peo -
ple’s confusion about the difference between real and nominal values. This also links with Akerlof and Shiller’s (2009) identification of money illusion as one of the animal spirits constraining rational decision-making, as we will explore in Part III of this book.
John Maynard key nes (1883–1946)
John Maynard Keynes was one of the 20th century’s great thinkers about economics – and he made key contributions to economic policy too – especially in the sphere of macro -
economics. The economists we have met so far focused mainly on the microeconomics of 
 be
haviour – how individual “agents” – people and businesses – make their decisions. 
When it comes to macroeconomics, capturing psychological and social influences on a qUIC k  H ISto rY oF B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS  5
economic behaviour is much more complex – but these are themes that John Maynard 
Keynes was keen to explore. He focused on some key psychological drivers of behaviour and in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money , Keynes argues that economic and fi -
nancial decision-making is driven by a series of fundamental psychological laws: the pro -
pensity to consume, attitudes to liquidity and expectations of returns from investment. Keynes applies his psychological analysis most clearly when analysing the interactions between the players in financial markets and the macro economy. Short-termist specula -
tors, preoccupied by a thirst for liquidity , are driven by social influences and conventions 
to “beat the gun” and “outwit the crowd”. Thus, speculation becomes similar to parlour games such as Snap, Old Maid and Musical Chairs – in all these games, the winner is the person who says “Snap” just in time – neither too early nor too late.
Like Adam Smith, Keynes also strongly emphasized the role of emotion and sentiment 
in economic decision-making. In a world of fundamental uncertainty, judgments will rest on flimsy foundations, introducing fragility into macroeconomic and financial sys -
tems. Keynes argues that whilst a social view of economic progress requires a long-term view, longer-term outlooks cannot rest on strictly rational grounds because in a world of uncertainty it is rational for profit-seekers to focus on the short term. Paradoxically, it is the emotionally-based animal spirits of entrepreneurs that propel the far-sighted behav -
iours necessary to justify sufficient capital accumulation for sustained economic growth (Keynes 1936, pp. 161–2) – as we will explore in more detail in later chapters of this book.
For Keynes, economic behaviour is the outcome of a complex mixture of the rational 
and psychological/emotional. This fits with modern neuroeconomic models in which behaviour is the outcome of a complex interaction of emotion and cognition. There are further parallels: Keynes’s ideas about herding, reputation and beauty contests are resur -
facing in modern models of behavioural economics including literatures on herding, social learning, reputation, beauty contests and animal spirits; for examples, see Bhatt and Camerer (2005), Camerer (1997, 2003b) and Ho, Camerer and Weigelt (1998) on beauty contests, learning and reputations. Keynes’s dual focus on reason and emotion also fore -
shadows the focus in neuroeconomics on interacting systems in the brain, for example Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2004) assert that animal spirits are a reflection of the interaction of deliberative and affective systems.
Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950)
Joseph Schumpeter was born in the same year as Keynes and his analyses of macroeco -
nomic influences rivalled Keynes’s contributions – but he had a different conception of the drivers of macroeconomic fluctuations, focusing particularly on entrepreneurs as the heroes of the capitalist system.
Foreshadowing the modern emphasis in behavioural economics on the importance 
of social influences in driving corporate behaviour – for example, via corporate social responsibility initiatives . Schumpeter focused on the idea that entrepreneurship is driven 
by social forces but nonetheless is essential to the success of a capitalist economy. Social influences drive not only the 
 ou
tward-facing publicity initiatives of businesses, they also 
lead businesses to copy each other.
In Schumpeter’s analyses, an innovative entrepreneur will bring a new idea to the mar -
ketplace and this will attract hordes of imitators – or “imitative swarms” – each seeking 6 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
to emulate industry leaders. But as each new imitator joins an industry, the opportunities 
for new profits from new opportunities will reduce as the swarm of imitators grows too large. In this way the business cycle is driven by socio-psychological influences. At the time he was writing, Schumpeter’s insights were groundbreaking but have only recently found their way into modern behavioural analyses of business behaviour.
Friedrich von Hayek (1899–1992)
One of Keynes’s intellectual adversaries was Hayek but Hayek too had a keen interest in the psychological and behavioural motivations underlying decision-making. In The Sensory Order (1952) Hayek analyses the nature of mind and distinguishes two “orders” via which 
we classify objects into the phenomenal and physical: the subjective, sensory, perceptual order versus the objective, scientific order – what von Hayek referred to as the “geograph -
ical” order.
This division mirrors the focus in modern behavioural economics and neuroeconom -
ics on interacting neural systems, for example Kahneman’s (2003) separation of an intu -
itive System 1 from a reasoning System 2 in maps of bounded rationality. Hayek (1952) also analyses in detail the processing of stimuli and the biological aspects and characteris -
tics of the nervous system to construct a theory of mind in which the mental order mir -
rors the physical order of events seen in the world around us. His assessment of modern behavioural economics would probably be damning however because he concludes that “human decisions must always appear as the result of the whole of human personality – that means the whole of a person’s mind – which, as we have seen, we cannot reduce to something else” (Hayek 1952, p. 193).
george kato na (1901–1981)
George Katona’s early work on economic psychology inspired some economists to return to psychological analysis. Katona (1951, 1975) uses ideas from cognitive psychology to analyse how individuals learn from groups; he distinguishes between different forms of learning, for example between the mechanical forms of learning such as the 
 “s
tamping-in” 
of simple rules of thumb and heuristics versus learning via problem-  so
lving and under -
standing (Katona 1975, p. 47). Behaviour is not about understanding deeper processes and direct experience of problems but instead is about relying on simple observation of others to acquire information.
Developing socio-psychological themes, Katona argues that group forces and group 
motives are important, reflecting not only imitation and conscious identification with a group but also group-centred goals and behaviour. Imitation and suggestion reinforce group situations and group coherence but are not necessary conditions for being part of a group. Reference groups provide standards for behaviour and group-centred belonging and motivation are more likely to be important in small groups. Katona (1975) argued that people prefer shortcuts and follow simplifying rules of thumb and routines, foreshadow -
ing the “fast and frugal heuristics” analysed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) and oth -
ers, as explored in Chapter 3. Individual differences of opinion are ignored and similarities in small parts of information are transmitted to large numbers of people. 
 Soc

norms, attitudes, habits, and group membership will all influence decisions. Discussion of BEHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS: W Hat ’S nEW?  7
beliefs with friends and associates will mean that the groups to which a listener belongs 
determine the information selected. Social learning will continue until the majority has a uniform belief system (Katona 1975).
Hyman Minsky (1919–1996)
Hyman Minsky was one of the pioneers in extending Keynes’s insights about socio-  
ps
ychological forces in the macroeconomy specifically into the impact of these influences 
on the financial system. His ideas have become much more popular in the aftermath of the 2007 /8 sub-prime mortgage crisis and the subsequent global financial crises and recession because he outlines a powerful intuitive account of what might have contrib -
uted to this instability, and particularly the role played by emotions and self-fulfilling 
 pr
ophecies – key elements in his “financial fragility hypothesis”.
Minsky’s financial fragility hypothesis is about how emotional influences destabilize 
financial structure. He argued that boom phases are characterized by excessive  opt
imism  – 
leading to over-lending and  over-investment – creating pressure on financial systems and 
the macroeconomy. A tipping point is reached when entrepreneurs, investors and finan -
ciers start to realise that their optimism is misplaced and the euphoria of the boom phase is replaced by pessimism and fear. Interest rates rise, debt burdens become unsustainable, banks withdraw finance, businesses tip into default – with impacts spreading to the “real” economy – that is, to employment and production. In this way, emotions feed the cycle and contribute to financial fragility – within economies and the global financial system more generally too, as we shall explore in more detail in Parts II and III of this book.
Behavioural economics: what’s new?
Now that we have explored some of the history of behavoural economic thought, we can turn to modern economics to explore how and why behavioural economics is dif -
ferent from standard approaches – specifically the dominant approach associated with neoclassical economics – which focuses on the role played by rational agents in market economies. Neo-classical economics is sometimes notorious for its focus on unrealistic behavioural assumptions about humans’ capacity for rationality. This translates into the -
ories that are founded on mathematical principles – reinforcing the idea that economics treats people as if they are mathematical machines. Nonetheless, economic theory has the distinct advantage that it is analytical and relatively objective. The power of behav -
ioural economics comes in combining more realistic behavioural assumptions – which we shall introduce in this book – with some of the analytical rigour of economic theory. Many would envisage behavioural economics and neuroeconomics as providing concep -
tual alternatives to standard neoclassical models which focus on a conception of people as Homo economicus – people are assumed to be clever and well-informed, decision-making 
is rational and systematic; and economic actions are described as the outcome of me -
chanical data processing. A lot has been done to soften the standard approach, especially in microeconomic analysis, for example by recognizing the nature and implications of asymmetric information and other forms of market failure, and by introducing Bayesian models to replace models of rationality based on perfect information. These extensions can explain non-maximizing behaviour by allowing it to be constrained by uncertainty 8 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
and/or affected by strategic interactions between people and firms. Behavioural econom -
ics is another way to illuminate some of the deeper foundations of sub-optimal behaviour.
The degree of divergence between behavioural economic models and standard ne -
oclassical models does vary across behavioural economics. Some would see behavioural 
economics as basically consistent with standard neoclassical approaches, with some extra psychological variables embedded, for example into utility functions, to increase realism, though at some cost in terms of tractability. For example, Camerer, Loewenstein and 
 Ra
bin (2004) argue that behavioural economics
increases the explanatory power of economics by providing it with more realistic psy -
chological foundations … [This] does not imply a wholesale rejection of the neoclassi -
cal approach … [which] provides economists with a theoretical framework that can be 
applied to almost any form of economic (and even noneconomic) behavior.
(Camerer, Loewenstein and Rabin 2004, p. 3).
A further complexity is that behavioural economics does draw on insights from many of 
the other “tribes” of economic theorists: not all “non-behavioural” economists are neo -
classical economists and there are some particularly strong parallels between behavioural economics and evolutionary economics, social economics, institutional economics and heterodox economics. In drawing on insights beyond neoclassical economics, other be -
havioural economists take a more radical approach and would argue that the foundations of neoclassical economics are badly flawed and need to be replaced with a more funda -
mentally psychological approach to analysing economic decision-making. Earl (2005) sets out some axiomatic foundations for psychological economics but emphasizes that these can be expressed “permissively” as tendencies describing what people often do, rather than as “non-negotiable axioms”. Choices will be fickle, susceptible to random influences and context, for example with fashions and fads. Consumer and workplace behaviours may be pathological to some degree, including dysfunctional strategic decision-making and extreme behaviour including impulsive spending or obsessive -compulsive behaviour. 
Some may exhibit these behaviours to a large degree; others in a minor way but it will mean that our economic decisions will be affected by irrational obsessions and aversions.
Earl’s axiomatic foundations of psychological economics emphasize the importance 
of perception and context; the social nature of behaviour; the impacts of non-economic variables; and the importance of bounded rationality – specifically when information is too complex for human cognition. Earl’s foundations also include Herbert Simon’s concept of ‘satisficing’ (that is, finding a satisfactory solution even if it’s not the best solution); attention biases occurring when attention is not allocated optimally leading to 
 inc
onsistencies; and heuristics and biases shaping perceptions and judgments. The latter 
will include temporal biases, for example as seen in models of hyperbolic and quasi-  
hy
perbolic discounting; emotions; impacts of context on decision rules; limited learning 
constrained by people’s preconceptions about the world. In addition, he includes patho -
logical behaviours, for example impulsive spending; impacts on choices of personalities and attitudes , as well as simple preferences; and altruistic choices (Earl 2005).
Axiomatic foundations unify economics and psychology in psychological economics 
but Earl argues that economic psychology and psychological economics are different too: the former involves economists taking subjects traditionally in the psychologists’ preserve such as addiction and altruism, and analysing them using economic models and concepts. kEY  InSIgHtS FroM P SYCH o log Y  9
Psychological economics comes from the other direction and involves challenging stand -
ard economic models by embedding insights from psychology to enhance understand -
ing of economic decision-making, for example Frey’s (1997) broad study of motivation 
(Earl 2005).
key insights from psychology
In taking on the essential assumptions of neoclassical economics, behavioural economists populate their models with people who are far more susceptible to social and psychological influences than Homo economicus . On this point, it is important to note that behavioural eco -
nomics is not one coherent and self-contained subject – there is a spectrum of approaches to behavioural economics, reflecting the extent to which key insights from psychology, sociology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology are brought into the frame. Some be -
havioural economists develop models in which the neoclassical model is “tweaked” with some socio-psychological insights – such as that people are not always selfish. Other be -
havoural economists focus much more strongly on the role of personality, emotions and psychological biases in economic and financial decision-making. Whilst this book takes a broad view of which psychological insights are most relevant and interesting, nonethe -
less it is important to recognize that behavioural economics, economic psychology and psychological economics are not necessarily the same thing. There are many parallels be -
tween them but subtle differences too. Some behavioural economists are interested only in observable and measurable impacts on behaviour and preferences and are less interested in the underlying psychological processes. They would argue that these underlying varia -
bles are not easily measurable and so cannot form the basis of an objective science.
How do behavioural economists bring psychology into their models? This is a dif -
ficult question to answer quickly because psychology encompasses such a large range of ideas and sub-disciplines and such a large number of tools and techniques.
The incorporation of psychology into economics is controversial. For some econ -
omists, embedding a deeper understanding of what motivates choices and decisions is an anathema because, for example, in positivist, neoclassical approaches, the focus is on 
objectively measurable data such as observed choices. Earl (2005) observes that such crit-icisms may reflect the fact that psychology as a discipline lacks a grand unifying theory. There are many different psychological approaches but fragmentation within psychology not only discourages economists from making an investment in understanding psycho -
logical theories; it also encourages a piecemeal, ad hoc approach to embedding psycho -
logical insights into economics (Earl 2005). This selective use of psychological insights in behavioural economics may undermine its credibility for some.
Behavioural psychology has had a profound influence on modern behavioural eco -
nomics and helps to explain the distinction between it and economic psychology. In contrast to economic psychology, the areas of behavioural economics that are closest to mainstream economic theory adopt the methodology of behavioural psychology by focusing on observed choices and revealed preferences using experimental methods and 
abstracting from cognitive and emotional processes underlying decision-making. It could be argued that this  approach has in some ways been made obsolete by technology: as the 
sophistication and precision of neuroscientific tools and techniques has increased, the ob -
jective information available to a scientist is no longer confined to studying what people 10 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
actually do (or don’t do) because it is now possible objectively to measure the physiologi -
cal responses underlying observed action. However, as for psychology more generally, the 
early development of new neuroscientific tools has led to the evolution of neuroeconomic 
 an
alyses – observable data is no longer confined to what people do; we can also measure 
what is going on in their brains and nervous systems whilst they do it, as the neuroeco -
nomic studies explored in this book will show.
Behavioural tools and methods
Now that we have outlined some of the key insights that behavioural economists take from economics and psychology, we can see how they also combine different meth -
ods from economics and psychology – including economists’ traditional econometric and modelling tools, alongside methods from game theory – and also experimental ap -
proaches from psychology. All these sub-disciplines already have their own large and rich literatures and there is not the space to explore them in detail in this book alongside the enormous behavioural economics literature but a quick summary is given below, along -
side some reading recommendations in Further Reading.
game theory
Many areas of behavioural economics focus on strategic interactions between people and standard game theoretic tools are used as a starting point in these analyses. Putting game theory together with behavioural insights produces the large, diverse field known as be -
havioural game theory, surveyed comprehensively by Camerer (2003b) and partly cov -
ered here in the chapters on learning (Chapter 5) and sociality (Chapter 6 ). In explaining 
behavioural game theory, Camerer makes a distinction between games, which are strate -
gic situations, and game theory – which gives explanations for choices. In standard game theory, there is a divorce of theory and evidence and limited empirical evidence. Camerer (2003) cites von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944): “the empirical background of eco -
nomic science is definitely inadequate. Our knowledge of the relevant facts of economics is incomparably smaller than that commanded in physics at the time when mathematici -
sation of that subject was achieved”. Camerer suggests that this gap between theory and evidence seen in standard game theoretic approaches can be remedied to an extent by the inclusion of experimental techniques. This can be achieved by starting with classical game theory – including games that incorporate private information alongside probabil -
istic information about others’ preferences and/or types.
Behavioural game theory can be used to test the standard economists’ hypotheses by 
adapting classical game theory (in which people are assumed to be self-interested maximiz -
ers, engaging strategically) to allow for additional behavioural forces, for example limits to strategic thinking, and attitudes towards others’ payoffs and learning. If it leads to rejections 
of predictions of classical game theory, evidence from behavioural game theory can be in -
terpreted in a number of ways, particularly as much of it is based on experimental evidence: violations could reflect irrationality or weaker versions of rationality (e.g. as explored by Herbert Simon in his analyses of bounded and procedural rationality); “other-regarding” preferences (e.g. for reciprocity, equity, etc.); strategic thinking and/or reputation building.
For the purposes of this book, the reader is assumed to have a basic working knowl -
edge of game theory and its key concepts including Nash equilibrium, mixed strategy BEHaVIoUr al tool S an D M EtHoDS  11
equilibrium, reaction functions  and backward induction. For the learning chapter in par -
ticular, it will  be useful to know some classic games from standard introductory econom -
ics, for example the prisoner’s dilemma, battle of the sexes, buyer-seller and stag-hunt 
games. For those who would like to learn more about game theory to enhance their 
 un
derstanding of related areas of behavioural economics, some good introductions are 
listed in the Further Reading section.
Experimental economics
Empirical testing of behavioural economics models uses a range of data and some data is 
similar to data used in standard economic analysis. In terms of the methodological tools used by behavioural economists, there have been some innovations and data-based sta -
tistical and econometric analyses are increasingly being supplemented by experimental evidence. In fact, some areas of behavioural economics have emerged from experimental economics. Behavioural models can explain experimental results that, for one reason or another (and there is plenty of controversy about the reasons), do not fit with simple pre -
dictions from standard theory.
Vernon L. Smith pioneered the use of experiments in economics and initially used 
market experiments as a pedagogical device in his principles of economics lectures (Smith 2003a). Experimental methods can be integral to behavioural economics because they 
enable close observation of actual choices under carefully controlled conditions, thus allowing the experimenter to abstract from ordinary complicating factors. If properly constructed, experiments can allow us properly to control conditions so as to capture the real drivers of behaviour.
The main advantage of an experimental approach is it gives us new types of data to il -
luminate economic decision-making that will, in some circumstances, be better than the “happenstance” data of conventional economics/econometrics. Experimental methods are also used in neuroeconomic studies particularly when the tight analytical structure of game theoretic methods can be used to complement a wide range of neuroscientific techniques (to be explored in more detail in Chapters 11 and 12). This enables the con -
struction of neuroeconomic experiments that can be conducted quickly, efficiently and neatly to test neuroeconomic hypotheses clearly.
Experimental investigations can however be fraught with problems, as explored by 
Smith (1994), Binmore (1999) and others. Experimental designs must be “clean” with proper controls, clear and simple instructions and clear incentives. Results in experi -
mental context can be conflated with impacts from methodological variables (e.g. repeti -
tion, anonymity); demographic factors (gender, age, socioeconomic group, etc.); cultural factors; game structure and/or labelling and context. Designing a clean, uncomplicated experiment is not easy to achieve and needs a lot of careful thought.
One aspect of experimental design that attracts strong views from economists is the 
issue of deception. Is it a methodological problem? In principle, incorporating decep -
tion into experiments conflicts with the focus in experimental economics on truthful -
ness as an essential element in “clean” experiments. On the other hand, particularly in neuroeconomic experiments where the experimental environment necessarily is highly constrained, it is often impossible to avoid some limited deception. Sanfey et al. ’s (2003) 
fMRI study of social emotions (explored in Chapter 8) used a contrived offer algorithm in which the experimental subjects were told that they were responding to decisions from 12 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
real people when in fact they were responding to offers generated by the experimenters. 
Sanfey et al. argued that their deception was necessary, given the “heavy logistic demands” 
of fMRI studies and did not affect/confound the interpretation of results. The use of limited deception, and only where essential, is increasing in neuroeconomic studies, es -
pecially imaging studies, because the experimental context is so restricted by technical, logistical and financial considerations. Psychologists sometimes have a more flexible atti -
tude to deception and will incorporate carefully constrained deception when necessary. It is possible that the issue of deception in experiments is a question of experimental norms rather than objective limitations from deception.
In addition to the challenge of designing a clean experiment, it is also important to 
recognize the limitations of experimental evidence. These limitations are likely to be less for natural and field experiment s where researchers are observing real behavior in which 
real choices drive real-world consequences for the people being studied. DellaVigna and Malmendier’s (2004) study of gym membership, explored in Chapter 10 , is an example 
of a natural experiment. Aside from these types of natural/field experiments, results from experiments may suffer from hypothetical bias – experimental subjects may behave in a very different way when they know that they are not making a real-world decision. Results may have limited external validity and may not be generalizable to the world outside the lab. This may reflect the selection of experimental subjects, especially as ex -
perimental subjects are often university students whose behaviour may not represent the behaviour of people outside an academic environment, such as a university. Results from behavioural experiments have been generalized mainly by increasing the size of payoffs. Richer, more sophisticated, experiments do need to be designed if insights from behav -
ioural experiments are to be applied more widely. Some experiments do have inherent external validity , including natural experiments in which people’s ordinary behaviour is 
already controlled by the situation in which they find themselves. In natural experiments, the experimenter is not interfering and distorting decisions.
Field experiments are used frequently in behavioural development economics – often via 
the adoption of randomized controlled trials incorporating techniques developed for med -
ical/pharmaceutical testing. Randomised controlled trials are used to capture the impact of different “treatments” or policy interventions. They are constructed by randomly selecting some groups for an intervention. Other groups are used as control groups. Comparing the behaviour of treatment groups and control groups enables quantification of treatment effects. There are potential ethical problems with randomized controlled trials because some groups get access to potential beneficial interventions whilst others do not. This issue is addressed in medical trials by abandoning the random allocation of people into treatment groups versus control groups as soon as strongly significant impacts from interventions are identified.
Experimental economics is also limited by problems with experimental incentive 
structures. In real-world situations people face complex but often very salient incentives and it can be hard for an experimenter to identify meaningful incentive structures, par -
ticularly if subjects initially motivated by intellectual curiosity, for example, are then dis -
tracted and de-motivated by (perhaps insultingly) small experimental payments. 
 Gne
ezy 
and Rustichini (2000a, 2000b) have explored this problem in arguing that extrinsic mo -
tivations such as money and other concrete rewards crowd out intrinsic motivations , 
including intellectual curiosity and a desire to be helpful. De-motivated experimental subjects can distort experimental results. 13 tHE  StrUCtUrE oF Behavioural econ omics and Finance
The behavioural economics literature on its own is vast and so there is not the space 
for a detailed account of experimental economics too. There are however already a few 
comprehensive accounts of experimental economics and for those interested to find out more, some readings are suggested in Further Reading.
the structure of Behavioural eco nomics and Finance
Behavioural Economics and Finance provides a broad introduction to key debates and a range of behavioural principles will be explored. The literature is already enormous and is grow -
ing rapidly so it would be impossible to cover in one book all the interesting things that behavioural economists are doing. So, the following chapters focus on aspects of behav -
ioural economics and finance that are relatively well-established and/or have received a lot of attention. This book is sub-divided into three key sections. In the first section, we will explore a range of insights that offer behavioural alternatives to the microeco -
nomic principles usually embraced by economists – focusing on different behavioural approaches to motivations and incentives; heuristics and bias; behavioural theories of risk, including prospect theory and its alternatives; learning; and inconsistencies in the way that people deal with time ( “time inconsistency” ) and addictive behaviour. Cognitive 
neuroscience is bringing additional innovative insights and tools that are transforming behavioural economic analysis and so the Microeconomic Principles section will include  
two chapters dedicated to theoretical insights and empirical tools from 
 ne
uroeconomics  – 
an exciting new sub-discipline which combines economic theory with cutting-edge neu -
roscientific tools to unravel the economic, psychological and social influences on our economic decision-making.
The second section, focuses specifically on behavioural finance – starting with an 
outline of some key principles from behavioural finance and in particular a number of behavioural anomalies that Nobel Prize-winner Richard Thaler and others have identified specifically in the context of financial decision-making. This section will also explore how behavioural economic theory can be applied specifically in the context of corporate finance and investment. The other behavioural finance chapters will explore how personality and emotions drive financial trading and speculation, how these factors contribute to financial instability and – to complement the chapter s on neuroeconomics – how neuroscientific 
tools have been used specifically to test a range of assumptions about socio-psychological influences on financial decision-making, as explored in the sub-discipline of neurofinance.
The third and final section of the book will look at behavioural influences from 
broader perspectives and will include chapters on behavioural macroeconomics, happi -
ness and well-being, and behavioural public policy.
a note on mathematics
Mathematical exposition characterizes modern economics and this is not necessarily a bad thing if mathematical and intuitive explanations complement each other. Sometimes it is easier to explain things using simple equations than dense text, and many behavioural economists have set their models out using some (often quite straightforward) mathe -
matics. Other times it is more meaningful to express things in words than in 
 equ
ations  – 
especially as the human brain is not always well built to process mathematical analysis. 14 Intro DUCI ng B EHaVIoUr al E Cono MI CS
Given the wide range of attitudes towards mathematical analysis, in the interests of pre -
senting the material in a way which is engaging to as many readers as possible, the main 
text is written in non-mathematical language. Where it is relevant and to cater for those who prefer the simplicity of mathematical analysis, the essential principles and models are separated into chapter Appendices. The essential intuition of all models will be cov -
ered in the main text of each chapter and so readers can ignore the mathematical trans -
lations if they prefer.
Chapter summary
 •Behavioural economics is a wide discipline that draws on a range of other subjects from the social and natural sciences – including psychology, sociology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology.
 •Whilst it has only recently developed a critical mass within economic theory and pub -
lic policy-making, behavioural economics draws on long traditions in  ec
onomics  – 
from Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham through to John Maynard Keynes, George Katona and Hyman Minsky.
 •Behavioural economists rethink what economists usually assume about behaviour – not by assuming that behaviour is irrational, but by providing a more realistic analysis of how real people decide and choose, replacing the models associated with modern mainstream economics, which assume that people decide as if they are mathematical maximizers.
 •Behavioural economics draws on a wide range of insights from economics more 
 ge
nerally – including ideas about strategic decision-making from game theory, in -
sights from theories of learning and some themes from information economics and labour economics.

Microeconomic  principlesChapter 2
Motivations and incentives
In mainstream economics, what is often loosely described as neoclassical economics, 
 ec
onomic agents are assumed to be driven by purely economic and monetary motivations. 
A large section of behavioural economics takes on the assumptions associated with this 
mainstream model to explore other drivers of our everyday choices and decisions. In this chapter, we will explore some of these non-monetary motivations, and the models and em -
pirical techniques that behavioural economists use to capture them. In understanding what drives the wider range of incentives and motivations that behavioural economists explore, it is important to understand well some of the assumptions and microeconomic principles from neoclassical models because these models focus strongly on the idea that rational “agents” respond perfectly to incentives. We shall begin this chapter exploring the approach to analysing incentives that is conventionally adopted by non-behavioural economists.
Incentives in neoclassical economics
In explaining how incentives drive agents’ choices, neoclassical economists make assump -
tions to construct an artificial model of human decision-making. It is useful in under -
standing this artificial model to imagine that economies operate as if they are populated by a specific type of artificially conceived species: Homo economicus . Homo economicus is as -
sumed to have an exceptional capacity for information processing and decision-making. In this model, people are assumed to be:
a. Well-informed and able to use information efficiently.
b. Independent in two senses:
i. atomistic – they do not look to others when deciding what to do;
ii. selfish – their utility is determined only by their own comforts.
c. Rational maximizers:
i. using information efficiently by applying mathematical tools to guide their be -
haviour, so their behaviour is systematic and objectively determined, and im -
mune from emotional and sentimental forces, especially if these are associated with systematic biases in decision-making. As rational maximizers, generally Homo economicus is assumed to maximize utility and profits in monetary terms;20 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
ii. forward-looking in a systematic way, which involves discounting the future 
in ways which are consistent over time so that it makes no difference whether Homo economicus is looking one day ahead or one decade ahead: their choices about future plans are consistent.
d. Homogenous, i.e. all members of the Homo economicus species behave in the same way (on average at least) so that one model can capture everyone (on average at least).
These standard assumptions imply that, at the extreme, standard economic models de -
scribe people as robotic, mathematical machines, and so understanding and controlling behaviour can be seen as, in many ways, more similar to an engineering problem than a socio-psychological problem. Behavioural economics takes on this approach to develop a more realistic view of how real people make their economic decisions and choices, start -
ing by exploring the non-monetary incentives and motivations that drive our behaviour.
Extrinsic versus intrinsic motivations
In challenging the standard neoclassical approach to incentives, behavioural economists start by exploring the wider range of incentives and motivations that drive people’s choices and decisions – and a prominent theme in this behavioural literature comes in capturing interactions between individual and cooperative goals. Constructing markets around peo -
ple’s willingess to pay for things that have been traditionally been sustained on the basis of social values can threaten the existence of socially beneficial actions. Titmuss (1970) described the negative impact of introducing payments for blood donation: payments undermined social values and dampened people’s willingness to donate. Frey and Jegen (2001) examine this phenomenon in the context of motivation crowding theory and draw on insights from psychology about the “hidden costs of rewards”: monetary incentives drive extrinsic motivation (motivation driven by external rewards) and undermine in -
trinsic motivations, including internally-driven motivations such as curiosity, helpfulness and self-realization. Crowding-out of intrinsic effects undermines the focus in standard economic theory on the importance of monetary rewards and incentives.
Motivating environmental awareness
Many of these insights have been applied in the context of environment decision-making. In an ideal world, people should be motivated by their sense of social responsibility to care about the environment – for example, Gowdy (2008) applies insights from behavioural economics and experimental psychology to the issue of climate change and specifically to the question of reducing CO
2 emissions. He argues that resolving the current crisis of sus -
tainability needs more emphasis on broader facets of human behaviour, including trade-offs between greed and egoism versus cooperation and altruism. Rational choice theory does not capture these trade-offs effectively and so will not be a good guide, for example for policy-makers trying to encourage people to consider more carefully their energy and environment decisions. Financial incentives may in fact crowd out extrinsic motivations and feelings of collective responsibility unless  environmental policy draw s on cooperative, 
non-materialistic aspects of human nature. Frey (1997) argues that monetary incentives can crowd out civic motives but money can also “crowd in” civic motivations when it is used to acknowledge social worth of individual contributions (Frey and Oberholzer-Gee 1997).EXtrInSIC V ErSU S Intr InSI C MotI VatIonS  21
Concerns about fairness will also affect the global management of environmental 
decisions, especially with respect to the developing world. Dealing with climate change 
will need cooperation, trust and reciprocity and even when cooperative frameworks are imperfect, participation can establish credibility and goodwill (Gowdy 2008). Given that richer countries in what is known as the global North got rich by burning fossil fuels, is it fair to tell the developing world to stop using them? Stiglitz (2006) argues that a fair solution could be to implement a common global carbon tax and allow each country to keep the carbon tax revenues so that if less developed countries are polluting more then they will also have more taxation revenue to spend on either reducing the taxation burden in other areas, or increasing expenditure, including expenditures to support development of new, environmentally friendly technologies.
Bénabou and Tirole (2003) adapt these insights and incorporate them within an eco -
nomic analysis of principal–agent problems. External rewards offered by a principal (e.g. an employer ) affect the intrinsic motivations of an agent (e.g. an employee ) so that exter -
nal incentives are weakly reinforcing in the short-run and negatively reinforcing in the long-run. There are many examples from experimental economics. In one study, univer -
sity students were asked to solve a puzzle. Those who were not paid, and so were presum -
ably doing the puzzle for the intellectual challenge, put more effort into the task than the students who were paid (Deci 1975).
Gneezy and Rustichini also report results from a field study of parents collecting 
children from school. Parents would often arrive late forcing the school to make sure a teacher was available to look after the children until their parents arrived. The school decided to introduce a fine as a deterrent but the plan backfired and more parents arrived late with a late fine than without one (Gneezy and Rustichini 2000a). This phenomenon may reflect the fact that, once a fine was introduced, arriving late was then interpreted as costly service and any guilt that parents may formerly have felt about arriving late was reduced when they felt they were choosing to pay for the privilege of arriving late. The extrinsic disincentive (the fine) crowded-out the intrinsic motivation – to cooperate by trying to arrive on time as often as possible.
Gneezy and Rustichini (2000b) found similar results to these earlier studies in an 
analysis of the performance of experimental subjects (students from the University of Haifa, Israel) completing a series of quizzes and offered a range of different incentives –  
with payments made as New Israeli Shekels (NISs). One group was given no payment; the second, third and fourth groups were paid 10 cents, 1 NIS and 3 NIS respectively and performance was lowest in the second group. Those who were not paid at all performed better than those with a small 10 cents payment. Gneezy and Rustichini found similar results for a study of volunteer work by high school children and conclude that excessively small payments can be demotivating leading to worse performance than no payment at all because small payments crowd out intrinsic motivation without offering sufficient exter -
nal incentives to leverage extrinsic motivations.
Bénabou and Tirole (2006) use concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to ex -
plain pro-social behaviour. In many contexts, people exhibit pro-social behaviour in -
volving altruism or reciprocity. This reflects not only intrinsic motivations but also social pressures and social norms which link into reputations and self-respect. Taking into ac -
count this mix of motivations, as well as heterogeneity in propensities towards altruism and self-interest, Bénabou and Tirole construct a model in which choices are the outcome of three motivators: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and reputation building. 22 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
Extrinsic rewards not only crowd-out intrinsic motivations but they also “spoil” the rep -
utational and/or self-image value of pro-social choices.
Ariely et al. (2009a) explore intrinsic motivation, specifically personal preferences for 
giving, extrinsic motivation and image motivation. They formulate an “effectiveness hypoth -
esis”: extrinsic rewards are less effective for visible pro-social actions: extrinsic rewards deter 
pro-social behaviour because they dilute its signalling value. They explore these hypotheses using experimental evidence from subjects randomly assigned to one of two US charities, either the American Red Cross or the National Rifle Association. Charities were labelled as “good” or “bad” according to participants’ perceptions of the majority’s view. 
 P
articipants  
were asked to engage in a simple but effortful task (pressing X and Z on a keyboard). Perfor -
mance was rewarded with donations by the experimenters to the subject’s nominated char -
ity. There were significant differences in effort under “public” conditions (when subjects’ 
efforts were revealed) versus private conditions (when efforts weren’t revealed). When no  
monetary incentives were offered, subjects in the public condition  made more effort . Mone -
tary incentives did not increase effort in public condition; in the private condition there were significant increases in effort with monetary incentives . Ariely et al.  interpret this as support 
for their effectiveness hypothesis: monetary incentives work better for anonymous giving  
but they have a negative impact on public giving perhaps because the social signalling value of philanthropy is diluted when efforts and payments are public knowledge.
Social motivations
As we explored in the introduction, behavioural economists learn a number of lessons from other social sciences – including insights from psychology and sociology  around the idea 
that, as social creatures, we are not purely self-interested. Our incentives and motivations are also determined by our relationships with other people around us. Nobel Prize-
 wi
nning 
economist Amartya Sen (1977, 1991) argues that the focus on a single assumption of self-  
in
terest in standard models suggests that people are “rational fools”, considering only a 
single preference ordering given by self-interest without recognizing social  preferences over 
a range of alternatives. Conversely, in his comparative analysis of Adam Smith’s (1776) An In -
quiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations and his (1759) Theory of Moral Sentiments , Vernon 
L. Smith (1998) hypothesizes that altruism and self-interest, whilst apparently contradictory, are actually consistent – an idea we introduced in Chapter 1. The self-interest in the Wealth of Nations  and the sympathy in the Theory of Moral Sentiments  are different facets of the same thing – 
a “self-interested propensity to exchange”. In the Wealth of Nations it is exchange of money and goods; in the Theory of Moral Sentiments  it is exchange of friendship. In this way, Vernon L. 
Smith asserts that self-interest and other-regarding sympathy are connected.
Behavioural game theory
Behavioural economists address these debates about the limits to our self-interest by build -
ing models incorporating social preferences, sometimes called other-regarding prefer -
ences. The main theoretical vehicle for analysing the links between our social preferences and social motivations is behavioural game theory – in which social preferences are intro -
duced into standard games explored by economists – providing a starting point for many of the experimental tests of people’s social preferences. Some versions of behavioural game SoCIal Mo tIVatIonS  23
theory were developed in response to robust experimental studies of a wide range of games 
showing that people do not always play games selfishly and so behaviour does not converge in the ways predicted by standard game theory – see Camerer (2003a,b) for surveys. Some of the games commonly used in these experimental analyses, and the standard game the -
ory solutions consistent with perfectly rational choice, are summarized in Box 2.1.
Box 2.1 Box of games
Ultimatum game
Player A (the proposer) is given a sum to divide between herself and player B (the responder). If 
B rejects A’s offer, both players get zero. IF B accepts A’s offer, players get the share proposed by A. Standard game theory predicts that A will offer the minimum possible amount and B will accept it because a rational maximiser will prefer anything, no matter how small, to nothing.
Dictator game
Player A, the dictator, is given a sum of money and offers a share to player B; player B cannot veto the offer and must take what he’s given by A. Standard game theory predicts that Player A will maximize by offering B the minimum possible amount.
Envy games
These games are variants of dictator or ultimatum games but are designed to disentangle preferences about relative advantage. Player A has a choice between dividing a small amount equally between themselves and Player B versus a larger amount but with proportionately more offered to Player B. For example, Player A is told to choose between:
1.
 £1
0 divided equally so that A keeps £5 and gives £5 to Player B; and
2. £1
5 divided unequally with Player A keeping a lesser share of £6 and giving £9 to 
Player B.
Standard game theory predicts that A will prefer option 2 because they will prefer more to less and will ignore how it is distributed.
Public goods games
In these games, each player makes a contribution to a public good. Their benefit may exceed their contribution but because, by definition, access to public goods is free and non-rivalrous: in other words, public goods are freely available and accessible for everyone to use, and one person using the public good does not prevent another person from using it. Under these conditions, there is no economic incentive for a perfectly rational, maximising individual to contribute money to something they can access for free. So standard game theory predicts scenarios in which players free-ride on others’ contributions.
trust games
Trust games are two stage games:
In stage 1, Player A – the trustor – offers a sum of money for Player B – the trustee. A’s 
contribution is multiplied by some factor by the experimenter and then given to Player  B.
In stage 2, B decides how much to return to A.24 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
If A is generous/trusting and B reciprocates then there is a Pareto improvement be -
cause both players will be better off. However, standard game theory predicts ‘back -
ward induction’, that is, each player reasons back from the very last stage of a game to 
figure out which strategies to use in the earlier stages of the game. Person A figures that B will not send anything back because he has no monetary incentive to do so and so A doesn’t send anything in the first place. (Sometimes known as investment games or gift exchange games.)
Centipede games
Centipede games are multistage versions of trust games; sums of money are sent back and forth between A (the trustor) and B (the trustee) until one or other player “takes” by deciding how much to keep for themselves . At that point, the game ends. In the meantime, if the player 
decides to continue playing then they “pass” at each stage. Standard game theory predicts backward induction as for the trust game but in real-life experiments people backward in -
duct only a couple of steps (Camerer 2003b).
Solidarity games
In a solidarity game, three players roll a die to determine a win. Before rolling the die, each player announces how they will allocate “gifts” to the losers.
This game can be used to separate some of the explanations for generosity in simpler 
games such as the ultimatum game; e.g. some studies find that the same total amount is given regardless of the size of the group and therefore apparent generosity is not about inequity aversion; gifts for each loser are positively correlated with expectations of gifts from them (Bolton and Ockenfels 2000).
Ultimatum games and dictator games
In playing experimental games, Box 2.1 summarises some of the solutions that a per -
fectly rational maximising player would implement. A major contribution from behav -
ioural economics comes in showing that real people do not play these games in this sort 
of strictly rational way. The ultimatum game is possibly the most famous behavioural game and it has been extensively explored, not only by economists but also experi -
mental psychologists, neuroscientists and even behavioural ecologists. In the ultimatum game, the experimenter gives Alice (the proposer) a fixed sum – say £100; Alice is in -
structed to offer Bob (the responder) some proportion of that sum – a minimum of £1 to a maximum of £100. If Bob agrees, then they both get the shares proposed by Alice, but if Bob refuses, both get nothing. Standard game theory assumes “ monotonicity ”, 
that is, that more will be preferred to less and so Alice will want to keep as much for herself as possible. She will offer Bob £1 and keep £99 for herself. Bob will prefer £1 to nothing and so will accept Alice’s offer. Thus, standard game theory predicts offers and acceptances close to zero.
Experimental evidence shows , however , that people do not play in this way in the 
real world: Güth, Schmittberger and Schwarze (1982) conducted the first comprehensive testing of the original ultimatum game and found that players were often guided by what they thought was a fair or just outcome. Assuming that 50% was perceived as a “fair” SoCIal Mo tIVatIonS  25
offer, proposers usually offered responders a lot more than zero and relatively close to 
50%; and proposers rejected offers around 20%. These findings were replicated across many studies (including animal studies, for example with monkeys playing for juice). In a meta-analysis of results from the ultimatum game, Camerer found that the mean offer was around 30–40% and offers below about 20% were rejected. The findings were also scalable, with similar results for small versus large sums of money, though there were some cultural differences (Camerer 2003b; Henrich et al.  2004). Andersen et al.  (2011) a n -
alysed strategies played by people in poor villages of Northeast India for whom increases in monetary stakes had a far larger impact. Andersen et al.  found that, even when the stakes 
are relatively large, responders will still reject low offers and end-up with zero – inter -
preted by some researchers as reflecting the responders’ desires to punish the proposer for making an insultingly low offer.
Experiments with trust games
Berg, Dickhaut and McCabe (1995) explore trust, reciprocity and social history and try to answer questions about why we trust and whether or not trust is a primitive response. They construct a repeated game but one which abstracts from reputation and contractual pre-commitments by using a trust game designed to test trust and trustworthiness. This game tests the extent to which people trust others and in turn reciprocate trust by being trustworthy themselves. Trusting and being trustworthy represent two challenges to nar -
row self-interest: trusting is a risky strategy and may not be reciprocated; trustworthiness yields no direct, immediate return.
Berg et al. note that a problem with trust games (and similar games including the 
ultimatum and dictator games) is that experimental subjects may want to impress experimenters with their generosity, so they incorporate some experimental design features to reduce the likelihood of experimental bias, introducing a double-blind procedure in which the subjects make contributions anonymously using envelopes and boxes. The experimenter cannot know (and the subjects know that the experi -
menter cannot know) who has been generous and so there are neither sanctions nor rewards for altruistic choices. In this way, Berg et al.  hope that their experimental 
design will allow them to abstract from relationships, social influences, communica -
tion, and so on.
Berg et al. use two groups of subjects in two rooms: subject As in Room A and subject 
Bs in Room B. All subjects are given $10 to either keep or share. The game then proceeds in two stages. In Stage 1, subject A decides how much of her $10 to send to an anonymous counterpart in room B (the trustee). Stage 1 tests the trust of players A; if they do not trust the people in Room B then they will send no money. In Stage 2, A’s contribution is tripled and given to player B. Player B must then decide by how much to reciprocate. Essentially, stage 2 is a dictator game; Player B has complete control over the outcome and Player A cannot veto his or her choice.
Standard game theory predicts that, if B is purely self-interested, then he has no in -
centive to reciprocate by being trustworthy and returning something to A. Via backward induction, player A reasons therefore that their best strategy is to send nothing because anything that they do send will be kept by B. Assuming that A is purely self-interested, then she has no incentive to send anything to B in the first place.26 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
The problem for both players is that they get stuck in something like a prisoner’s 
dilemma: both players could have done better by being generous. With no trust and no 
reciprocity A keeps $10, B does nothing and both suffer as a result because neither of them gets any more than their initial payment. On the other hand, if A had been maximally generous and offered $10 then this would have been tripled to $30. If B had sent half back to A, that is, $15, then this would have been a better outcome. Both players would have been unequivocally better off if they had been trusting and reciprocating. This links into evolutionary analyses in which making and returning kindnesses have evolutionary advantages in social environments.
Contributing nothing and not reciprocating is the standard game theory prediction 
but the experimental results from the trust games above resemble those seen in ultima -
tum games. In Berg et al. ’s study almost all Room A subjects were trusting; 30 out of 32 
subjects (94%) sent something to Room B, though there was a large degree of variability in amounts sent. There is less evidence of reciprocity from the players in room B though 57% did reciprocate by sending back more than A sent and, on average, players in room A did at least get their money back. Apart from that, the extent of trust and reciprocity was not correlated. To assess the impact of social norms, Berg et al . also analysed the impact 
of social history, that is, information about average responses in previous rounds. They found that these social norms did have some impact especially for players in room B.
The selection of experimental evidence outlined above suggests that people do not 
generally make choices consistent with the standard assumptions of game theory. There are a number of potential explanations: it could just be that people are inherently gen -
erous. Social norms may dictate that people play in a generous way. As explained in the context of learning models in the previous chapter, it may take time to learn the best strategies; if people have learnt social norms of generosity outside the lab then it takes time and experience to unlearn them. Responses may reflect strategic reasoning, for ex -
ample if people believe that stinginess will at some point be punished by the other player. Overall, there is an empirical problem in separating these hypotheses about motivation and a number of theoretical models have been devised to explain the results, as explored in the following section.
In attempting to reconcile the experimental results and varying interpretations, be -
havioural economists have come up with a range of theoretical explanations for the range of social preferences and motivations revealed in the experiments outlined above. These models focus on the different reasons for cooperation and altruism including traits of kindness and fairness, warm glow giving, inequity aversion, preferences for relative as well as absolute payoffs and strategic thinking. A selection of the models is outlined below.
Punishment and cooperation
Negative incentives can be motivating too. For example, punishment is a powerful negative incentive, and behavioural economists have explored punishment as a way to explain some of the experimental findings from behavioural game theory, as out -
lined above. These models present theoretical explanations for other-regarding behav -
iour but what sort of incentives and motivations encourage people to cooperate and/or to punish people who don’t? How are these motivations reinforced in a social context? Cooperation and punishment play a crucial role in explaining  why people sometimes SoCIal Mo tIVatIonS  27
cooperate  and other  times  do not. It is helpful to think about what deters people from 
violating social norms of reciprocity and what people can do to encourage others to 
cooperate.
altruistic punishment
Studies in behavioural economics and neuroeconomics have shown that people are willing to pay to punish norm violators. They also find that people who are initially cooperative, will start to defect if they are not punished. Fehr and Gächter (2000) study altruistic punishment of social norm violations. They begin by defining social norms as behavioural regularities based on socially shared belief about how to behave. Social norms are enforced via informal social sanctions and these sanctions determine work effort, consumption choices, common pool resources, as well as provision of public goods. Social history is important and people do punish inappropriate behaviour even when costly to themselves. Fehr and Gächter (2000) ex -
plore these insights in an experimental study of altruistic punishment based on an adaptation of Fehr and Schmidt’s (1999) version of  a public goods game, which we will explore in more 
depth below . Their experimental game was conducted in two stages: a contribution stage and 
a punishment stage. In the punishment stage, the players were given the opportunity to use monetized punishment points to punish defectors who had been mean in the contribution stage of the game . They find that, without punishment, there was  almost complete defection 
from social norms but with punishment a large r proportion cooperate d.
There are further differences dependent on the level of anonymity in the interactions. 
They divided the treatments into Partner and Stranger treatments. When subjects were playing with strangers they were less likely to cooperate; when they were playing with known partners and violations were punished, 82.5% of subjects cooperated fully. At the other extreme, in the no-punishment Stranger treatments, contributions converged onto full free-riding over time. A similar experimental design has been adapted for neuroeco -
nomic analysis by de Quervain et al.  (2004) who find that altruistic punishment stimulates 
neural responses usually associated with reward processing, as we will explore in more detail in the neuroeconomics chapters.
ostracism in social networks
Punishment can be particularly effective in social networks. Fowler and Christakis (2010) 
and Randa et al.  (2011) examined punishment within social networks. They conducted 
online experiments using Mechanical Turk (MTURK) to investigate large-scale cooper -
ation in social networks. The experimental subjects played public goods games either with or without punishment and were assigned partners either randomly or via their own choices . When partners are randomly allocated, cooperation is equally beneficial 
to all partners . There  is no incentive to cooperat e and so cooperation  decays over time, 
confirming Fehr and Gächter’s (2000) study. Also, social factors may operate  as much as 
a carrot as a stick: people are inclined to cooperate because they benefit in terms of their own social connectedness. Questions of depersonalization and identification (as explored in more detail in the identity section below) may also be relevant: if people feel that they have built a positive cooperative relationship with someone they know and/or identify with then that will encourage them to partner with that person again.28 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
Fowler and Christakis (2010) found that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain 
cooperation. Subjects were influenced by the contributions of others, including those 
with whom they did not interact initially. These social influences persist over time and spread through social networks. Randa et al.  (2011) developed this study to show experi -
mentally that people make and break social networks in response to cooperation versus defection by others. Cooperation decays over time if social links are outside the control of individuals (because they are fixed or determined randomly) or if links are updated infre -
quently. However, if subjects have short-term control of their social connections they can decide to break links with defectors and form links with cooperators. When people can choose who they do (and don’t) interact with, it creates an incentive to cooperate because defectors will be excluded from social networks if they behave uncooperatively.
Social motivation theory
In explaining some of the findings about social motivations, some behavioural economists have developed a range of theoretical models to capture social preferences and 
 mot
ivations  – 
via social motivation theory . In social motivation theories, theories of utility are developed essen -
tially to extend neoclassical conceptions of utility. These general utility models are designed to reconcile, albeit in a limited way in terms of links with other social sciences, the range of experimental evidence – from the market games evidence in which people exhibit pure self-interest through to the games which reveal generous behaviour in other contexts, for example the ultimatum, dictator and trust games explored above.
Bolton and ock enfels’ Equity, rec iprocity  
and Competition (E rC)
 model
Bolton and Ockenfels’ (1998, 2000) equity, reciprocity and competition (ERC) model is a general model of motivation, devised to capture other-regarding preferences. They argue that models with altruistic preferences cannot fully explain play in ultimatum games, dictator games and solidarity games because needs of others and reducing inequality are not necessarily primary goals.
Bolton and Ockenfels suggest that a good model should explain a number of statements 
summarising some  empirical regularities they identified from previous experimental analyses:
Statement 1:  In dictator games, on average dictators keep at least half but give less 
than the whole pie.Statement 2:  In ultimatum games, responders accept all offers of the whole pie and 
reject all offers of nothingStatement 3:  In ultimatum games, proposers will propose a payoff to themselves of 
at least half but less than the whole pie, i.e. offering some proportion less than half to the recipient.Statement 4:  Average offers in ultimatum games exceed average offers in dictator 
games.
Developing a comparative model from Bolton (1991) and Bolton and Ockenfels (1998), the ERC model assumes narrow self-interest but with people balancing trade-offs between their absolute pecuniary payoffs and relative payoffs. Relative payoffs are judged against SoCIal Mo tIVatIonS  29
a social reference point, assumed to be an equal share to each player, that is a share of ½ 
for a game with two players. The model is designed to capture play in one-shot games and it allows for incomplete information. Given imperfect information, “observables” are used to construct two thresholds at which behaviour deviates from monotonicity – the proposer’s offer threshold in the dictator game and the responder’s rejection threshold in the ultimatum game.
From this, Bolton and Ockenfels construct a general motivation function which incorporates 
monetary payoffs and relative shares. They illustrate their hypotheses using an example motivation function for a two-player game, incorporating a social reference point of equal shares. This function is also constructed so that larger deviations from equal share have proportionately larger impact in lowering utility. Each player’s type is given by the ratio of weights they assign to pecuniary versus relative payoffs, with the weights determined by individual differences , for example in age, education, politics  and religion. Narrow 
self-interest increases as the weight on pecuniary payoffs increases. The mathematics of their model is explored in the Mathematical Appendix A2.1.
Bolton and Ockenfels argue that their model is consistent with experimental evidence 
from a range of experimental contexts – including dictator and ultimatum games when generosity is observed, and auction games which reveal competitive play as predicted by standard game theory models. They argue that their model can reconcile apparently anomalous findings. This develops findings by Roth et al.  (1991) who identified differences 
in outcomes from market games versus bargaining games including the ultimatum game. Roth et al. describe evidence from experiments in Israel, Japan, the US and Yugoslavia. 
Market games converged onto the equilibria predicted by standard models but there was a wide variety of standard and non-standard outcomes for ultimatum games, suggesting that cultural differences may play a role in the formation of other-regarding preferences.
Bolton and Ockenfels’ emphasis on narrow self-interest means that their model fits 
more neatly with mainstream assumptions of rationality but they assert that their motiva -
tion function can also connect different social preferences seen in different contexts, for example sometimes people exhibit social preferences for fairness; other times they want to reciprocate and other times they want to compete. So the ERC model can reconcile evidence about equity, reciprocity and generosity with evidence about competitive self-
 
in
terested behaviour, allowing heterogeneous preferences to reflect differing motivations. 
The ERC model is also consistent with interplays of equity and strategy. For example, gen -
erous offers in ultimatum games may not reflect pure altruism and inequity aversion but may also reflect proposers strategically anticipating how responders might react.
Inequity aversion in Fehr and Schmidt’s Fairness, Competition  
and Co-operation (FCC) model
Fehr and Schmidt’s model develops Loewenstein, Thompson and Bazerman’s (1989) anal -
ysis of aversion to unequal outcomes within an experimental context. They analyse sub -
jects’ responses to hypothetical dispute scenarios in which the experimental subject is 
either acknowledged or snubbed by a hypothetical partner in a range of scenarios includ -
ing non-business interactions with a peer and business interactions between a customer and sales person. Subjects were asked to grade their satisfaction with the hypothetical solution. Loewenstein et al. used the fit of reported satisfactions to a range of social util -
ity functions and found that a utility function which incorporated discrepancies in the 30 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
payoffs between the members of each pair, that is, a function incorporating payoffs in 
which the experimental participant the subject got a better outcome than their partner, and payoffs in which the participant’s outcome was worse than their partner’s, correlated well with reported satisfaction.
Fehr and Schmidt develop Loewenstein et al. ’s (1989) model to construct their own 
model of Fairness, Competition and Co-operation (FCC) capturing the impacts on utility of what they describe as inequity aversion , that is, dislike of unequal outcomes. In this model, 
utility is affected by payoff differentials between players. If a person has a smaller payoff than other players then this will lower their utility; and if they have a larger payoff then that will raise their utility, as described mathematically in Mathematical Appendix 8.2.
Fehr and Schmidt describe two forms of inequity aversion: advantageous inequity 
aversion – inequity aversion experienced by people in a position of relative advantage; and disadvantageous inequity aversion – inequity aversion experienced by people in a position of relative disadvantage. For example, a banker who is unhappy about poverty is expe -
riencing advantageous inequity aversion; a poor person who is unhappy about bankers being rich is experiencing disadvantageous inequity aversion.
Overall, Fehr and Schmidt’s (1999) insights are somewhat similar to Bolton and Ock -
enfels (1998, 2000) though Fehr and Schmidt are less reliant on an assumption of narrow self-interest and assert that seemingly irrational behaviour in ultimatum games and dicta -
tor games reflects inequity aversion. Like Bolton and Ockenfels, Fehr and Schmidt claim that their FCC model can reconcile a range of experimental results showing that people are sometimes cooperative and sometimes selfish – in contrast to standard approaches predicting self-interested and uncooperative behaviour in all contexts. The FCC model can capture the range of responses including the fairness and cooperation seen in ultimatum games, public good games with punishments and gift exchange games (introduced on p. 24) . It can also explain the uncooperative competitive behaviour observed in market 
games and public good games without punishment.
Fehr and Schmidt’s assertion about the generality of their model has created some 
controversy. Binmore and Shaked (2010a, 2010b) assert that the empirical support for the inequity aversion model is not as robust as Fehr and Schmidt claim. Fehr and Schmidt (2010) respond that Binmore and Shaked have not posed a fundamental challenge to their approach. The dispute remains unresolved. More nuanced empirical testing of the various theories of inequity aversion will be helpful in resolving the debate.
Extending behavioural motivation models
The models presented above are an introduction to other-regarding preferences but many behavioural economists argue that they don’t go far enough in properly embedding the range of non-economic incentives and motivations driving behaviour. The social mo -
tivation models outlined above incorporate social elements as not much more than an “add-on” to neoclassical utility theory. Other behavioural economic models designed to capture social motivations build more links with other social and behavioural sciences, especially with psychology and sociology. Some of these insights link to elements similar to the Fehr and Schmidt model but with stronger psychological foundations. These in -
clude models of fairness, kindness and reciprocity, for example Rabin (1993), Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1986), and Falk and Fischbacher (2006). Fehr and Gintis (2007) assert that formal models of inequity aversion (Fehr and Schmidt 1999) and reciprocal fairness CHoICE oVErl oaD  31
(Falk and Fischbacher 2006) are indispensible tools in analyzing social phenomena but 
there is a large number of other theoretical explanations for generous behaviour.
Other models have focused on the emotional satisfaction derived from giving, for 
example Andreoni’s (1990) model of warm glow giving capturing the fact that utility increases with the act of giving, for example in donations to public goods. Theories of al -
truism and warm glow giving have been applied to ordinary daily activities including the trade-offs between volunteering and work. For example, Sauer (2011) analyses volunteer -
ing and finds that it is optimal when warm glow and expected future economic returns sufficiently outweigh disutility of extra work effort and childcare costs. Highly-educated women receive more ‘warm glow’ than men, and there are substantial economic and non-economic returns to volunteering, with returns to effort particularly high for those in part-time work.
Another set of theories revolves around the insight that generosity and altruism may 
represent investments in our interpersonal relationships and connections, as seen in social capital and social network theories – enormous literatures in themselves and beyond the scope of this book. For those interested to learn more, see Dasgupta (2007), Goyal (2009) on social networks and Halpern (2005), Putnam (2001) on social capital.
CHoICE oVErl oaD
Neoclassical utility theory assumes that people’s choices are constrained just by monetary constraints – specifically prices, income and wealth. Behavioural economics also captures a range of non-monetary, psychological/cognitive constraints which interact with some of the behavioural incentives and motivations explored in this chapter. Some of the main cognitive constraints include choice overload and information overload. The standard model in economics focuses on the importance of choice and implicitly it is assumed that the more choices we have the better we will be. Psychological research has shown , how -
ever, that too much choice – choice overload – can be demotivating. Iyengar and Lepper 
(2000) describe findings from three experimental studies illustrating the negative impacts from having too much choice. For all studies, participants were more satisfied with their selections and performed better when their set of options was limited. The first study ex -
amined the behaviour of shoppers at an upmarket grocery store. A tasting booth displayed either a limited choice of six jam flavours or an extensive choice of 24 jam flavours. Mo -
tivation was explored in two ways: the number of shoppers drawn to the booth and the number of jams they bought. For 242 subjects exposed to the extensive choice treatment, 145 stopped at the booth but only four bought jam. On the other hand, for 260 subjects exposed to the limited choice treatment, 104 stopped but 30 of those bought some jam. The study revealed that there was no correlation between the two forms of motivation: 40% of shoppers stopped at the booth displaying a limited range and 30% of them subse -
quently bought some jam. For the group encountering a booth with an extensive selection of jams: 60% of customers stopped but only 3% of them bought jam. For the second study, students were offered six or 30 potential essay topics for optional credit. Motivation was assessed in terms of number and quality of essays written. In the limited choice condition, 74% wrote an essay and the mean grade for these essays was 8.09. In the extended choice condition 60% wrote essays, with a mean grade of 7.69. For the third study, Iyengar and Lepper studied the choices of university students choosing chocolates and extended their experimental design by introducing three treatment conditions: no choice, limited choice 32 Mot IVatIonS an D InCEntI VES
(from six types of chocolate) and extensive choice (from 30 types of chocolate). The sub -
jects in the extensive choice group reported feeling that they had been offered too much 
choice and those who had a limited set of choices experienced more satisfaction. All these studies suggest that too much choice can be demotivating.
In capturing some the links with attention, Reutskaja et al . (2011) use eye-tracking 
techniques to detect how visual attention shifts when people are engaged in these choice tasks. The pattern of eye movements can serve as a proxy for how motivated people are by different stimuli. They apply this to studies similar to Iyengar and Lepper’s (2000) choice overload experiments. Eye tracking monitors the direction of a person’s gaze and uses this information to make inferences about which objects are attracting a person’s attention. Reutskaja et al. assessed the choices of hungry consumers choosing snack items but making 
their decisions within a strictly limited timeframe. They found that the experimental sub -
jects assessed objects according to their appeal and this assessment correlated strongly with willingness to pay. However, the eye-tracking evidence revealed that people had a tendency to look and choose according to the spatial placements on items within shop  displays.
The extent to which people perceive themselves to be overloaded with choices will 
also depend on the timeframe within which they must make their decisions. Gabaix and Laibson (2000) construct a model of decision-making that blends together insights about bounded rationality, satisficing and heuristics. If people have plenty of time to decide then they can reach the correct answer but real-life situations often involve time constraints. Gabaix and Laibson test their hypotheses using experiments on 259 Harvard undergradu -
ates and find that their subjects decided by identifying representative scenarios. In contrast to the backward induction hypothesized in standard game theory models, their evidence shows that people economize by simplifying decisions using heuristics quickly to identify 
feasible  paths.

We have seen in this chapter that behavioural economists extend the range of incentives and motivations that drive behaviour, including a range of intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivations and incentives. In exploring this literature, it is important to remember that behavioural economists do not argue against the idea that money is often a powerful incen -
tive. They are showing that we are driven by other  motivations too – and sometimes these 
other motivations interact with extrinsic motivations – such as money – in complicated ways, as captured in motivation crowding and social motivation theories. These complex influences on decision-making may also be distorted by the cognitive tools that people use to help them decide quickly – as we shall see in the next chapter, on Heuristics and Bias.
Chapter summary
 •Behavioural economists move beyond conventional economics in exploring a wider range of incentives and motivations, beyond financial and monetary motivations.
 •Financial and monetary motivations are captured in the category of extrinsic motiva -
tions. Intrinsic motivations are internally generated and are associated with internal rewards – such as pride in a job done well, satisfaction in performing tasks and desire to do good.a2.1 Mat HE MatIC S oF tHE B olton an D o CkEnFElS’ ErC MoDEl  33
 •Motivation crowding theory is about how extrinsic motivations crowd out intrinsic 
motivations so that when people are paid money they are sometimes less likely to draw on their intrinsic motivations – for example wanting to be fair to others.
 •Social motivation theory explores how social incentives are a key extrinsic motivation and are driven by people’s perception of social norms and social reference points.
 •Social motivation theory links to models of social preference, which build on key ideas from game theory, but with a behavioural–psychological dimension included.
 •Motivations and incentives can be dampened by choice and information overload, and some behavioural experiments have shown that when participants are given too many choices, participants’ performance will deteriorate.

The quadratic form allows that larger deviations from equal share have proportion -

Heuristics and bias
A common misperception about behavioural economics is that it is all about “irrational” 
decision-making when, in truth, behavioural economists challenge standard economic conceptions about rationality in much subtler ways. Most behavioural economists do not often argue that people are completely irrational – why would we have evolved to behave irrationally? Instead, behavioural economists focus on the limits to extreme assumptions about rationality associated with rational choice theory and/or they develop alternative conceptions of rationality. This allows us to understand why people make and repeat mis -
takes. This broader understanding of behaviour raises questions about the existence and nature of rationality: are people rational? For some behavioural economists (not all) the answer is “not always” – rather than an unequivocal “no”. Whether or not we are able to act in a rational way depends on the context in which we find ourselves.
This chapter explores some approaches to softening economists’ assumptions about 
rationality, focusing in particular on Herbert Simon’s insights about bounded rationality under conditions when rationality may not be about mathematical maximization and statistical reasoning, but will nonetheless involve systematic reasoning processes. In the context of bounded rationality, this chapter focuses on a range of biases and heuristics that affect decision-making under uncertainty. In understanding the influence of biases and heuristics it is useful to outline some different conceptions of rationality as seen in economic analyses. Then some key elements of Kahneman, Tversky, Thaler and others’ models of quasi-rational decision-making – including biases, heuristics, cognitive disso -
nance and cognitive balance – will be explored.
Defining rationality
In economics, standard decision-making models focus on behaviour as the outcome of a mathematical process. This assumes “hyper-rationality” – that people are using a high level of rationality to guide their choices. Strict axioms of rationality as outlined by von 
Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) and Savage (1954) and in this section we will focus on analyses of rationality that have emerged since the widespread adoption of rationality axioms in economic theory.36 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
Procedural versus substantive rationality
Herbert Simon (1955, 1972, 1979) replaces the global rationality of economic man with a 
model of bounded rationality. An uncertain future, bounds to rationality, including cog -
nitive and information processing constraints as well as imperfect information, will mean that people, at best, are able to act in a broadly reasonable rather than strictly rational way. They will be satisficers rather than maximizers (Simon 1979). Simon also analyses rational behaviour as “behavior appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints” (Simon 1972, p.161). It follows that a wide range of definitions of rationality can be constructed, depending on how broadly the given conditions and constraints are defined. Simon’s concept of bounded rationality focuses on decision-making when there are constraints on information and cognitive capacity. Whilst much analysis of bounded rationality has focused on data inputs, ration -
ality may also be bounded because humans are not always good at processing numerical and probabilistic information. Simon (1972) notes that rationality will also be bounded when situations are particularly complex, when it is not easy to identify the best course of action.
Simon analyses the strong assumptions about information and information process -
ing associated with the standard economic model in which rational agents use tools of differential calculus to maximize their utility or profits. Simon describes this as substan -
tive rationality, rationality based on an underlying mathematical process reflecting the application of a mathematical algorithm. Subjective probabilities can be consistent with substantive rationality assuming Bayesian rationality, that is, the application of Bayes’s rule – described in Chapter 5 in the context of social learning. This is still substantive rationality because it is grounded on an algorithmic approach: a mathematical/statistical rule is known and applied.
Procedural rationality is a broader concept, is not dependent on the use of mathe -
matical algorithms and reflects a response to constraints on computational capacity and the emphasis on problem-solving rather than optimizing. That means that it is harder precisely to define. Intuition guides behaviour and judgements are the outcome of “appro -
priate deliberation” rather than algorithmic, substantive decision-making (Simon 1955; Baddeley 2006a; Baddeley et al.  2004). Non-maximizing behaviour may be justified as 
reasonable in an uncertain world if people are deciding quickly in in a systematic way. Then, limits on human cognition will mean that judgements and decisions are prone to behavioural biases. Procedural rationality is something like Thaler’s (2000) concept of quasi-rationality in which people make their decisions in a purposeful, regular way but their decisions are reasonable  in the sense that the reasoning process is not consistent with 
the axioms seen in standard economic analyses.
Ecological rationality
Vernon L. Smith (2003) analyses the different versions of rationality that are seen in dif -
ferent contexts, especially to explain contrasting behaviour in experimental markets. In a vision of rationality drawing on the Austrian economists, particularly von Hayek, Smith observes “we have examples where people don’t do as well as rational models predict. We have examples where they do better. And we are trying to understand why.” For example, financial asset markets do not converge quickly and, in the lab, may exhibit instabilities  37 HEUrIStICS an D D ECISI on -MakIng
such as bubbles and crashes even though, according to Smith, they do usually converge 
in the end. Experimental consumer markets on the other hand often converge quickly.
Developing concepts of rationality seen, for example, in Hayek , who argues that effective 
social institutions are the product of conscious deductive reason. Vernon L. Smith develops the alternative but complementary concept of ecological rationality. Ecological rationality focuses on the ecology of the environment in which decisions take place. It is less about different types of agents and their levels of rationality and more about agents responding to different incentives in different institutional environments and contexts. There is an evolu -
tionary aspect to learning and rationality. “Social-grown” norms such as trust and reciprocity can lead to social, cooperative outcomes that are better than the market equilibria – as we saw in Chapter 2 in the context of trust games: when people trust and reciprocate then they will do better than if they choose independently of the people around them.
Heuristics and decision-making
The various conceptions of rationality outlined above allow that individual behaviour may or may not be fully rational depending on the circumstances and contexts. How do these views of rationality and behaviour translate into an understanding of every -
day decision making? In real-life, people use decision-making shortcuts – referred to in the behavioural economics literature as heuristics . Gigerenzer et al.  (1999) and Todd and 
Gigerenzer (2000) explain that the mind has an “adaptive toolbox” for decision-making involving heuristics, which are simple rules enabling smart choices to be made using minimal information and exploiting the structure of information given the environment context. Heuristics do not require careful deliberation but neither are they irrational. Heuristics are common-sense rules of thumb derived from experience and they may be procedurally rational because they are used by people to make relatively quick decisions in uncertain situations when a full assessment of available information is difficult and/or time-
 co
nsuming. Imitation, for example, qualifies as a “fast and frugal heuristic” saving 
time and effort in social situations (Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996).
Different classes of heuristics are characterized by “simple building blocks” capturing 
how the search for information is conducted. Heuristics can generally be distinguished according to how reasonable they are, although, without a clear algorithm to draw the line between what is rational and what is stupid, judging whether something is a sensible heuristic can be subjective. Generally, heuristics can be justified as procedurally rational and biases involve misjudgements of information and/or events. There may be some over -
laps. Whilst heuristics are generally reasonable decision-making tools given uncertainty, if they are misapplied then they may lead us into mistakes – what behavioural economists refer to as behavioural biases . So, whilst heuristics can be useful devices to enable quick and 
efficient decision-making, their use does not always lead to the best decisions.
Most ordinary people make common mistakes in their probability judgements. This 
reflects bounded rationality: information is mishandled reflecting limits on the cogni -
tive processing ability of the human mind (Gould 1970; Tversky and Kahneman 1974; 
 An
derson 1998). Anderson (1998) asserts that the problem originates in the input format of 
data, and in algorithms used: if prompted by clear signals, the human brain is able to deal with probabilities more effectively (Anderson 1998). For example, if 
 st
udents are  asked to 
judge the probability of two coincident events within the context of a  statistics class, then 38 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
they will know what to do. However, if outside their classes they are confronted with a 
problem requiring probability judgements in a situation in which it is not obvious that this is what is required, then they may make a judgement using instincts and intuition rather than statistical reasoning (Kyburg 1997).
Cognitive biases can be categorized into individual and group biases, and individuals 
will be affected by motivational biases and cognitive biases (Baddeley, Curtis and Wood 2004; Skinner 1999). Motivational biases reflect interests and circumstances and may link into principal-agent problems. They can often be significantly reduced with clearly de -
fined tasks and incentive structures. Overall, motivational biases are less of a problem be -
cause they are under rational control and can be manipulated using incentives. Cognitive biases are problematic because they emerge from incorrect processing of the information; in this sense they are not under conscious control, a theme also explored by Herbert Si -
mon in the context of unconscious rationality.
tversky and kahnem an on heuristics and biases
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) pioneered the analysis of heuristics, describing them as devices to reduce the complexity of tasks and to form intuitive judgements of probability. These often useful and sensible devices can also lead us into systematic mistakes. Tversky and Kahneman draw an analogy with visual perception: we judge the distance of an ob -
ject by our visual perception of its sharpness and clarity. Whilst often a useful guide, in 
specific circumstances it will be misleading: in fog we overestimate distances; in sunny weather we underestimate them
Tversky and Kahneman (1972, 1974) explore the connections between heuristics and 
biases for a range of heuristics commonly employed including representativeness, an -
choring/adjustment and availability. For Tversky and Kahneman, heuristics are intuitive decision-making tools but the problem is that a range of biases can emerge from the mis -
application of these quick decision-making tools. Tversky and Kahneman illustrate with some experimental examples of systematic mistakes from misapplication of heuristics. In describing their experimental evidence, they note that they encouraged their exper -
imental subjects to be accurate and rewarded them for correct answers to deter wishful thinking and other irrational influences not associated with the application of heuristics.
Overall, a large number of heuristics and biases have been identified and we cover 
only a selection here but a comprehensive range of the various studies can be found in Kahneman and Tversky’s (1982, 2000) edited volumes. See also Ariely (2008) for a simple introduction.
representativeness
The representativeness  heuristic is a principle of analogical reasoning in which people judge 
the similarity between events and processes to judge probability. Probabilities are judged by the degree to which A resembles B. Tversky and Kahneman (1974) use the example of Steve – if we are given information about him, information which is not objectively informative, such as that he is “very shy and withdrawn”, has “a passion for detail” then we judge the probability that he is a librarian by how much he represents our stereotypes about librarians . Attribution errors and belief bias are generated when  we decide  according  39 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
to stereotypes because personality-based explanations are over-emphasized and situa -
tional influences are under-emphasized.
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) identify six types of bias that emerge from this heu -
ristic: insensitivity to prior probabilities (base-rate neglect), insensitivity to sample size, 
misconceptions of chance including gamblers’ fallacy; insensitivity to predictability; the illusion of validity; and misconceptions of regression reflecting a behavioural version of Galton’s fallacy – as explained below.
Base-rate neglect and probability matching
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) observe that judgements are often insensitive to prior probabilities: “when worthless evidence is given, prior probabilities are ignored”. This is the problem of base-rate neglect. If people are given narrative information about an event, even if this information is essentially worthless, then it will lead people to disregard sta -
tistical rules. For example, Tversky and Kahneman describe one experiment studying the probabilistic judgements for two experimental conditions: in the first condition, the ex -
perimental subjects were given a sample of biographical/personality descriptions drawn from populations mixed of engineers and lawyers. There were two treatment conditions with different mixes of lawyers and engineers: in one condition there were 70 engineers and 30 lawyers; in the other there were 30 engineers and 70 lawyers. If the subjects were given no personal information about the sample then they correctly judged the 
 pr
obabilities – applying Bayes’s rule the ratio of the odds should be 5.44: it is 5.44 times 
more likely that an engineer will be drawn from Population 1 than from Population 2. When the subjects were given a biographical sketch of each person in the sample, then they ignored the base-rate frequency.
For example, in one experimental treatment the subjects were given information 
about a person in the sample called Dick. Dick was 30 years old, married, highly able and motivated, successful and well-liked. In this case the subjects judged the likelihood that Dick was a lawyer to be 50% regardless of whether he was sampled from Population 1 or Population 2. Subjects ignored the base rate and judged the description as equally repre -
sentative of an engineer and a lawyer. It seemed that the subjects were being distracted by narrative information, comparing their sample of subjects via judgements of representa -
tiveness and ignoring the prior probabilities.
A related bias is probability matching. Probability matching occurs when choices 
vary with the probability of different events. Bliss et al.  (1995) make a distinction be -
tween probability matching and base-rate neglect: base-rate neglect involves discounting the relative frequency with which events occur and probability matching occurs when reactions reflect the probabilities of the various consequences rather than the probability of the event itself. For example, World War Two bomber pilots were allowed either a flak jacket or a parachute, but the two together were too heavy to carry so they could not have both. Strafing from enemy guns was three times more likely than being shot down. The flak jacket was better protection against enemy guns; the parachute was bet -
ter protection against being shot down. Objectively, enemy gunfire was always more likely and so it was always better to take the flak jacket. Yet, on average, the pilots were observed taking flak jackets three times out of every four and parachutes on the fourth occasions (Lo 2001).40 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
Insensitivity to sample size
Insensitivity to sample size reflects an application of the representativeness heuristics in 
the sense that, regardless of sample size, people judge the likelihood that a particular sam -
ple result will be seen by reference to the equivalent population parameter. For example, in a sample of men, the average height will be 6 feet and the probability that the sample would have average height greater than 6 feet was judged to be the same whether the sample size was ten men or 1,000, yet the likelihood of unrepresentative sample averages  
is higher in small samples because outliers are less  likely to be diluted. Kahneman and 
Tversky illustrate  another aspect  with an urn experiment: one draw of five balls reveals 
four red and one white; a second draw of 20 ball reveals 12 red and eight white. Experi -
mental participants were asked which was more likely to be from an urn containing two-
thirds red balls and one-third white balls. People focused their judgements on the simple proportions: the draw of four red balls out of five (i.e. 80% red) was judged to be more representative than the draw of 12 red and eight white (60% red) when probability rules in fact show that a draw of 12 and eight is more likely.
Objectively, however, if probability rules are applied, then the draw of 12 balls is 
more likely to come from an urn with two-thirds red balls but the experimental subjects were essentially ignoring the fact that the draw of five was a smaller sample. Tversky 
and Kahneman also observe that judgements of posterior odds are usually less extreme than correct values, reflecting an underestimation of the impact of evidence. A  simple 
comparison of proportions should have led the experimental participants to the second answer but the participants seemed to be concluding that a sample draw of 80% red balls is more representative of an urn with mainly red balls than a sample draw of 60% red balls.
Insensitivity to predictability
This form of bias involves people discounting the reliability of evidence. For example, Tversky and Kahneman describe an experiment in which the experimental subjects were provided with descriptions of performance of a student teacher during a practice lesson. The subjects were then divided into two groups. One group was asked to evaluate the student’s performance; the other group was asked to predict the student’s career perfor -
mance in five years’ time. The percentile scores for the evaluations and predictions were “identical”: scores on career success were the same as scores on teaching performance in one lesson. Tversky and Kahneman argue that, in reality, the likelihood that performance in one lesson will properly predict future career prospects is relatively small. Tversky and Kahneman (1974) do not address the fact that, even when point estimates for predictions of a student’s future career success coincide, that does not mean that doubt is absent be -
cause doubt is captured via wider confidence intervals not different point estimate for pre -
dictions of future career performance; that is, a judgement of a probability is not the same as its weight but they introduce weighting functions into their analysis of prospect theory.
Illusion of validity and overconfidence
Interviewers will often overestimate their ability to judge the calibre of a candi -
date from a selection interview, even if they know and/or have prior experience of  41 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
unreliable interpretations of character and performance from previous selection inter -
views. Another illustration of this problem is that the internal consistency of a pattern 
is judged to have more reliability than a less internally consistent pattern. The internal consistency leads to a judgement of representativeness, for example the application of intuitive, heuristical principles leads a teacher to conclude that a student with an exam record of BBBBB is more obviously representative of a B class student than another stu -
dent with an exam record of ACBAC. Tversky and Kahneman argue that this is another form of bias because highly consistent patterns are more likely to contain redundant elements and/or strong correlations between elements, for example for a student who gets two Bs in Spanish and Italian: both these scores are picking up similar things and are more likely to be correlated. Yet an A in maths and a C in history are likely to be independently determined and these independent elements combined are giving more reliable information overall that the student is on average a B standard student. Predic -
tions based on a set of independent, uncorrelated elements are more likely to give an accurate answer than predictions based on a set of related, highly correlated elements, but people judge a set of correlated elements as being more reliable because they are more representative.
The illusion of validity may create other biases such as overconfidence (a particular 
problem in financial markets, as we will see in Part II) and self-serving bias. These will mean that a person will be more likely to claim responsibility for successes than for fail -
ures. Overconfidence is especially a problem for extreme probabilities (close to 0% and /
or 100%) which people tend to find hard to assess.
Misconceptions of regression
Misconceptions of regression link into Galton’s fallacy about regression towards the mean and Galton’s (1886) empirical observation that tall men are more likely to have sons shorter than themselves. This is because there are random elements in the determi -
nation of a man’s height (as well as non-random aspects such as genetic make-up, etc.). Outliers are outliers partly because of large random errors. So, if the very tall man is an outlier reflecting a large positive error component in his height, then his son’s height is unlikely to reflect the same magnitude of error and the son will be shorter than his father. Mean reversion and convergence do not reflect causal mechanisms; they are just statistical tendencies.
Tversky and Kahneman apply this insight to heuristics and biases. If a child performs 
very well on one test then his performance in the next is likely to be disappointing just because of mean reversion, but people will assign spurious causal explanation, reflecting the fact that the output (e.g. a prediction about a child’s performance) should be represent -
ative of the input (the child did well in a previous test). In reality, a bad performance after a good performance just reflects a statistical tendency, just as very tall fathers are more likely than shorter fathers to have sons who are shorter than themselves.
Tversky and Kahneman argue that there will be some worrying behavioural impli -
cations for punishment and reward. If someone is rewarded for doing well, but then is just statistically more likely to do less well, rewards will be associated with deteriorating performance. On the other hand, if someone is punished for poor performance, and their performance improves just because of mean reversion, then punishments will be 42 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
mis-attributed to  improving performance. Iterating to the impacts on the person who is 
rewarding and punishing in some sense: punishment is rewarded and reward is punished.
representativeness and the conjunction fallacy
Another illustration of the representativeness illustrates another way in which people misap -
ply statistical rules when judging the probability of a conjunctive event. Conjunctive events 
are events that are not independent of each other. For example, if an urn contains three red 
balls two white balls, a red ball is drawn on the second draw , and is not returned to  the urn, 
then this will affect the chance that a red ball will be drawn on the third draw. However, if the red ball is replaced, then the draw of a red ball on the second and third draws are dis -
junctive events – the chances of one occurring does not affect the chances of another occur -
ring. One behavioural bias identified by Kahenman and Tversky links to a set of conjunctive events and is labelled the conjunction fallacy. There are many illustrations of the conjunction fallacy and a classic is the “Linda problem” (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983):
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As 
a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Please check off the most likely alternative:
1.
 Li
nda is a bank teller.
2. Li
nda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
In this, there is an interaction between representativeness and the conjunction fallacy. In 
experiments, a large proportion of people will judge it to be more likely that Linda is a social worker active in the feminist movement, than that she is an unspecified sort of so -
cial worker even though the former is a subset of the latter and therefore statistically must be at most equally probable. If this problem is framed as a statistical question then most people with a basic knowledge of probability would realize that the conjunction of two events is less probable than each event alone.
So people can sometimes answer more accurately when the problems are expressed 
purely in probabilistic/statistical terms: that is, is event 1 more likely or not than a con -
junction of event 1 with event 2. Most people with a basic knowledge of probability would realize that two events coinciding is less probable than each event happening sep -
arately and independently. However, when confronted with the details about Linda, most people find the second option more likely than the first, simply because the description appears to be more representative of a feminist stereotype, and hence more plausible.
This is a conjunction fallacy : the former option is the most likely since the probability 
of the conjunction of two events can never be more probable than either event inde -
pendently, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. One circle captures the set of those who are bank tellers; the other circle captures the set of those who are feminists. The overlap of the two sets is smaller than each set along: that is, bank tellers who are also feminists is a smaller 
set than all bank tellers – whether feminist or not, or whether bank tellers or not. It is 
more likely that Linda will be in one of these whole sets, than in the intersection between them. In other words, a more precise set of characteristics is always at best equally (and usually less) probable than a set of more general characteristics. 43 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
availability heuristic
Availability is the heuristic of judging an event to be more likely if occurrences of the 
event can be easily recalled, for example large, more frequent classes of events are easier to recall (Kahneman and Tversky 1974). The availability heuristic will also lead to primacy and recency effects in which the first and last events in a series have a disproportionate impact on current judgments. The availability heuristic introduces a role for memory in economic analysis too – for example, Mullainathan (2002) analyses memory and bounded rationality. Kahneman and Tversky (1974) outline a number of biases that emerge from the misapplication of the availability heuristic including retrievability bias; imaginability bias and illusory correlation.
retrievabiIity bias/familiarity bias
This bias emerges from the fact that some classes of events are recalled more easily and if they are easier to recall then they will be judged as more numerous. This also links to a familiarity bias; we recall more easily people and events that are more familiar to us. For example, subjects were asked to listen to a list of names including a mixture of un -
familiar names and celebrity names. After they’d heard the list they were asked to judge whether the lists included more men or women. When there were more male celebrity names, the subjects erroneously judged that there were more males in the group; when there were more female celebrity names, the subjects erroneously judged that there were more females in the group. This was perhaps reflecting the fact that when they tried to remember the names on the list, they recalled the celebrity names more easily because they were more available.
Effectiveness of search
If people are searching for instances of events and they can identify instances quickly and easily then this effectiveness of search will lead to an upward bias in the probability Bank tellers
Feminist sBank tellers who 
are feminists 
Figure 3.1   Illustrating the conjunction fallacy: the Linda problem44 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
judgement. For example, if people are asked to decide whether or not it is more common 
that words have “r” as a first letter or as a third letter, they will be able to search more ef -
fectively recalling instances of words that begin with “r” and this will lead them to judge that words beginning with “r” are more frequent than words with “r” as a middle letter, even though English words with a middle letter “r” are more common than those with a starting letter “r”. Similarly, people find it easier to recall abstract words such as “love” than concrete words such as “door”. Kahneman and Tversky argue that this is because people can more easily recall contexts including love than contexts including a door – and perhaps emotional salience is playing a role here too.
Imaginability bias
Events that can be generated or “imagined” are easier to recall and, via the availability heuristic, will be judged more likely. Kahneman and Tversky illustrate with an example of an adventurous expedition. When people are asked to judge the risk of an expedition, if they can imagine many dangerous, uncontrollable contingencies then they will judge the trip to be very risky. If they cannot easily conceive of the dangers involved then they will judge the trip to be less risky. The evaluation of risks will not necessarily coincide with any objective likelihood. For example, if people are comparing the likelihood of the relative risks of a trip to Antarctica or a trip to the jungle, then they may be able to imagine many more dire contingencies for the latter because more people have travelled to the jungle than have travelled to Antarctica. Therefore, they may decide that a jungle trip to be more risky than an Antarctic trip, just because they don’t know much about the risks in Antarctica.
Illusory correlation
This bias occurs when people imagine correlations between events because the features of the events fit together. Tversky and Kahneman cite evidence from a study in which ex -
perimental subjects are presented with two sets of information about patients: a drawing and a clinical diagnosis. Afterwards, the subjects were asked to judge the frequency with which a diagnosis such as paranoia or suspiciousness coincided with particular features from the drawings (e.g. “peculiar eyes”). Subjects significantly overestimated the actual frequency of some coincident events: for example, if they were asked how many times they had seen a picture of someone with peculiar eyes and a diagnosis of paranoia, they would significantly overestimate that set of coincident events, but these positive correla -
tions reported by subjects, for example between suspiciousness and peculiar eyes, were illusory. Kahneman and Tversky attribute this to an “associative bond” between events, for example suspiciousness is popularly associated with peculiar eyes.
attention bias and the availability heuristic
Another bias emerging from the misapplication of the availability heuristic, not specifi -
cally identified by Kahneman and Tversky (1974) is attention bias. Earl (2005), in devel -
oping some axiomatic foundations for psychological economics, focuses on the impact of attention bias when attention cannot be allocated optimally. In this case, choices will be  45 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
fickle, susceptible to random influences and context, for example in the case of fashions 
and fads. Attention bias may emerge from a misapplication of the availability heuristics leading to misjudgements based on past events and information easily recalled because they are attention grabbers, for example including primacy and recency effects – that is the first and last pieces of information that people receive.
Attention bias can also lead people into misguided predictions about the future. If 
events have recently caught people’s attention then they will affect perceptions of the likelihood of similar events in the near future. This is why insurance companies do well after a spate of disasters. Attention bias will also affect perceptions of terrorist attacks 
 (G
igerenzer 2004). Similarly, attention bias and the availability heuristic may cause re -
searchers to recall the most interesting, attractive or complex field examples rather than those that are most often encountered, biasing their future interpretation. There may also be limits on attention and, for example, a limited attention bias may lead to overbidding in auctions or when supermarket shopping (Malmendier and Lee 2011).
anchoring and adjustment
Anchoring and adjustment is a single heuristic that involves making an initial estimate of a probability called an anchor, and then revising or adjusting it up or down in the light of new information (Tversky and Kahneman 1974). This typically results in assessments that are determined by an anchor value or reference point, as explored in more detail in the next chapter – in the context of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory. For example, in deciding about an appropriate wage demand to make in the face of an uncertain economic environment, workers will tend to anchor their demands around their existing wage. Anchoring effects may operate in a social dimension too if one individual’s judgements is “anchored” to others’ opinions.
Kahneman and Tversky (1974) identify three specific biases that emerge from insuffi -
cient adjustment: biases in evaluating conjunctive events; biases in evaluating disjunctive events, and anchoring biases.
Insufficient adjustment
This bias occurs when probability judgements are anchored to prior information or events and are not adjusted as the information or context change. Kahneman and Tver -
sky illustrate with an example of incomplete numerical tasks. Two groups of school students were given 5 seconds to estimate the answer to a numerical question: one group was given the task of estimating 8 ×  7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1; the other group 
was given the task of estimating 1 ×  2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8. Their time allowance 
of 5 seconds was not enough for most to have time for reflection. The group with the first problem estimated 512; the second group 2,250. The correct answer is 40,320. The estimate for the first expression was higher than for the second and Kahneman and Tversky argue that this reflected anchoring onto the first number: the group anchoring onto the starting value of 8 came up with higher estimates that the group anchoring on a starting value of 1. Both groups underestimated the true answer by a substantial degree, reflecting incomplete adjustment  – they hadn’t had time correctly to extrapolate to the 
large correct answer.46 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
Evaluation biases
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) discuss biases that emerge when people are asked to eval -
uate conjunctive and disjunctive events, linking to the evaluative biases associated with 
the conjunction fallacy, as illustrated above with the Linda problem. Further problems with probability estimates from conjunctive and disjunctive events reflect anchoring and adjustment. For example, Tversky and Kahneman give an example of an experiment in which subjects could place bets on events. There were three types of event:
A: simple event of drawing a red marble from a bag containing 50% red marbles and 50% white marbles. The objective probability of this event is 0.50.
B: A conjunctive event specifically drawing a red marble seven times in a row from a bag containing 90% red marbles and 10% white marbles, with replacement of the marble after each draw. The objective probability of this event is 0.48.
C: A disjunctive event specifically drawing a red marble at least once at some stage in seven draws (with replacement) from a bag containing 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles. The objective probability of this event is 0.52.
Then the subjects were offered two sets of choices:
1. When offered a bet between the simple event and the conjunctive event, subjects preferred to bet on the conjunctive event, even though the conjunctive event was less likely.
2. When offered a bet between the simple event and the disjunctive event, the subjects preferred the simple event, even though the simple event was less likely.
The subjects’ intuitive judgements of probabilities inverted the objective probability rank -
ing. Kahneman and Tversky attribute this to anchoring and adjustment asserting that peo -
ple are judging the probabilities relative to a starting point with incomplete adjustment downwards or upwards towards the reference point. In the case of choice 1 (between event A and the conjunctive event B), the probability of the elementary event in event B (a red ball) is 90%; this is the anchor point event and adjustment downwards  from 90% to 
48% (the true probability) is incomplete leading subjects to decide event B is a better bet.
For choice 2 (between event A and the disjunctive event C), the elementary event is 
event C (again a red ball), but in this case the bag was biased towards white balls and so the probability of the elementary event (a red ball) was 10%; adjustment upwards  from this 
point is incomplete leading subjects to decide that event A is more likely.
Kahneman and Tversky describe the directions of the anchoring bias in terms of 
metaphors of funnels and chains: the chain-like structure of conjunctive events leads to overestimation of probabilities. The funnel-like structure of disjunctive events leads to underestimation. Bar-Hillel (1973) explains: in the same way that the probability of events compounded using the logical operator “AND” is often overestimated, the probability of events compounded using logical “OR” is often underestimated. This sort of bias leads to an unbounded probability problem: subjects tend to overestimate each probability in a set of exhaustive and mutually exclusive scenarios and do not correct their probabil -
ity estimates when the set of exhaustive but mutually exclusive outcomes is augmented. These biases lead people implicitly to infer that the total probability of the set of possible  47 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
events is greater than one, that is, greater than certain, which of course is impossible 
(Anderson, 1998, p.15). On the other hand, probabilities of disjunctive events are under -
estimated, and this means that people will erroneously judge that the sum of probabilities of a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes is less than one, which – again – is impossible.
Assessment biases
Assessment biases reflect inaccurate calibration. If a person is asked to construct a sub -
jective probability distribution around their judgements, their probability distributions will reflect overly narrow confidence intervals. If a subject is calibrating probabilities on percentiles then values below the first percentile should be seen 1% of the time and values above the 99th percentile should also be seen 1% of the time. Overall, true values should fall within a 98% confidence interval. But experimental evidence reveals large, systematic departures with subjects revealing overly narrow confidence intervals. This phenomenon is seen in naïve and sophisticated subjects and is not eliminated by incentives or scoring.
Tversky and Kahneman attribute this to anchoring. There is insufficient upward ad -
justment from the mean to the 99th percentile and insufficient adjustment downwards from the mean to the 1st percentile. Overall this leads to confidence intervals that are too narrow. They describe a study in which quantities, for example air distances from New Delhi, were presented to subjects who were then asked to judge the 10th or the 90th per -
centile. Another group were given the median judgement from the first group and asked to assess the odds that the given value exceeded the true value. The first group was too extreme: they judged a probability of 10% for an event that occurred 24% of the time. The second group was too conservative; events that they judged 34% likely occurred in only 26% of cases.
Problems also emerge with the anchoring heuristic when people anchor onto mis -
leading or irrelevant reference points. Tversky and Kahneman give an example of a wheel of fortune experiment. For each subject, the wheel was spun to reveal a number and each subject was then asked to estimate the number of African nations in the United Nations. Their estimates were anchored on the number they span: subjects spinning a low number gave low estimates for the number of African countries in the UN; subjects spinning a high number gave high estimates. Ariely et al.  (2003) identify similar evidence of “coher -
ent arbitrariness” in a series of consumer experiences in which arbitrary anchors affected product valuations and hedonic experiences. Their experimental subjects were shown six products including computer accessories, wine, chocolates and books. They were asked if they would buy these products for an amount equal to the last two digits of their social security number (SSN). Then they were asked to reveal their willingness to pay (WTP). Subjects with SSNs above the median reported significantly higher WTP than subjects with SSNs below the median. For example, a subject with an SSN in the top quintile was willing to pay $56 on average for a cordless computer keyboard versus a WTP of $16 on average for subjects with bottom-quintile SSNs.
Cognitive balance and cognitive dissonance
In the sections above we have focused on Kahneman and Tversky’s taxonomy of heu -
ristics and associated bias. Their work spawned a very large literature, some of which 48 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
is collected  together in the edited volumes Kahneman et al.  (1982) and Kahneman and 
Tversky (2000). There are other distortions in decision-making – similar to heuristics 
and bias but explored in separate literatures. One that is particularly relevant to behav -
ioural economics is cognitive dissonance . Economic analyses of cognitive dissonance are de -
veloped by economists by bringing in insights from cognitive psychology – specifically from cognitive balance theory. Cognitive balance theory explores cognitive function -
ing, including interactions of cognition and emotion, and cognitive dissonance. Heider (1958) developed cognitive balance theory to analyse the extent of congruence between expectations and outcomes, an issue also of central interest in economics. People seek consistent 
 pat
terns and cognitive balance. When there is cognitive imbalance people 
will act to return themselves to a state of psychological balance. For example, if you respect your friend but your friend likes watching The X Factor (which you hate), then you will adjust your perceptions so that either you respect your friend less or like The X Factor  more.
Festinger’s (1957) analysis of cognitive dissonance draws on similar themes, devel -
oped by Hirschman (1965) who defines cognitive dissonance as
a person who, for some reason, commits himself to act in a manner contrary to his 
beliefs, or to what he believes to be his beliefs, is in a state of dissonance. Such a state is unpleasant, and the person will attempt to reduce the dissonance.
(Hirschman 1965)
When unexpected or undesirable events occur, people reinterpret events and information 
to fit their prior beliefs about how the world is or should be. When people behave in a way which is contrary to their beliefs about themselves this creates cognitive dissonance between their beliefs and experience. In response, they act to try to remove the disso -
nance. This creates belief biases, for example when we interpret events and information to fit our preconceived notions as a device to overcome cognitive dissonance. This is done unconsciously. If we believe something then we will perceive that it has a logical basis, even if that logical basis is imagined.
A type of cognitive dissonance also affects political attitudes when perceptions of the 
logical basis for an assertion are determined by beliefs in the conclusion, not necessarily the objectivity of the assertion; for example, if a Republican voter believes that healthcare should be privatized then they are more likely than a Democrat to perceive that critiques of publicly-funded healthcare have a logical, objective basis. Similarly, if a person is reli -
gious and believes that God created the earth then they are more likely than an atheist to believe that the theory of intelligent design has an objective basis.
Akerlof and Dickens (1982) apply psychological insights about cognitive dissonance 
to an economic model based on three basic preferences: first, people have preferences not only over states of the world but also over their beliefs  about states of the world; sec -
ond, people have some control over their beliefs; and third – beliefs persist over time. The cost of the belief is the cost associated with mistakes made because of the belief. For example, people have a preference for believing that their workplace or environment is safe. The cost of their belief relates to the mistakes that emerge when reality and beliefs are mismatched. Believing that you’re safe may lead people to behave in a reckless way by not wearing radiation safety badges in nuclear plants, or by failure to buy earthquake  49 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
insurance when living in an earthquake zone. People in dangerous jobs must rationalize 
their choices: working in an unsafe place is not smart, therefore working in an unsafe place creates cognitive dissonance. This can be reconciled if the worker adjusts beliefs towards thinking that the workplace is safe.
Akerlof and Dickens describe a range of experimental evidence that supports their 
three basic premises. In one study, students were asked to insult other students by describ -
ing them as “shallow, untrustworthy and dull”. The students making the insults adjusted their attitudes towards their victim reflecting cognitive dissonance: they believed them -
selves to be nice people: nice people don’t insult other students without justification. So the only mentally internally consistent conclusion to reach is that the other students must have been shallow, untrustworthy and dull. People who engage in anti-social, aggressive or violent behaviour may reconcile their behaviour with their fundamental belief that it is wrong to behave violently by rationalizing and believing that they were provoked. 
 Ake
rlof 
and Dickens cite another study of cognitive dissonance in weight reduction: if dieters are set difficult tasks for weight reduction, then they must justify these difficult tasks as worthwhile otherwise it would be foolish to undertake them. This generates persistence in beliefs. Weight-watchers with difficult goals are more likely to have sustained weight loss than groups with more modest goals because those with different goals have had to modify and reconcile their beliefs to achieve the initial weight loss, and their modifica -
tion of beliefs is more likely to persist.
❖ Case study: ene rgy and the environment
Heuristics, biases and folk wisdom in environmental decision-making
Social information is used when households anchor their energy consumption deci -
sions around socially determined reference points. Without a reference point, infor -
mation about embedded emissions is of little use to the consumer because they do not understand technical information and more easily understand social comparisons  as a 
type of reference point ; for example, efforts to introduce carbon labelling, by the French 
supermarket chain E. Leclerc, focused not just on information about carbon emissions per kg for specific products but also total carbon footprints for 
 tr
olley-loads of food, 
as well as social comparisons with the average trolley footprint (Guenther et  al. 2012).
In explaining these biases in choices related to energy and the environment, behavioural 
economists focus on the idea that people are limited in a world of bounded rationality because of constraints on information, knowledge and learning. Shogren and Taylor (2008) draw on Mullainathan and Thaler (2000) in identifying three aspects to limits on rational behaviour as seen in environmental behavioural economics: bounded ration -
ality, bounded willpower and bounded self-interest. Just increasing the availability of information is not necessarily the simple solution it seems; Leiserowitz et al. (2012) note that often, the behaviours that would be most effective (e.g. driving cars less often) are neglected in favour of the less arduous behaviours such as switching off lights. Knowl -
edge and belief are not enough and just because people have knowledge about the ben -
efits of environmental actions does not mean that they will engage in those actions.50 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
One fundamental constraint on rationality is lack of knowledge, though Stern (2000) 
argues that knowledge is just a necessary component in engineering environmental behaviour change; it is not sufficient in itself. Pongiglione (2011) emphasizes the role of knowledge in a behavioural analyses of climate change and individual decision-
 
ma
king. In risky situations, deep psychological mechanisms propel people towards in -
action and apathy and this constrains pro-environmental behaviour. Behaviour change requires a combination of understanding, procedural knowledge and self-interest.
Problems emerge because self-interest interacts with subjective perceptions, limited 
knowledge and imperfect information. Procedural knowledge, including practical in -
formation about ways to reduce environmental impact, is particularly important as it enables people to turn subjective beliefs into concrete actions (Kaiser and Fuhrer 2003). Similarly, Reynolds et al. (2010) focus on knowledge deficits to explain environ -
mental inaction and empathy gaps. Pongiglione argues however that it is not all about knowledge deficits. The main obstacles to behaviour change reflect interplaying fac -
tors. Perception, self-interest and limits to knowledge all play a role – here knowledge includes awareness, understanding and procedural practical common-sense knowl -
edge about energy efficiency and the environment.
Biases in environmental decision-making are exacerbated by uncertainty about the 
future, as well as knowledge about the present. Decisions between risky alternatives will affect both firms and households: firms in their investment decisions and house -
holds in their energy consumption decisions and in purchases of lumpy consumption goods such as refrigerators and boilers. Uncertainty will have a profound impact on consumption and investment decisions. Carbon labelling can reduce consumers’ un -
certainty about the impact of their purchases, but labelling can provide some guid -
ance to environmentally conscious consumers. The question of how emissions should be measured and reported remains. Best practice would involve calculating emis -
sions over the life cycle of a product – in its manufacture as well as its end-use. For many products, however, life-cycle emissions are uncertain. How do you calculate the end-use emissions from shampoo given the variability in its use? For example,  end-use emissions will depend how long someone spends in the shower and the heat of the water.
Sunstein (2006) analyses the role played by the availability heuristic in people’s in -
tuitive cost–benefit analysis of climate change. He argues that if people have re -
cently experienced serious tangible harms from climate change then climate change 
will be perceived as a more salient problem. People are also affected by bounded 
 rat
ionality and cognitive limitations when assessing quantitative information about 
the environment.
Hartman, Doane and Woo (1991) explore status quo bias in energy consumption. 
They conducted a survey of electricity consumers who were asked about their pref -
erences for reliability and rates. Their responses fell into two groups: those with  51 tVE rSkY an D kaHnE Man  on HEU rIStIC S an D BIaSE S
a reliable  service and another group with an unreliable service. They found that 60.2% 
of the high reliability group wanted to retain their current contract even when the low 
reliability contract came with a 30% rate decrease; 58.3% of the group with the less reliable supplier wanted to stay with their existing supplier when offered the opportu -
nity to switch at a 30% increase in rates. Whilst to some extent their original choices may reflect underlying preferences, learning and/or habits, nonetheless Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler predict more switching and attribute the limited switching to a status quo bias (Hartman, Doane and Woo 1991; Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler 1991).
Status quo biases will lead people to stick with old habits and avoid change, and – to 
an extent – partly this may be an economically rational way of avoiding the transaction costs associated with change (Pongiglione 2011; McNamara and Grubb 2011). How -
ever, there is evidence that it is not just about transaction costs. For example, in the UK, switching energy supplier is a quick and easy process; if a customer decides to switch, the new supplier contacts the old supplier; cost comparison websites are eas -
ily accessible so overall the risks and transaction costs associated with a switch are small. Yet, even in the face of rising energy prices from the UK’s Big Six energy suppli -
ers, households do not necessarily apply competitive pressure by switching supplier. A 2011 YouGov poll commissioned by Anglian Home Improvements showed that 51% of respondents are likely to delay switching energy supplier and would prefer instead to ration energy, for example by wearing warmer clothing (YouGov 2011). This reluctance to switch may partly reflect a status quo bias/familiarity bias.
Kempton and Montgomery (1982) and Kempton, Feuermann and McGarity (1992) an -
alyse the use of heuristics and “folk methods” in energy consumption decisions and 
observe that miscalculations can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Infor -
mation about energy efficiency is often presented in a way that is intelligible to ex -
perts but esoteric to ordinary consumers. Research has shown that, in encouraging drivers to be aware of their fuel use, gallons-per-mile is more effective than miles-per gallon (Loewenstein and Ubel 2010). Also, bounded rationality leads to reliance on 
 he
uristics  – for example, people will adapt old methods to new situations when old 
methods will not provide the optimal solution. Consumers will use everyday reasoning including heuristics to speed up and simplify their measurement of residential energy decisions. The use of these folk methods is reasonable in the sense that it saves time and effort in computation but it does also lead to mistakes.
Kempton and Montgomery (1982) analyse folk quantification via interviews of 30 Michigan 
families, ten of whom were using energy-saving devices. These families also used “folk units”, for example familiar absolute measures such as gallons, dollars and  months 
to gauge their energy use. One householder conceptualized his energy consumption in terms of how many times per month he had to fill his oil tank. He did not conceptualize his energy decisions in terms of kilowatt-hours. People also focused on peak consump -
tion, for example a woman describing to her husband that insulation had reduced gas bills noted that they were no longer getting large $100 gas bills as they had before.52 HEUrIStICS an D BIaS
Kempton and Montgomery also identified a tendency to overemphasize certain forms 
of consumption. People overemphasized lighting as a drain on energy and were more likely to turn the lights off than they were to use less hot water – even though the lat -
ter had a larger impact. This overemphasis on lighting could reflect historical factors (lighting always used to be the biggest energy user) and/or problems of perception and categorization. Lighting output is more salient; we notice it more. It is also an ar -
chetypal representation of the broad general category of electricity use. People also focused on first-hand experiences and experiences of friends rather than impersonal, but objective, data summaries from organizations. Kempton and Montgomery found that householders focused on the dollar amount of their energy bills, neglecting the fact that consumption measured in dollars reflects price as well as volume. They also identified biases when people did not recognize that behaviour changes had had an impact on their bills. They were not recognizing that their bills reflected not only their water consumption changes but also price increases.
Households were also using folk methods to calculate savings from reducing en -
ergy consumed, and by focusing just on dollar amounts to make comparisons they 
neglected the impact of rising prices. This failure to incorporate rising prices, led to underestimation of the savings from reduced consumption. These problems also af -
fected energy investments, that is, by using simple payback methods without adjusting for price increases, folk methods led householders to overestimate how long it would take them to pay off their energy-efficient investments.
Overall, whilst heuristics are cognitively efficient in the sense that they are quick, easy 
to learn and useful for household budgeting, they also lead to systematic errors in quantification, ineffective energy conservation, increased vulnerability to online fraud and underestimation of benefits of investments in energy efficiency.
~
The studies explored in this chapter show that human decision-making is limited by the 
power of human cognition. The need to make quick decisions efficiently leads to the adoption of a number of heuristics and in many cases, these can lead to systematic biases in behaviour and choice. These biases cannot be explained in terms of standard assump -
tions though alternative behavioural approaches to decision-making can capture some of the heuristics and biases that characterize everyday decision-making.
Earl (2005) encourages policy-makers to recognize that people do not competently use 
statistical techniques and whilst this can distort perception and judgement, psychological economics can play a normative role by promoting better decision-making techniques. Thaler and Sunstein (2008) also explore the fact that whilst biases can create problems for the policy-maker, often biases can be exploited to encourage more socially beneficial be -
haviours. For example, too few people donate their organs, give blood or save properly for their retirement but the status quo bias can be exploited using default options. If default options are constructed so that donating blood or organs is the default, then people will be less likely to opt out of donating. Overall, donations will increase and more people will  53 rEVISI on q UE StIo nS
donate. A wide range of policy lessons from the application of ideas about heuristics and 
biases is explored in Thaler and Sunstein (2008) in the context of policy nudges, as we will explore in Chapter 9.
In developing an analytical framework for heuristics and biases, Kahneman and Tver -
sky provided a foundation for their innovative behavioural theory of risk: prospect theory . As 
we will explore in the next chapter, prospect theory provides an alternative to standard theory and can be used as an analytical framework in which key forms of bias are cap -
tured, for example biases related to loss aversion and framing effects.
Chapter  summary
 •Heuristics are quick decision-making rules of thumb and have been identified by many economists and psychologists – from Herbert Simon, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky through to Gerd Gigerenzer and Dan Goldstein – as important tools which people use to simplify their everyday decision-making.
 •Whilst heuristics often work well enough most of the time, sometimes they lead to behavioural bias.
 •Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky develop a taxonomy of heuristics, focusing on availability heuristics, representativeness heuristics and anchoring and adjustment.
 •Availability heuristics are based on using easily retrievable and engaging information, that comes quickly to the “top of the mind” – for example, recent events.
 •Representativeness heuristics are based on making comparisons with similar events and phenomena.
 •Anchoring and adjustment is about making decisions with respect to a reference point, and adjusting around that reference point, rather than “starting from zero”, as is the focus in standard economics.
 •Other constraints on choices and behaviour link to insights from psychology, for example, cognitive dissonance occurs when a person’s actions seem to conflict with their beliefs, and so they adjust their beliefs to eliminate these cognitive conflicts.

Prospects and regrets
In the previous chapter on heuristics and bias, we explored some of the limits on ration -
ality explaining some of the heuristics and biases seen in everyday decision-making. This 
literature is discursive and intuitive in style and so vulnerable to a criticism that it lacks objective rigour. In response, Kahneman and Tverksy (1979) developed these insights to construct their own alternative to expected utility theory (EUT) – the standard approach to risky choices embedded within the standard economic model of risk. Kahneman and 
Tversky argue that behavioural paradoxes cannot easily be explained by EUT but these can be reconciled using their prospect theory. But what is prospect theory? Prospect theory is a framework which captures how people choose between different risky “prospects” – defined as sets of risky alternatives. Prospect theory can reconcile behavioural inconsist -
encies without abandoning rigorous analysis.
There are two elements to prospects – their risk and their utility. This chapter starts 
by exploring some behavioural paradoxes that led to rethinking of standard approaches in the evolution of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory. Some of the limits on statis -
tical reasoning that might explain these behavioural paradoxes are then discussed leading into Kahneman and Tversky’s critique of expected utility theory. Then, Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory alternative to expected utility theory will be analysed, including its limits, developments and alternatives , including cumulative prospect theory, Thaler’s 
mental accounting model and Loomes and Sugden’s regret theory.
Behavioural paradoxes
Standard economic models are dependent on assumptions of rational consistent pref -
erences and so they cannot easily explain some behavioural paradoxes: instances in which people violate basic rationality axioms. In this section, a selection of these par -
adoxes will be explored including the Allais paradox, the Ellsberg paradox, the Monty Hall problem  and the St Petersburg paradox, as discussed by Allais (1953), Ellsberg 
(1961), Samuelson (1977), Bar-Hillel and Falk (1982), Nalebuff (1987) and Conlisk (1989), amongst others. 55 BEHaVIoUral  Para DoXES
St Petersburg paradox
The St Petersburg paradox is described by Samuelson (1977): Peter and Paul are playing a 
coin toss game. Peter suggests to Paul that he toss a fair coin an infinite  number of times. 
Paul will be paid 2 ducats if heads come up at the first toss, 4 ducats if he tosses a head at the second toss, 8 if he tosses a head at the third toss. Overall Paul’s payment will be 
2n where n 
is the number of coin tosses. The paradox in this game is that Paul’s reward will be infinite: assuming a fair coin, his chance of a head on the first round is ½ so his payoff for a head 
on Round 1 will be 
×=1221. For Round 2 his payoff will be () () ×+ ×= += 122 1441 12, 
and for Round 3 his payoff will be () () () ×+ ×+ ×= ++ = 122 144 188111 3, and so on. If 
Paul plays an infinite number of rounds then his expected payoff will be ∞. Therefore, a 
fair stake for Paul to place on this game is ∞ but he is unwilling to do this. He will only be 
willing to make a finite bet. This paradox is resolved by assuming that marginal utility is 
a decreasing function of wealth, that is, by assuming that Paul is risk-averse. The depend -
ence of EUT on the assumption of risk aversion is one of the key elements of Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) critique, as explained below.
allais paradox
Allais’s (1953) paradox describes inconsistencies in choice when people are deciding be -
tween options in two gambling games, one of which involves a certain outcome. Conlisk (1989) describes a set of gambles in which people choose between lotteries.
Gamble 1: Choose A or A*Lottery A
 $1 m
illion with certainty
Lottery A*  1% c
hance of zero; 89% chance of $1 million; 10% chance of $5 million
Gamble 2: Choose B or B*Lottery B
 89
% chance of zero; 11% chance of $1 million
Lottery B*  90
% chance of zero; 10% chance of $5 million
Standard economic theory predicts that a person with consistent preferences will choose B if they chose A, and B* if they chose A*. Which of these pairs they choose will depend on their aversion to risk. The expected value for A is less than the expected value for A* but the chance of zero is eliminated. Similarly, the expected value for B is less than the expected value for B*. However, experimental evidence shows that real people commonly choose the inconsistent combinations A*B and B*A. Choices are not completely random however and Conlisk observes a systematic pattern: violations of EUT more commonly involve the combination AB* than A*B. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) attribute the violations to a “certainty effect”, as we will explore below.
Ellsburg paradox
Ellsburg’s (1961) paradox can be illustrated with an urn game. An urn contains 90 balls: 30 are red balls and the remaining 60 balls are some unknown combination of black and yellow balls. Subjects were asked for their preferences over two gambles.56 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
Gamble 3:  If one ball is drawn from the urn, will you bet on:
a. re
d?, or
b. b
lack?
Gamble 4:  If one ball is drawn from the urn, will you bet on:
c. re
d or yellow?, or
d. bl
ack or yellow?
Subjects were given plenty of time to make their choices. Ellsberg found that many people 
prefer to bet on red in Gamble 3 and black or yellow in Gamble 4.
Ellsberg observes that this is a violation of the “sure thing principle” which requires that 
if a. is preferred to b.  then c.  should be preferred to d . Ellsberg attributes this inconsistency 
to ambiguity aversion in the face of Knightian uncertainty. As defined by Knight (1921), Knightian uncertainty describes fundamental uncertainty about unknowable probabilities. Knightian risk describes probabilities which can be quantified because they capture observ -
able, repeatable events which can be measured using frequency ratios or, in the case of Ells -
berg’s urn game, are given as prior information about proportions. In the case of Ellsberg’s paradox, the subjects know that the probability of a red ball is 0.33 because they are told that 30 of the 90 balls are red. They also know the probability of either yellow or black because they have been told 60 balls are yellow or black, though they do not know exactly how many are yellow and how many are black. So estimating the chances of red, and yellow or black are Knightian risk problems. On the other hand, they are given no information about the probability of a black ball versus a yellow ball. All they know is that the remaining 60 remaining balls are either black or yellow So estimating the chances of red or yellow, or red or black are Knightian uncertainty problems. There is no objective information on which people can form an objective, quantifiable probability judgement. Ellsberg observes: “it is impossible to infer even the qualitative probabilities of yellow versus black”. Abdellaoui et al.  
(2011) observe that when uncertain events are associated with probabilities that cannot be quantified something else is needed to resolve the paradox. They give a tractable quantitative method in which subjective probabilities are converted into a willingness to bet.
Bayes’ rule and the Monty Hall problem
Nalebuff (1987) describes a number of other paradoxes driven by people’s updating of probabilities – including a paradox often referred to as the Monty Hall problem . This par -
adox is interesting because its counter-intuitive natures has triggered much debate. Even  
some  statisticians struggle d to understand why the correct answer is correct because the an -
swer is counterintuitive. To understand the correct decision, we need to use a statistical rule known as Bayes’ rule – named after its inventor, the Reverend Thomas Bayes. Bayes’ rule sets out how to adjust our estimates of the chances of an event when new information comes along. We start with a prior probability  – based on all the information we currently have. Then 
some new information comes along and we update our prior probability using this new information to form a posterior probability  – which takes into account the new  information.
The Monty Hall version of this paradox is named in honour of Monty Hall who was 
the host of a TV show Let’s Make a Deal . Contestants are shown three curtains. A large prize 
is hidden behind one curtain, and small prizes are hidden behind the other two. The contestant makes a choice and then Monty Hall opens the curtain to reveal what’s behind one of the curtains not chosen and asks the contestant if they want to change their mind.  57 EXPEC tE D  UtIlItY tH EorY (E Ut)
If people are reasoning in a Bayes rational way then they should decide to change their 
mind. If they don’t then they are making a decision without properly updating their prior probabilities using Bayes’ rule.
Bar-Hillel and Falk (1982) show why this is the case in describing essentially the same 
problem set in a different context – the Three Prisoners problem. Tom, Dick and Harry are held in a jail. The next day, one of them will be executed and the other two will be set free. Tom, Dick and Harry’s prior probabilities of being executed are 1/3 but Dick is anxious and asks the jailor to tell him just whether Tom or Harry will be set free. No new information has been revealed about the probability that Dick  will be executed and so his 
overall chance of execution remains 1/3. The fact that this result seems counterintuitive to most people reflects the fact that human intuition is not probabilistic; often people struggle intuitively to understand statistical problems. Intuitive responses to this question reflect confusion, at least in terms of Bayes’ rule, about the conditional probabilities. Bar-Hillel and Falk explain the correct answer using Bayes’ rule, as outlined in the Mathemat -
ical Appendix A4.1.
Expected utility theory (EU t)
A fundamental aspect of Kahneman and Tversky’s analysis of prospect theory is their critique of expected utility theory. Concepts of expected value and expected utility were developed by Bernoulli and others from the 18th century onwards but only found their way into mainstream economics in the mid-20th century, most famously in von Neu -
mann and Morgenstern’s (1944) analysis of expected utility theory.
To enable an understanding of Kahneman and Tversky’s critique, a summary of some 
of the basic principles of EUT are outlined in Box 4.1. The von Neumann and Morgen -
stern preference axioms include transitivity, completeness, substitution, continuity and invariance. Transitivity means that if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C then A is preferred to C. Completeness means that in a choice between A and B, an individual will either prefer A, prefer B or be indifferent between A and B. Substitution implies that if two alternatives are identical then they can be substituted for each other – for example, if an individual is indifferent between two alternatives then they will also be indifferent be -
tween the alternatives if these are offered with equal probabilities. Continuity implies that if A≤B≤C then B can be expressed as a weighted sum of A and C. Invariance implies that the 
expected utility function can be scaled up without affecting the ordering of preferences.
Overall, these EUT axioms generate a theory in which people have stable, consistent 
risk preferences. As noted earlier in the context of the St Petersburg Paradox, by includ -
ing an assumption of risk aversion, the standard utility function becomes concave, as 
illustrated in Figure 4.1. Expected utility will increase at a decreasing rate and individuals will prefer averages to extremes. Given these axioms, Savage (1954) shows that expected utility is the product of a subjective utility function and a Bayesian subjective probability distribution (Savage 1954; Kahneman and Tversky 1979).
Figure 4.1 shows an example of a choice between £10 and £50. If a person is offered 
a choice between a 50% chance of £10 and a 50% chance of £50, then the expected value of this gamble is £30 but this gives utility at u
1 whereas a guaranteed £30 has a utility of 
u2 and u 2>u1. In other words, if a person has to be paid a certainty equivalent (the amount 
which makes them indifferent between the gamble and a guaranteed amount) of £35 to take a gamble with an expected value of £30 then they are risk-averse. EUT assumes that 58 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
people are risk-averse and the more bowed is the utility function, then the higher risk 
aversion will be. This is captured by the Arrow-Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion (ARA), which captures the curvature of the utility function using the change in marginal utility relative to its level. The coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) weights the risk parameter by consumption and further variants of ARA and RRA include constant abso -
lute risk aversion (CARA) and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). Ultimately, all these measures are similar in embedding stable, measurable risk preferences.
kahneman and tver sky’s critique of EU t
Kahneman and Tversky provide a critique of Savage’s (1954) approach to analysing de -
cisions between uncertain outcomes – the set of risky alternatives that Kahneman and Tversky call “prospects”. They assert that people do not necessarily reason using math -
ematical/statistical tools and this explains some of the behavioural paradoxes described above. Kahneman and Tversky set out some of the problems with EUT and then devise their own solution in the form of prospect theory – a model which enables us better to understand various anomalies in human decision-making.
In developing prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) start with a critique 
of standard expected utility theory (EUT) and explain how real-world behaviour is bet -
ter explained by prospect theory. Expected utility theory is both a normative theory – 
 ca
pturing how rational people should  behave; and a positive/descriptive theory – capturing 
how people do  behave. Many people probably would, in principle at least, prefer not to 
plan their lives in an illogical, inconsistent way so, as a normative theory, EUT has more merit  – even normative issues can be incorporated within it, as seen in models of ineq -
uity aversion – explored in Chapter 2. Normatively, if utility functions can be broadened properly to incorporate preferences for non-monetary sources of utility, such as equity, then most people would like to act in a way predicted by EUT.£50 £10 £30£Utility

Some of the mathematics underlying Kahneman and Tversky’s critique of EUT are 
outlined in the Mathematical Appendix A4.2. According to Kahneman and Tversky, the 
most profound problem with EUT is its legitimacy as a positive theory. The problem is that people don’t/can’t act as predicted by EUT: EUT lacks predictive power and so its role as a positive descriptive theory is compromised. Kahneman and Tversky argue that EUT does not provide an adequate description of human behaviour in the real world.
In their critique, Kahneman and Tversky focus on the Savage axioms underlying EUT 
including the expectation axiom (overall utility is the sum of the expected utilities), the asset integration axiom (acceptable prospects are those which integrate with wealth to give a utility greater than the utility of the wealth alone) and the risk aversion axiom, which holds if, and only if, the utility function is concave.
The expectation and risk aversion axioms are self-explanatory. The asset integration 
axiom can be explained by reference to an example: if a friend suggests a poker game in which you have to put down a stake of £1 for a 10% chance of winning £10 then that poker game is an acceptable prospect for you if and only if the utility of your new wealth (£10- £1 = £9) plus the utility of a 10% chance of winning £10 exceeds the utility of £10 alone – that is your starting utility if you decided not to play the game. According to Kahneman and Tversky, a key feature of the asset integration assumption is that utility is about final stages, not changes. One of the key features of prospect theory, as will be seen below, is the assumption that utility is determined by changes  not levels.
Kahneman and Tversky present experimental evidence showing a range of phenom -
ena associated with  real-world violations of these assumptions. They do acknowledge that 
reliance on evidence from hypothetical choices may not be valid. In particular, experi -
mental results – particularly as many of the experiments use university students as sub -
jects – may lack external validity and may not be generalizable to the wider population. However, Kahneman and Tversky defend their experimental approach on the grounds of simplicity: in investigating real choices you either need to see those choices in the field or in lab experiments and the problem with field experiments is that probabilities and utilities cannot easily be measured, whereas measurement is relatively straightforward in lab experiments because experimental conditions can be tightly controlled.
Kahneman and Tversky present evidence from Israeli, Swedish and US experiments 
in which students and faculty members were given a series of questionnaires in which they were asked to make hypothetical choices between a range of prospects. They found that people’s choices were not consistent with EUT and this finding was similar across all the samples. Kahneman and Tversky identify some common anomalous effects in people’s decisions: the certainty effect, the isolation effect and the reflection effect.
the certainty effect
This effect can be illustrated with Kahneman and Tversky’s example of two sets of choices: Gamble 1: a choice between A and B; and Gamble 2: a choice between C and D. This is essentially the same as the Allais paradox choice, described above, but with the scenarios tightened as follows:
Gamble 5: Choose A or BA: a 33% chance of 2,500, a 66% chance of 2,400, and a 1% chance of 0B: 2,400 with certainty60 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
Gamble 6: Choose C or D
C: a 33% chance of 2,500 and a 67% chance of 0D: a 34% chance of 2,400 and a 66% chance of 0
Note that, for this set of gambles, the difference in the expected values for A and B is 9, and the difference in the expected values for C and D is also 9. Also, the probability of a payoff of 0 is just 1% lower for B relative to A, and for D relative to C. So, in this sense, Gamble 5 and Gamble 6 are the same and the consistent choices are to pick C if you picked A, and to pick D if you picked B. Either of these sets of choices are justifiable under EUT. Which pair you choose will depend on how risk-averse you are. However, the real choices were inconsistent. Kahneman and Tversky found that actual choices were broadly simi -
lar to Conlisk’s (1989) finding as outlined above and 18% of people picked A but 83% of people picked C; similarly, 82% picked B but only 17% picked D. A substantial proportion of people picking B switched to C when they were no longer offered a certain prospect.
More precisely, for the choice between C and D, unless you are very risk-averse it 
would be sensible to pick C and indeed a large proportion of people (83%) did pick C; only 17% of people were sufficiently risk-averse to take the slightly reduced chance of getting nothing. You would expect a similarly low proportion of highly risk-averse people were confronting the choice between A or B. With A, there is just a very small 1% chance of getting nothing, yet many more people avoided it, suggesting extreme risk aversion. Only 18% of people preferred A to B, and 82% of people chose the certain outcome of 2,400. This suggests that people are overweighting certain outcomes – people behave very differently when offered a guaranteed outcome relative to how they behave when offered an outcome that is only slightly less likely, that is, very highly probable. Kahneman and Tversky call this effect the certainty effect and its existence is inconsistent with EUT.
The certainty effect is a violation of the substitution axiom and a further illustration 
of the Allais paradox, discussed above. Experimental evidence also reveals other violations of the substitution axiom. When the probability of one outcome is double the outcome of another, choices will depend on whether the probabilities are low or high. Kahneman and Tversky illustrate this with the following choice pairs:
Gamble 7: Choose A or BA: a 45% chance of 6,000,B: a 90% chance of 3,000
Gamble 8: Choose C or D
C: a 1% chance of 6,000D: a 2% chance of 3,000
For Gamble 7, 85% chose B. For Gamble 8, 73% chose C. Note that the amounts are the same. The probability of B is double the probability of A. The probability of D is double the probability of C. Even if the risk aversion assumption is relaxed, EUT predicts that a risk-averse person would pick the more likely outcome; a risk seeker would pick the larger payoff but Kahneman and Tversky’s evidence shows that people are not consistent in their choices between risky prospects: people’s choices shift depending on whether they’re choosing between low probabilities or high probabilities. When probabilities are small,  61 kaHnEMan a nD t VErSkY’S CrItIqUE oF E Ut
73% of Kahneman and Tversky’s subjects were picking the bigger but less likely payoff; 
when probabilities are large, 86% were choosing the smaller but more likely payoff. This suggests a nonlinearity in the value function – the function that captures the relationship between expected utility and the magnitude of payoffs, as explained below.
reflection effect
Kahneman and Tversky find further evidence of nonlinearity in the value function in experimental evidence about losses. Following Markovitz (1952) who identified the ten -
dency to seek risk when confronting losses, Kahneman and Tversky set-up choices in which their experimental subjects are choosing between losses, not gains. These experi -
ments provide more powerful evidence against EUT because risk preferences shift when people are choosing between losses. Preferences for losses are a mirror image reflection of preferences for gains, whereas EUT would predict a risk-averse person is just as averse when confronting losses as when looking at gains. To illustrate, Kahneman and Tversky compare the following choices:
Gamble 9: Choose A or BA: an 80% chance of 4,000 gainB: a certain gain of 3,000
Gamble 10: Choose C or D
C: an 80% chance of a 4,000 lossD: a certain loss of 3,000
For Gamble 9, Kahneman and Tversky’s experimental evidence showed that 80% of sub -
jects chose B. For Gamble 10, 92% of subjects chose C. Preferences for negative prospects, that is, losses, were a reflection of preferences for positive prospects: Kahneman and Tversky’s subjects avoided risk in the domain of gains but they were risk-seeking in the domain of losses. Kahneman and Tversky call this phenomenon the reflection effect and it reveals people taking greater risks to avoid losses, a phenomenon also linked to loss aversion – as discussed below.
Preferences for losses and gains were a completely symmetrical mirror image which is 
a clear violation of the EUT expectation assumption and so eliminates uncertainty aversion as the explanation for the certainty effect identified above. If people are 
 am
biguity-averse 
then a certain outcome has zero variance – so no ambiguity at all, and if someone is ex -
tremely risk-averse perhaps they will avoid outcomes associated with any sort of positive variance at all, no matter how small. But the reflection effect demonstrates unequivocally that ambiguity aversion is not the explanation because people are not ambiguity-averse when confronting losses.
Isolation effect
The isolation effect is about the fact that people disregard common components in al -
ternatives, whether those common components are the payoff or the probabilities. Kah -
neman and Tversky compare some choices in which preferences are altered by different 62 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
representations of probabilities even though , objectively , the choices are identical. For 
example, they analyse choices in a two-stage game, as follows.
Gamble 11: Choose A or B
Given a 75% chance of getting nothing and a 25% chance of moving to a second stage of choices, choose between A or B:A: an 80% chance of 4,000B: a certain payoff of 3,000
Gamble 11 is a two-stage version of the following one-stage gamble:
Gamble 12: Choose C or DC: 4,000 with probability 20%D: 3,000 with probability 25%
For Gamble 11, the chance of getting to stage 2 is only 25% and so all second-stage payoffs should be multiplied by 0.25 to reflect the fact that there is only a 25% chance of playing the second stage of the two-stage game. So, if A delivers 4,000 in the second stage, then the probability of 4,000 is 
×=0.25 80% 20% , and if B delivers 3,000 in the second stage 
then the probability of 3,000 is ×=0.25 1 25% .
Gamble 11 and Gamble 12 are essentially the same choice yet Kahneman and Tver -
sky’s subjects approached these gambles in different ways. For Gamble 11, 22% of subjects chose A and 78% B, but for Gamble 12, 65% chose A and 35% chose B. Their preferences were inconsistent and depended on the way in which the gambles were framed. Accord -
ing to EUT, people should focus on the probabilities of the final states but people are treating the sequential game as if it is a standard game. In the stage game they are ignoring the first stage.
Similarly, when the same payoffs are represented in different ways, people will make 
inconsistent choices as illustrated with the next set of prospects.
Gamble 13: Choose A or BImagine that you start with a positive endowment of 1,000 and have the following choice:A: a 50% chance of 1,000B: a certain payoff of 500
Kahneman and Tversky compare Gamble 13 with Gamble 14:
Gamble 14: Choose C or DImagine that you start with a positive endowment of 2,000 and then choose between:C: 1,000 loss with 50% probability (50% chance of 2,000; 50% chance of 1,000)D: 500 loss with certainty (1,500 with certainty)
For Gamble 13, the net payoffs from A are 1,000 with 50% probability and 2,000 with 50% probability. The net payoff from B is 1,500 with certainty. For Gamble 14, the net payoffs from C are a 50% chance of 1,000 and a 50% chance of 2,000 and the net pay -
off from B is a certain 1,500. The payoffs in Gamble 13 and Gamble 14 are identical yet  63 kaHnEMan  an D t VErSkY’S ProSP ECt tHEorY
choices were variable. For Gamble 13, 16% chose A and 84% chose B. For Gamble 14, 
69% chose C and 31% chose D. Preferences were not invariant. These experimental results were also consistent with the reflection effect because the preferences for losses were the mirror image of preferences for gains – again, inconsistent with expected utility theory but consistent with prospect theory.
kahneman and tver sky’s prospect theory
As we have seen above, Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) experimental results do not fit eas -
ily with the predictions of EUT and Kahneman and Tversky construct prospect theory to reconcile some common behavioural anomalies. They argue that choices are made as the outcome of two separate, sequential processes: an editing phase and an evaluation phase.
Editing phase
The editing phase is about simplifying the representation of prospects and there are a number of ways in which this is done including coding, combination and cancellation.
 •Coding : When prospects are coded as either gains or losses relative to a reference point, 
this reference point is not necessarily set at zero. In fact, the reference point is more often set by the status quo, for example a person’s current asset position.
 •Combination : Probabiliies associated with identical outcomes are combined. If a set of 
prospects includes a 25% chance of 200, another 25% chance of 200 and a 50% chance of zero, the 200 payoff will be combined into a 50% chance of 200.
 •Cancellation : Occurs when people disregard common elements in a set of choices set, for 
example ignoring first stages in sequentional decisions, or ignoring a common bonus as outlined in the isolation effect examples above. Other editing operations include simplifications such as rounding-up probabilities and payoffs to approximate amounts and discarding outcomes that are very unlikely. Editing will also involve the deletion of dominated prospects – that is prospects for which there is always a better alternative.
Editing does create the possibility of inconsistency and intransitivity because differences in prospects which are eliminated in the editing process may change the preference ordering of prospects, especially as the outcome of simplification will depend on the editing se -
quence and context. Kahneman and Tversky give the example of a choice between one pros -
pect involving a 500 payoff with 20% probability versus a 101 payoff with 49% probability and another prospect involving a choice between 500 with probability 15% and 99 with probability 51%. The second choices in both prospects might be simplified to a 50% chance of a 100 payoff and then the first prospect will appear to dominate the second whereas it would not have dominated if the choices had not been simplified in the editing phase.
Evaluation phase
After editing the prospects, the next stage is to evaluate the prospects so that the 
 de
cision-maker can choose the prospect with highest expected value. In this, Kahne -
man and Tversky develop insights from previous analyses, for example Markowitz (1952) who identified nonlinearities in utility functions rather than strict concavity, proposing a 64 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
model in which values are assigned to changes not final states. The process of evaluation 
will depend on the nature of the prospects available and specifically whether the prospect is strictly positive (all choices are gains and probabilities sum to 1); strictly negative (all choices are losses and probabilities sum to 1) or regular prospects – a combination of gains and losses and/or probabilities that sum to less than 1. Kahneman and Tversky state explicitly that this will lead to a model in which choices violate normative principles of choice and choices made may be inconsistent, intransitive and/or dominated by better al -
ternatives. This is the point of Kahenman and Tversky’s theory: they are aiming to explain the anomalies in real-world choices that cannot be explained by EUT.
the value function
In prospect theory, there are two elements to the value of the edited prospect: the decision weight assigned to each probability and the subjective value of the outcomes. According to prospect theory, subjective value is determined by changes in utility and specifically the subjective value of deviations from the reference point.
The essential features of the prospect theory value function are:
1. value is determined relative to deviations from a reference point, and this is not necessarily zero
2. generally the value function is concave for gains and convex for losses
3. the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.
It follows from (2) and (3) that the value function will be steepest at the reference point and Kahneman and Tversky’s hypothetical value function has an S-shape – as depicted in Figure 4.2.
Earlier points we explored about reference points and loss aversion are captured in the 
prospect theory value function as explained below.
reference points
Reference points play a central role in prospect theory as the anchor of the value function. In prospect theory the reference point is the status quo, for example the current asset po -
sition, but shifts in reference points may alter a person’s ordering of their preferences. If someone receives an unexpected tax bill then it may take them a while to adjust reference points and may lead to people accepting gambles that might otherwise be unacceptable , 
so their preferences will seem inconsistent.
Reference points link into the anchoring and adjustment heuristic explored in 
 Ch
apter  3 and prospect theory can help to explain these effects. Abeler et al.  (2011) discuss 
experimental evidence from subjects working on a tedious task: for example, counting the number of zeroes in tables of randomly ordered zeroes and ones. The incentives were a 50% probability of a fixed payment and a 50% probability of a piece rate payment. The differential reference points were established using two treatments – “LO” in which the fixed payment was 3 euros; versus “HI” for which the fixed payment was 7 euros. They found that effort provision was reference-dependent; the subjects in the HI treatment worked harder and for longer than the subjects in the LO treatment. 65 kaHnEMan  an D t VErSkY’S ProSP ECt tHEorY
Whilst reference points are central to prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky do 
allow a role for special circumstances too. If someone needs £60,000 to pay off some 
gambling debts, then their evaluation of a prospect to get some money will be particu -
larly steep around £60,000 but will flatten off beyond that point. This raises the issue of framing, addressed in developments of prospect theory, for example Thaler’s mental accounting model, which we will explore in Chapter 13.
loss aversion
Gains and losses are defined with respect to the reference point and Kahneman and Tver -
sky emphasize that losses affect value more than gains. This means that the value function will be steeper for losses than it is for gains. This can be seen in the illustration of the prospect value function in Figure 4.2. For a positive change 
∆=+1, the increase in value 
is given by VG. With losses of the same magnitude, that is, ∆=−1, the decrease in value is 
given by VL. In absolute terms, VL > VG; losses “loom larger” than gains.
Again, special circumstances may come into play. For example, for home-owners: 
aversion to losses may be particularly steep just at the point when a house is at risk of repossession because that loss will be associated with a larger, wider range of other losses. In this way, attitudes to money are not “pure”; they are complex and determined by a Reference pointGainsValue

whole range of factors and consequences meaning that value functions can shift from 
concave to convex regions and may even be linear in some regions.
the weighting function
Kahneman and Tversky assign weights to the probabilities of prospects, as captured by the weighting function and the mathematics are outlined in this chapter’s Mathematical Appendix A4.3. Building on empirical evidence cited in Kahneman and Tversky (1979, p. 280) five independent studies of 30 decision-makers identified concave utility functions 
for gains and convex utility functions for losses, with utility functions usually steeper for losses than for gains.
The weighting function is steep at its extremes and is discontinuous when probabilities 
are close to 0 or 1 because people do not know how to comprehend extreme events. They do not know how to weight extreme probabilities or even if they should weight them at all. This can be captured by recognizing that, in prospect theory, the scaling of the value function is complicated by the introduction of the weighting function. Decision weights can capture complexity of decision-making. They can transform linear value functions into nonlinear ones to capture risk aversion and risk-seeking. Kahneman and Tversky emphasize that their weighting function is not about degrees of belief, as is the focus in some other studies, for example, Keynes (1921), Ellsberg (1961) and Fellner (1961). Instead, decision weights measure relationship between likelihood of events alongside their probability. In EUT, the focus is on simple problems but in prospect theory, other factors beyond simple probability, such as ambiguity, determine desirability and this reflects decision weights.
The weighting function has a number of properties including overweighting, sub-
 
ce
rtainty and sub-proportionality. The sub-certainty property captures the fact that 
probabilistic outcomes are given less weight than certain outcomes, and this feature cap -
tures the Allais paradox. Sub-certainty will be more pronounced for vague probabilities than for clear probabilities. There is overweighting of very low probabilities and sub-
 
pr
oportionality captures the fact that the ratio of decision weights is closer to unity for 
small probabilities than for large probabilities.
Once the weighting of probabilities is incorporated into prospect theory, in contrast 
to the nonlinear utility functions from Markowitz, the expectation principle of EUT no longer holds. There will be violations of dominance reflecting the nonlinearity of the prospect theory weighting function. The editing phase has significant implications here: simplification of prospects during editing leads to very low probabilities being treated as if they are impossible and very high probabilities being treated as if they are certain.
Evidence from game shows
Post et al. (200 8) note that empirically testing EUT and prospect theory against each other 
is complicated by the joint hypothesis problem. There are two sets of unknowns: the true probability distribution is unknown to the subject and the subjects’ beliefs are unknown to the researcher. Game shows can resolve this problem in providing natural experiments that enable an experimenter to infer the players’ beliefs because the subjects are told that the probability distribution and the game itself requires minimal skill and strategy.
Post et al. analyse evidence from Deal or No Deal (DOND) games played between 2002 
and 2007 by 151 contestants from the Netherlands, Germany and the USA. The games  67 rEgrEt tHEo rY
were played in slightly different ways in the different countries but a typical version of the 
game involves each contestant picking one suitcase from a selection of 26 suitcases. Each suitcase contains a sum of money varying between 1 euro to 5m euros. Having selected her own suitcase, in Round 1 the contestant is invited to select one of more of the other suitcases to be opened. Once these other suitcases have been opened, the game’s banker offers to buy the contestant’s suitcase. The banker’s offer will reflect the average value of the unopened suitcases. If the contestant agrees on a deal to sell her suitcase to the banker, then the game finishes. If not, that is if the contestant decides “no deal” in response to the offer for her suitcase, then the contestant can see the contents of more and more suitcases (except her own) and the banker continues to make offers to buy the contestant’s suitcase. The game lasts up to 8 or 9 rounds and, in the final round, the choice is reduced to a sim -
ple binary choice in which the contestant faces a 50% chance of winning the larger sum when she decides between “deal” or “no deal”.
Post et al. find that the contestants’ choices reflect moderate levels of risk aversion and also 
exhibit reference dependence and path dependence, a result consistent with prospect theory. They predict the choices of contestants using EUT and prospect theory and then compare the predictions. EUT predicts 76% of outcomes but it fails to capture the evidence of path dependency seen in the contestants’ choices. A simple version of prospect theory predicted 85% of choices and captured the reference dependence and path dependence observed in the contestants’ choices. On the basis of this evidence at least, prospect theory outperforms EUT.
Cumulative prospect theory
Kahneman and Tversky admit that their theory has limitations. It cannot capture com -
plex choices, for example in bidding games. There will be violations of dominance and also prospect theory does not give insight into more complex tasks when more than two prospects are available, for example bidding processes. It does not capture more complex factors affecting attitudes towards prospects, including social norms, security, prudence and misinformation.
Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory was also criticized by others, for example be -
cause it led to violations of strictly rational choice. Whilst some choices can be removed in the process of editing, this does then mean that prospect theory predicts violations of the transitivity axiom, that is, suggests that people will make inconsistent choices. Whilst for some the point of prospect theory is  to capture the fact that people are not always consistent 
in their choices, it does nonetheless rest uneasily with an attempt to devise a structured account of decision-making. For this reason, Kahneman and Tversky developed cumulative prospect theory incorporating rank-dependent weightings in which only extreme unlikely events were overweighted, not all unlikely events (Tversky and Kahneman 1992).
regret theory
Loomes and Sugden (1982) formulate regret theory as a “simpler”, “more intuitive” al -
ternative to Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory. They analyse the behaviour of an individual facing a finite number of alternative states of the world. Each of these states has a probability which can be interpreted as either an objective probability or, if knowl-edge is absent, as a subjective probability. The individual must choose between actions where each action is some multiple of consequences broadly defined. Loomes and Sugden 68 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
develop their model in terms of consequences captured by changes in wealth but empha -
size that this is not essential for their theory. An innovation relative to prospect theory is 
that there is a clear link between actions, consequences and states of the world, whereas the concept of prospects does not associate consequences with states of the world. In regret theory there is one consequence for each state of the world whereas in prospect theory a number of different actions may correspond with each prospect.
Loomes and Sugden’s mathematical model is summarized in Mathematical Appendix 
A4.4. They construct a “choiceless” utlity function which captures the utility, the “psycho -
logical experience of pleasure”, derived from a consequence in the absence of choice. For example, the utility a person gets from housing allocated by government may differ from the utility from housing which has been chosen. Intuitively, the concept of choiceless utility introduces the possibility of regret, in a situation in which a person has a choice between two actions A and B but with consequences x and y dependent on a future state of the world which the decision-maker can neither choose nor predict in advance. If the person chooses action A then they will experience consequence x but they will none -
theless be aware that, if they had chosen B, then they would have got y. Their pleasure will depend not only on the consequences they chose via their action but also on the consequences from options not chosen. Loomes and Sugden illustrate with an example: an increase in tax rates leading to an increased tax bill of £100 is a choiceless consequence but losing £100 in a horse race is the outcome of a choice. Loomes and Sugden postulate that the decrease in pleasure will be greater in the latter case because it generates regret.
More generally, assume that a person chooses option A with a payoff x and rejects op -
tion B with a payoff y . If x is less than y then they will experience regret from choosing A 
and that will reduce their pleasure. On the other hand, if x is greater than y they will ex -
perience “rejoicing”; their pleasure will increase. Using these insights about rejoicing and regret, Loomes and Sugden construct a modified utility function which incorporates pairs of consequences for each state of the world. In regret theory, the utility function captures not only “what is” but also “what might have been”. These insights are combined into a restricted version of their model – the regret–rejoice function, which captures the rewards from a chosen strategy and also the differential between chosen and unchosen utility.
Loomes and Sugden assume that people maximize expected modified uility but do 
not claim that maximization is only objective consistent with rationality. Employing Friedman’s (1953) defence of positivism, they use this assumption because it gives predic -
tions consistent with empirical evidence. Loomes and Sugden explain that experimental evidence from Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) analysis of prospect theory, including the Allais paradox, isolation effects, reflection effects and preferences for contingent insur -
ance are all consistent with regret theory. Regret theory is also one of the early attempts to incorporate emotional factors into economic models and the role of emotions in eco -
nomic decision-making are explored in more detail in Chapter 9, which is about how moods and emotions affect choices.
Expected utility theory is difficult to reconcile with some of the heuristics and biases 
outlined in the previous chapter and Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory offers an alternative that captures many of the essential features of heuristics and biases. Some of the key insights include that losses are avoided more than gains are pursued and that people adjust to reference points and focus on changes rather than utility levels. Prospect theory is not without its limitations however and alternative theories including Loomes  69 rEgrEt tHEo rY
and Sugden’s regret theory capture some of the features of nonstandard decision-making 
that Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory does not capture.
In prospect theory and regret theory, models are constructed to capture behavioural 
paradoxes and limits to expected utility theory. These models suggest that human thought is not well-adapted to processing probabilistic and statistical information. As discussed in the previous chapter on heuristics and biases, research has shown that most ordinary people make common mistakes when they judge probabilities. Some biases may reflect a lack of data, an issue addressed in economic analyses that focus on incomplete and/or asymmetric information, uncertainty and risk  – but mistakes may also reflect cognitive 
limits on processing within the human mind if human brains are not well adapted to the format of data inputs and/or algorithms needed effectively to process the data.
In terms of policy, it is important to recognize that changes are important and that 
people decide according to their reference points. If policies can be designed to reset these reference points then this may lead to more effective decision-making, via defaults to exploit status quo bias, for example. In addition, framing effects will have significant impacts and reference points can be reset by changing the framing of a choice, for example expressing desirable choices in terms of potential gains instead of potential losses may lead to more ef -
fective decision-making by encouraging positive behaviours. Similarly, expressing undesira -
ble choices in terms of potential losses instead of potential gains may deter those behaviours. This connects with some of the nudge policies introduced in Chapter 9  and advocated by 
Thaler and Sunstein (2008) though it is important to emphasize that nudges can lead only to limited behaviour changes and deeper policy approaches will also be required.
There could also be a greater focus in policy-making on communicating informa -
tion in a way that suits our cognitive capacities. Anderson (1998) analyses the impact and nature of memes. Memes are the cultural equivalent of genes and a unit of imitation (Dawkins 1976; Blackmore 1999). Successful memes survive (are remembered) and repro -
duce (are transmitted) effectively in three cases: when they map effectively onto human cognitive structures, incorporate a standardized decision structure and have been rein -
forced by dominant members of the scientific community. By drawing parallels between memes and genes, evolutionary themes can be applied to the analysis of how memes spread knowledge and information. Lynch (1996, 2003) applies these insights in his anal -
ysis of the evolutionary replication of ideas and argues that “thought contagion” affects a wide range of human behaviours and beliefs.
These insights can be incorporated into policies which enable more effective 
 de
cision-making. As noted above, if students are asked to judge the probability of two 
coincident events within the context of a statistics class, then they kn ow how to apply 
their knowledge of statistical principles. Outside their classes however, when presented with essentially the same problem they may be unable correctly to answer because they misapply heuristics using instincts and intuition in a misleading way. To overcome these problems Anderson suggests that Bayesian approaches can be refined using the advantages of a frequentist approach, for example by using more mental/visual imagery to guide decision-making. If frequency ratios could be communicated to people in a more clear and accessible way, then human cognition might be able to process subjective probabil -
ities more effectively. For example, probabilistic information about the risks of different alternatives (taking a train versus driving, for example) could be represented in graphical or pictorial form. In the presenting information, attention could be paid to devices for 70 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
cognitive interpretation. When prompted by clear signals and steers, the human brain 
may be able to deal with probabilities more effectively.
Chapter summary
 •Kahneman and Tversky present prospect theory as an alternative to conventional eco -
nomic theories of risk – namely expected utility theory – to explain a number of behavioural paradoxes that expected utility theory cannot explain.
 •Prospect theory differs from expected utility theory in key ways, which reflect the special characteristics of their value function.
 •In prospect theory, people balance the chances of different prospects using a refer -
ence point as a starting point, not from a starting point of zero – as is postulated in expected utility theory.
 •Losses are treated differently from gains: losses loom larger than gains so that people care more about losing  money than gaining  an equivalent absolute amount of money.
 •Risk preferences shift along the value function capturing the idea that people do not have a single risk preference. Whether a person’s choices reflect risk-seeking or risk-avoiding behaviour will depend on the context and the balance of probabilities for one prospect against another.
 •Prospect theory has its own limitations and some of these are addressed in alternative behavioural theories of risk, for example Loomes and Sugden’s regret theory.

a4.2 kahneman and tve rsky’s critique of EU t
Developing von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) and Savage (1954), Kahneman and Tversky (1979) focus their critique of EUT on Savage axioms:
Expectation
 =+ ++ (; ;...; )( )( ) ... () 11 22 11 22 Ux px px pp ux pu xp ux nn nn
– total utility is equal to the expected utility of each outcome where x is the payoff 
and p is its probability
Asset integration  (,; ...; |) 11Ux px pw iff nn
 ++ > (, ;...; ,) () 11 Uw xp wx pu w nn
– a prospect is acceptable at asset position w if and only if its utility exceeds the 
utility of w alone
Risk aversion  ''0 u<
 i. e. total utility is increasing at a decreasing rate, total utility is concave.
The risk aversion tenet of EUT implies that people will prefer probabilistic insurance (PI) to contingent insurance (CI). Assume a person starts at a position of indifference between no insurance and contingent insurance:
−= −+ − () () (1 )( ) uw yp uw xp uw
where x is a negative prospect i.e. a loss, p is the probability of loss and y is the contingent 
insurance premium paid to avoid the loss.
To simplify, Kahneman and Tversky assume −= = () 0,() 1 uw xu w  which gives:
−= − () 1 uw yp
Kahneman and Tversky assume that a person will be willing to reduce their premium 
by a factor r to reduce the probability of losing x from  p to −(1 )rp and therefore:
−− +− +− −> − (1 )( )( )(1) () () rpuw xr puwy puwr yu wy72 Pro SPEC tS a nD rEgrEtS
This represents the amalgamation of risks characteristic of PI. In addition to the risk 
of a loss, there is also a risk with the PI policy: in the case of a loss you have some chance 
of being covered by insurance and some chance of facing the full loss yourself.
Again assuming −= = () 0,() 1 uw xu w  and −= − () 1 uw yp  gives
−+ −− >− (1 )(1) () 1 rp pp uw ry p
∴ −> − () 1 uw ry rp
a4.3 Mathematics of prospect theory
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) define a prospect as a set of probabilistic outcomes, e.g. 
(,; ...; ,) 11xp xpnn . To capture some the essential elements of prospect theory Kahneman and 
Tversky compare very simple prospects, e.g. (,;,)xp yq in which a person receives x with 
probability p and y with probability q or nothing with probability −−1pq where +≤1 pq .
A strictly positive prospect involves positive outcomes, a strictly negative prospect 
involves only negative outcomes. A regular prospect involves both losses and gains, e.g. 
(,;,)xp yq is a regular prospect if 1, 0, 0 pq xy orxy +< ≥≥ ≤≤ .
Kahneman and Tversky observe that their prospect theory involves relaxing the ex -
pectation principle of EUT. The value of a prospect is captured by the subjective value of the outcome 
()vx and its decision weight – π()p.
the value function
Kahneman and Tversky’s value function captures the values and weights of the prospects as follows:
ππ=+ (,;,) () () () () Vx pyqp vx qvy
This value function is illustrated in Figure 7.2. It has three main features:
(i) it captures deviations from a reference point not final states, i.e. gains and losses relative to the reference point;
(ii) it is usually concave above the reference point, i.e. for gains, and convex below it, i.e. for losses, i.e. 
() 0, 0; () 0, 0, vx forx vx forx ′′ <> ′′ ><
(iii) it is steeper for losses than for gains, i.e. ′<′− () () vx vx .
the weighting function
A probability weighting function can be described as:
 π π+−() (1 ) pp
It will exhibit the following properties, given <<01 r:

a4.4 Mathematical summary of loo mes 
and Sugden’s regret model
Loomes and Sugden start by assuming that there are many states of the world j and each 
state of the world j has a probability <≤01 pj with ++ +=... 1 12pp pn. People choose an 
action i and its consequences x (defined for the purpose of illustration as changes in 
wealth) are determined by j . Choiceless consequences are used as a benchmark and the 
pleasure from choiceless consequences is given by ()Cx.
Given uncertainty, for actions =1,2 i  if the person chooses action 1, i.e. =1 i then, in 
addition to the direct pleasure derived from 1xj there are additional emotional sources of 
pleasure, i.e.:
Regret when >21xxjj
Rejoicing when <21xxjj
A modified utility function is constructed by defining = ()Cx c ij ij  to give:
= (, ) mM cc ijkijkj
Simplifying, the modified utility function gives a regret–rejoice function:
=+ −() mc Rc c ijkij ij kj
R(.) captures the differential rewards from choosing action i. R(.)  = 0 is t he limiting case 
consistent with expected utility theory but Loomes and Sugden assume that R(.) is strictly increasing and three times differentiable.Chapter 5
learning
The links between economic and psychological theories of learning have evolved along 
different paths – economic theories via insights from game theory, and psychological theories from a rich and varied range of sub-disciplines. Behavioural economics ties them together – specifically via links between economic models and behavioural psy -
chology and this chapter explores how economic models of learning and behavioural psychology  connect.
“To learn” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of English as “to gain knowl -
edge of or skill in by study, experience or being taught”. Teaching is a more complex 
 ac
tivity – associated with higher animal species and it is distinct because it involves some 
form of self-sacrifice by the teachers. In economists’ language – the teacher faces oppor -
tunity costs in their teaching activity and so it has elements of altruism. We will abstract from the complexities of teaching here and focus just on learning – as activities associated with updating knowledge. Camerer (2003a) observes, economic theory sometimes ne -
glects questions of learning. If knowledge is perfect and people are strictly rational, then the correct choice can be identified from the start and people will jump from one equi -
librium to the next only when information changes.
More recently, economic models have analysed equilibrium in the presence of im -
perfect or asymmetric information but Camerer (2003) argues that these models tend to focus on limit properties; if it takes a long time to reach the limiting behaviour, predicting the path of equilibration is potentially a lot more useful and interesting. In understanding 
how equilibrium is reached, experimental evidence is often more practically useful than theory but collecting reliable experimental evidence can also be problematic.
Camerer and Weigelt (1988) emphasize the importance of learning in experimental 
games, for example in trust games, public goods games and beauty contests. Camerer (2003) also outlines some characteristics of a good learning theory: it should be parsimo -
nious, it should have predictive power and coherence but at the same time it should reveal new insights. Camerer (2003) describes learning models in the context of quantitative time-dependent functions of strategies known as attractions , which are like a stock of learn -
ing that builds up over time as new information comes along. Different learning models  75 BElIEF lEar nIn g
are characterized according to the learning rules which update these attractions, as will 
be illustrated below in the context of some learning theories.
Learning theories can be grouped into a few broad categories: evolutionary ap -
proaches, and reinforcement versus belief learning models (including hybrids of these, 
e.g. Camerer and Ho’s (1999) experience-weighted attraction (EWA) model. Other learn -
ing models include anticipatory learning models, which assume sophistication, imitative learning, learning direction theory and rule-based learning. The most influential of these approaches are outlined below. In addition, there are social learning models which have some parallels in sociology and social psychology as we will explore in Chapter 6 on sociality and identity.
Belief learning
In belief learning (BL) models, attractions are built by attaching probabilities to each strat -
egy combination from other players giving a time-dependent belief function in which beliefs about others’ actions are updated as history unfolds. Players track the relative fre -
quency of other players’ strategies and these relative frequencies generate beliefs about other players’ actions in the next period. This information is used to calculate expected payoffs given these beliefs.
Variants of BL models emerge depending on the weights attached to past actions. 
Brown (1951) develops a fictitious play (FP) model incorporating a more “appealing” assumption that players respond to the average of the observed history with previous ob -
servations counted and weighted equally. In Cournot models, following Cournot (1838) players choose the best response to opponents’ most recently observed action; only the opponent’s last action is counted.
Boylan and El-Gamal (1993) found in lab sessions that sometimes the Cournot model 
outperforms the FP model but at other times FP outperforms Cournot. To provide further comparative tests of belief learning models, Cheung and Friedman (1997) put together experimental evidence to show that equilibrium predictions lack predictive power and for most studies one of the players moved away from equilibrium initially.
a belief learning model
Assuming that beliefs are not directly observable, Cheung and Friedman construct their empirical learning rules based on a schema in which players and institutions/mechanisms generate interactions and feedbacks between actions, outcomes and beliefs. Actions in -
teract with payoff functions to generate outcome; outcomes interact with learning rules to generate beliefs. Beliefs interact with decision rules to generate actions; and then the process starts again. They construct a 3-parameter learning model to capture these differ -
ent BL approaches by postulating a set of beliefs and jointly estimate the decision rule and learning rule. They use the Cournot rule to capture current beliefs based on most recently observed actions, and an FP rule in which current beliefs based on simple averages of all previously observed states of the world. Past states are discounted with declining weights depending on how far back in time these states were, with the impact of past states cap -
tured by a learning parameter. The mathematical details of this approach are outlined in Mathematical Appendix A5.1.76 lEarn In g
A behavioural explanation can be assigned to the relative magnitude of the weights: 
when past observations are assigned no weight, as in the Cournot rule, then this cap -
tures recency effects which occur when recent and easily remembered information has 
a disproportionate impact on beliefs – possibly the outcome of applying the availability heuristic, as discussed in Chapter 3 . If older observations are given a greater weight than 
more recent observations, then this suggests that first impressions have a disproportion -
ate impact and this might reflect the application of anchoring and adjustment heuristics, also discussed in Chapter 3 . It seems unlikely that past states would be assigned negative 
weights but if they are then the rule would be unstable.
The BL rule gives a decision rule based on the probability that a player will choose a 
given action; this will be determined by three elements. First, a player’s responsiveness to the relative payoff from an action – the evidence weight; second, a player’s idiosyncratic preference for that action; and third, the learning parameter. Cheung and Friedman apply their learning rules to the study of choices in experimental games.
Cheung and Friedman’s experiments
In their controlled laboratory experiments, Cheung and Friedman used computerized experiments based on five groups of game: Hawk-Dove, Coordination (Stag Hunt), Pris -
oner’s Dilemma, Buyer-Seller and Battle of the Sexes. (For those unfamiliar with the struc -
ture of these games, refer to an introductory game theory text, e.g. Dixit and Skeath 2004.) Players were matched in two ways: mean matching in which each player was matched once against each possible opponent; and random matching. Cheung and Friedman also incorporate two variants of historical data conditions: the “history” condition in which players are given information about states in previous periods; and the “no history” con -
dition in which no historical information is given.
Using Probit techniques, they estimate the probability of a given action using relative 
payoffs, idiosyncratic preferences and past states of the world as explanatory variables. In some experiments, they found that play was consistent with mixed strategy Nash equi -
librium and rational play. For coordination games, they find that parameters on all three explanatory variables are significantly different from zero, with a learning parameter estimated to be between 0 and 1, supporting adaptive belief learning over Cournot or FP. Overall, the findings from coordination games are broadly similar findings from the analysis of Buyer-Seller and Battle of the Sexes games too.
The implication that Cheung and Friedman draw from their analysis is that players 
are heterogeneous. Estimates of the parameters enable classification of players into types: Cournot players with short memories; intermediate players with adaptive BL; and long memory players using FP rules. They find that the distribution of player type is invariant to payoff but the learning parameter decreases in more informative environments and the evidence weight parameter is positive for most players. Most data are also consistent with the more sophisticated model of anticipatory learning  in which players use information about 
others’ payoffs not just the frequency of their choices.
Overall, Cheung and Friedman conclude that, together, their findings support belief 
learning models over reinforcement learning models. The support for this assertion is mixed however, and some economists have found similarly robust support for reinforce -
ment learning models, as discussed in the following section. 77 rEI nForCEM Ent  lEar nIng
reinforcement learning
Insights from economic models of reinforcement learning parallel developments in 
behavioural psychology. The personality theories of Sigmund Freud and the psycho -
analysts were controversial and the behavioural psychologists rejected Freudian ap -
proaches to understanding what underlies behaviour as subjective and speculative. Instead, they focused instead on analyzing objective facts viz. observed choices and the direct and indirect impacts of stimuli upon these choices. This focus on observed behaviour fits neatly with the experimental and game theory themes seen in mod -
ern behavioural economics which are about analysing choices. Behavioural psychology developed from Nobel prize-winning physiologist – Ivan Pavlov (1849–1946). Pavlov pioneered the study of classical conditioning. He was studying the digestive systems of dogs and noticed that they often started salivating before they tasted food; salivation was an unconditioned response to the unconditioned stimulus of receiving food. Pavlov hypothesized that a conditioned stimulus could induce a conditioned response and so set metronomes running a few seconds before feeding meat powder to his dogs. He found that once the dogs had learned the connection between the metronome and the food they would start salivating on hearing the metronome and before receiving the meat powder. Salivation was a learned, conditioned response and Pavlov found that the salivation response could be conditioned on a range of stimuli including rotating 
disks and lights (Pavlov 1904/67).
Watson and Rayner (1920) generalized Pavlov’s findings about conditioned responses 
to humans and conducted a famously unethical study of Albert B to establish that phobias were the outcome of conditioning not early sexual conflicts, as asserted by the Freudians. Albert B was approximately 9 months old when the study commenced:
the infant was confronted suddenly and for the first time successively with a white 
rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, with masks with and without hair, cotton wool, burning newspapers, etc. … No one had ever seen him in a state of fear and rage. The infant practically never cried.
When Albert B reached 11 months, Watson and Rayner decided to see if they could condi -
tion a fear response by banging a bar behind Albert’s head to make an unexpectedly loud 
and frightening sound. Their lab notes read:
White rat suddenly taken from the basket and presented to Albert. He began to reach 
for rat with left hand. Just as his hand touched the animal the bar was struck imme -
diately behind his head. The infant jumped violently and fell forward, burying his face in the mattress. He did not cry, however. Just as the right hand touched the rat the bar was again struck … Again the infant jumped violently, fell forward and began to whimper.
After an interval they again struck the bar whilst presenting the rat to Albert.
The instant the rat was shown the baby began to cry. Almost instantly he turned sharply to the left, fell over on left side, raised himself on all fours and began to crawl away so rapidly that he was caught with difficulty before reaching the edge of the table.78 lEarn In g
They also found that the conditioned fear response endured over time and was general -
ized to other similar objects: to a great or lesser extent the fear response could also be 
elicited when a toy rabbit, toy dog, Santa Claus mask and cotton wool were produced.
Edward L. Thorndike’s theory of learning developed these concepts of conditioning to 
focus on operant conditioning (that is conditioning based on the performance of specific ac -
tions) and the laws of effect, exercise and recency (Thorndike 1911). Thorndike’s laws underlie 
models of learning in economics and are based on studies of animal behaviour. Thorndike’s experiments included a study of 13 young cats, aged between 4 and 19 months. The cats were confined in small boxes secured via various combinations of loops, levers, bars, boards and bolts. The cats initially followed their instincts and impulses in trying to escape – Thorndike defines an instinct carefully as “any reaction an animal makes to a situation without experi -
ence” (p. 21) and impulse is “the consciousness accompanying a muscular innervation … the direct feeling of doing. [For example] hunger is the impulse which makes the cat claw … by impulse I never mean the motive to the act” (p. 22). Thorndike found that 11 of 13 cats soon learned to escape the boxes first via a process of trial and error until:
all the other non-successful impulses will be stamped out and the particular impulse 
leading to the successful act will be stamped in by the resulting pleasure, until, after many trials, the cat will, when put in the box, immediately claw the button or loop in a definite way.
 (Thorndike 1911, p. 21).
From this, Thorndike constructed laws about how learning progresses by making asso -
ciations between stimuli, actions and rewards: the law of effect is that the actions which 
produce pleasure give positive reinforcement and will be repeated – learning will build on pleasure and reward; the law of exercise is that the more often a positive (negative) association is made, the more (less) likely it is to be used and vice versa; and the law of re-cency is that recent events will be more salient and so recent responses are more likely to be repeated but impacts of prior rewards and punishments will decay over time. Insights from Thorndike’s analyses are adopted in economic models of reinforcement learning and neuroeconomic theories of reward learning, both explored in Chapter 4. The law of exercise also has implications for models of habits, as explored in Chapter 9.
B.F. Skinner used Thorndike’s analysis of operant conditioning/instrumental learning 
to inform extensive experimental studies of animal learning and focused his analysis purely on observable choices and, via rewards and punishments, using the environment to manipulate choices. He fostered an extreme version of behavioural 
 ps
ychology  –  ra
dical 
behaviourism, which confines itself to studying inputs and behavioural outcomes. Whilst experimenters might manipulate the conditions under which choices are made to see how behaviour is affected, the focus is on observables: the inputs and outcomes in terms of behaviour, not the unseen underlying processes driving it (Skinner 1974). In extreme behaviourism, personality traits and individual differences are not the focus of analysis and, much as early neoclassical theorists treated the firm as a black box, focusing on ob -
servable inputs and outputs to production, similarly in radical behaviourism choices are made in a black box – information and stimuli go in, choices come out and the experi -
menter concentrates just on observed behaviour rather than the processes underlying it.
These insights about stimuli and reinforcement in conditioning, consistent with Skin -
ner’s radical behaviourism , underpin economic models of reinforcement learning. A lot of  79 rEI nForCEM Ent  lEar nIng
the work on conditioning in experimental psychology, including Skinner’s experiments, 
concentrated on experimental testing of animal models. Harper (1982) studied mallard ducks foraging for food. Mallards live in small groups and obtain food by foraging. They have extremely small brains but still were able to exhibit rational behaviour consistent with predictions from game theory. The experiments were conducted in Cambridge Uni -
versity botanical gardens in 1979, with a flock of 33 mallards. Two experimenters threw bread balls: experimenter 1 throwing 2-gram bread balls every 5 seconds, the other every 10 seconds, giving a 33-duck Nash-type game assuming linear approximation of utility for range of bread ball sizes. The mallards quickly learnt to identify the mixed strategy equilibrium (of 2/3 of ducks in front of experimenter 1, and 1/3 in front of experimenter 2), though some argue that this equilibrium is also consistent with less objective factors, such as pecking order, conflict, and so on.
RL models also take from behavioural psychology the focus on observed behaviours, 
for example in an experimental context, rather than on underlying drivers of those be -
haviours. It links to the behavioural psychology concept of Pavlovian learning. The focus is on the law of effect : all behaviour is a learned response to previous reinforcement so RL is 
about conditioning. We learn to do something because of the rewards it delivers, or not to do it because of the costs it imposes. In RL models, the time-dependent value function is a weighted average of past payoffs and past attractions. RL attractions build up either via cumulative processes or as weighted averages, with probabilities of choosing a given strat -
egy determined by past reinforcements. This impact from past reinforcement does gen -
erate anchoring on previous strategies because choices are reinforced by previous payoffs but there may also be spillovers to similar strategies. Nonetheless, a RL model will imply that behaviour exhibits some inertia, changing slowly, similar to adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory. This insight is also incorporated into neuroeconomics in Schultz (2002) and Schultz et al. ’s (1997) models of reward prediction error, as discussed in more 
depth in the neuroeconomics chapters – Chapters 11 and 12.
a reinforcement learning model
One advantage of RL models is that they imply a relatively simple form of learning that is easy to understand and model. It captures reasoning when players have no knowledge about payoffs from strategies they have not chosen and so strategies not chosen will be hard to quantify. Erev and Roth (1998) have conducted some influential analyses of RL applied to ultimatum games (UGs) and public good games (PGGs). These games are ex -
plored in more detail in the sociality chapter (Chapter 6 ) but essentially the ultimatum 
game is a game in which Player A offers Player B some share of a sum of money; if Player B refuses the offer then both players get nothing. The public goods game involves players making individual contributions to financing a hypothetical public good; if the combined contributions are insufficient then the public good is not provided.
Erev and Roth’s experimental evidence shows that people converge onto uneven di -
visions in market games and PGGs but converge to nearly equal offers in UGs and whilst this result might seem anomalous if explained in a non-learning context, Erev and Roth claim that RL can explain this apparent anomaly.
Erev and Roth (1998) examine learning in experiments with 100 periods or more of 
games, with unique equilibrium in mixed strategies. They assess ex ante  and ex post  predic -
tive power by simulating each experiment using parameters from the other experiments. 80 lEarn In g
They develop their model from the insight that traditional game theory assumes perfect 
rationality and equilibrium but construct a more general model that captures learning in different types of games. They link this general model into a cognitive version of game theory, which blends economics and psychology with “forgetting” and “experimenta -
tion” incorporated to improve predictive power.
Erev and Roth start by assuming that initially players have equal propensities to play 
all strategies. However, over time particular strategies are differentially reinforced and so players update their learning attractions accordingly, as captured by an updating function. People are assumed to follow probabilistic choice rule: probabilities that pure strategies are played reflect the relative propensity to play the strategy. The updating function can be generalized to capture reinforcement from similar strategies and can also be adapted to incorporate adjustable reference points to address the insight from Kahneman and Tver -
sky’s (1979) prospect theory that choices reflect changes not levels of utility, as noted in the previous chapter. The mathematics of Erev and Roth’s RL model is outlined in Math -
ematical Appendix A5.2.
The impact of experience varies. It can lead to quick convergence, have little impact 
or lead to initial divergences away from equilibrium. In essence, RL models have a strong link with behavioural psychology and they capture Thorndike’s law of effect – outcomes in the past are more likely to be repeated in the future. Choice behaviour is probabilistic and learning follows a power law of practice: learning curves are steep initially, but they flatten as experience accumulates.
Erev and rot h’s empirical evidence
Erev and Roth use an innovative approach to the data and empirical methodology. They study repeated matrix games with unique mixed strategy equilibria, each of which involves at least 100 rounds of play but their analysis is not focused entirely on their own data. They use data from 11 other studies (including nine studies of zero sum games) conducted by other experimenters from 1960s to 1990s. This methodology is used to escape the “tooth -
brush” approach: experimenters use their methods like toothbrushes, that is, they favour their own. This creates a problem because if they only use their own experiments then they may unconsciously adapt their experimental designs to fit the model that they’ve con -
structed. Using others’ datasets forces them to “tie their hands” to escape this trap.
Their hypotheses are constructed around three main types of model: a 1-
 par
ameter 
“basic reinforcement” model; a 3-parameter model incorporating additional parame -
ters for “experimentation” and “forgetting” and a 4-parameter “fictitious play (FP)-like” model which adds initial beliefs, assumed to be frequency of others’ actions. These models are used in computer simulations of each experiment, predicting the probability of each action at each period and the predictions of 1-parameter, 3-parameter and 4-
 par
ameter 
models are compared using a mean-squared deviation (MSD) criterion. For the 3-param -
eter RE model, they add two psychological assumptions: an experimentation effect and a recency effect/forgetting.
In the FP-like model, responsiveness to others’ actions is incorporated explicitly in 
the form of excepted value calculations to capture beliefs. The model also incorporates a “habit” parameter; the number of times a strategy played in the past influences the prob -
ability that it’ll be played in the future. This is captured using an average return variable incorporating the expected value of a strategy. 81 EXPE rIEnCE-WEI gHtED at tra CtIon  (EW a)
Erev and Roth’s (1998) empirical findings are that the 1-parameter basic reinforcement 
model outperforms equilibrium predictions but fails to account for late movements towards 
equilibrium. Their analysis suggests less responsiveness to opponents than is observed in most experiments. For the 3-parameter RE model, it outperforms the basic models, im -
proves on the 1-parameter reinforcement model and has the lowest MSD of all models tested. For the 4-parameter FP-like model, there is no significant decrease in MSD relative to the RE model though the habit parameter contributes to the model’s descriptive  power.
Erev and Roth (1998) conclude that learning is an important omission from standard 
models. There are three relevant learning processes: encoding past events, converting knowledge into production rules and strengthening production rules. Agents pick opti -
mal strategies and stick to them, reflecting Thorndike’s law of effect seen in cats, pigeons and other animal experiments. Thorndike’s laws, as explored above, incorporate rein -
forcement but deeper processes are relevant too. Capturing these different influences can enable the consilience of game theory and cognitive psychology to give a low-rationality version of game theory. This could better explain real-world phenomena, for example academic job markets in which employers gradually learn to advertise earlier in response to early deadlines amongst competing institutions.
Overall, Erev and Roth advocate the development of a “cognitive game theory” which 
combines the insights about learning from economics and psychology. They suggest de -
veloping John Anderson’s ACT* theory which distinguishes production rules (strategies such as minimax, tit-for-tat are production rules) from learning. A cognitive game theory would retain a strategic approach whilst allowing bounds to rationality. These could in -
clude games in which players fail to consider all possible strategies, do not allow maxi -
mizers and/or do not allow an explicit role for preferences.
Experience-weighted attraction (EW a)
Theoretically, RL incorporates an assumption that information about forgone payoffs is ig -
nored and BL assumes that players ignore information about past strategies. Empirically, Che -
ung and Friedman’s (1997) evidence supports BL and Erev and Roth’s (1998) evidence supports RL. A hybrid model that reconciles the two models should have superior explanatory power. Camerer and Ho (1999) provide a solution in the form of the hybrid 
 ex
perience-weighted at -
traction (EWA) model that captures updating of values in the  be
lief-based model to generate 
a time-dependent value function that “nests” RL and BL, filling the gaps and limitations of both approaches. EWA is a backward-looking model of adaptive learning based on past ex -
perience either in the form of direct reinforcement or as evidence about the history of other players’ strategies. EWA combines RL and weighted fictitious play (WFP) models in which past actions of other players are assigned declining weight over time, and thereby provides an encompassing model with RL and BL as boundary cases.
Thorndike’s law of effect asserts that successful strategies will be repeated because 
past experiences are reinforced. EWA models allow for this and also incorporate a “law of simulated effect” capturing the fact that strategies that would have been successful are also repeated more often (Camerer 2003b, p. 305). The weighting from applying the law of simulated effect also has psychological interpretations. It may represent opportunity costs, counterfactuals and regret. It may be affected by imagination and/or reliability of information. By combining the traditional law of effect with the law of simulated effect, EWA models nest BL and RL models in the form of weighted fictitious play.82 lEarn In g
Experimental evidence about EW a mo dels
Camerer (2003) sets out some empirical evidence in support of EWA stating that in studies 
of about 31 data sets, EWA fits/predicts out of sample more accurately than RL or WFP except in games with mixed strategy equilibria. He examines specifically the evidence from two types of games: continental divide games and beauty contests.
Continental divide games
The continental divide game captures conformity to others’ strategies. For example, new media firms will locate where there are strong linkages with other local industries. A choice between Silicon Valley and Hollywood will generate an economic tug-of-war won by doing what most other firms are doing. This hypothesis is captured empirically using a simple experiment in which seven players each choose an integer from 1 to 14. The best response is to choose a low number when others choose low and high number when others choose high. If unsure, it is best to pick a number with the largest range of payoffs. Camerer (2003) concludes that the experimental data from continental divide games fits better with EWA models than alternatives because EWA captures the interaction of beliefs about what other firms are doing and reinforcement from the payoff externalities which emerge when a large number of firms do the same thing, for example all firms will ben -
efit from other firms’ investments in local infrastructure.
Beauty contests
In addition to the evidence from continental divide games, Camerer (2003) also relies on evidence from beauty contests to support EWA models. Beauty contest games are inspired by Keynes’s (1936) insights. Foreshadowing the beauty contests developed by modern behavioural economists, Keynes uses a metaphor of a newspaper beauty contest. Compet -
itors are not asked to pick the “prettiest faces” but “those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors”. In beauty contests, speculators in financial markets reach a “third degree” of reasoning. They do not form beliefs about fundamental, true values or payoffs but instead are trying to guess what others think and they are trying to second-guess average opinion of average opinion:
It is not the case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgement, are really the 
prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what aver -
age opinion expects average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.
(Keynes 1936, p. 156)
Keynes postulates that financial speculators are engaged in this form of strategic thinking: 
they are preoccupied with forecasting average opinion of average opinion rather than with their own objective judgements about the value of an asset and this contributes to financial instability, as explored in Part II.
Using Keynes’s beauty contest metaphor as a starting point, Nagel (1995) designed a 
form of beauty contest game – the “ p beauty contest” , to capture levels of reasoning with 
a prize going to player(s) who select a strategy closest to some product p of the average  83 EXPE rIEnCE-WEI gHtED at tra CtIon  (EW a)
strategy. For a set of strategy choices including 1 to 100 in a game played a finite num -
ber of times, then if play is random, a naïve player might expect an average guess of 50 
from the others and so will guess p×50 but more sophisticated players will realize that 
they cannot assume that other players’ actions will be random. Sophisticated players will adopt strategic reasoning to make inferences about the strategic choices of other players because they realize that other players also know the rules of the game. Assuming com -
plete rationality, the game is dominance solvable with inferior strategies eliminated via a process of backward induction. For example, with 
p=23, in Round 1 players will realize 
that choices greater than 2/3 × 100 are bound to lose because they are strictly dominated and so 68 to 100 will be eliminated leaving 1 to 67 and players will take the average of this, that is, an average of 
×× = 1223100 33. 5. In Round 2, players will predict that 
others make the same judgement and so guess that others would not select average of 
()××× = 122323100 22 and so on.
A player is strategic of degree n if he/she selects a number 50pn, which approaches 
zero as n approaches infinity, assuming p <1. With “deep” reasoning this process will con -
tinue a large number of times until a Nash equilibrium strategy of 0 is reached. Real-life evidence from experimental beauty contests suggests however that people do not think the problem through thoroughly. In lab experiments, most people use only 2–4 levels of iterated reasoning and the iterative process is driven by naïve best replies rather than by elimination of dominated strategies. This is a robust finding and studies from Nagel, Thaler and others show that a range of players, from FT readers to business CEOs, show limited depths of reasoning (Camerer 2003). For Keynes’s speculators, in modern lan -
guage: if traders don’t backward induct (and this may be for strategic reasons) they will not immediately sell perhaps because they don’t expect others to sell. This reluctance to sell on the basis of predicting others’ actions will generate persistent speculative bubbles.
The length of the game in terms of the number of iterations can be explained in a 
range of ways. It may reflect limits on cognitive ability and working memory. It may also reflect strategic motivations and assumptions about others’ rationality: if you are a strategic thinker then you will not choose 0 because you might anticipate that others would not reason that far. Selecting 0 assumes too much about others’ reasoning capacity/motivation.
In the context of learning, beauty contests are interesting because simple learning 
does takes place. Ho, Camerer and Weigelt (1998) conducted the first replication of the Nagel study using different values of p to assess the impact of learning. In initial rounds, players showed one to three steps of iterated reasoning but there was transfer of learning from one game to the other, evidence that the players were learning to learn. They con -
verged more rapidly and showed greater depth of reasoning the more times they played the games.
Camerer (2003) describes p -beauty contests designed specifically to test EWA learn -
ing models. In these experiments, each player picks a number from the interval [0,100]. The player closest to a target number wins where the target is p multiplied by the average 
guess. By iterated deletion, if 
p=23, then numbers in range [67,100] cannot win and so 
are deleted. Then ×=2367 44 so numbers in range [45,67] are deleted. Iterated reasoning 
proceeds deleting ×=2344 29 and then ×=232920, and so on until, assuming strong 
rationality, the Nash  equilibrium of 0 is reached, as in the Nagel experiments.
Camerer (2003) shows that both BL and EWA perform well in explaining beauty 
contest play. RL neither fits nor predicts because six of seven players each period are not 84 lEarn In g
earning or learning anything because the opportunities for reinforcement in the beauty 
contest game are very limited. If players are learning about others’ beliefs, they must be forming beliefs about those beliefs and so it follows that RL models cannot explain the findings.
The results can also capture the phenomenon of sophisticated players realizing that 
others are learning, and these ideas are captured in models of anticipatory/sophisticated learning too. In these models, players use information about others’ payoffs to reason thoughtfully about what the other player might do. They form beliefs based on best re -
sponse functions (BRFs) where the BRFs include some information about others’ payoffs.
Comparative econometric evidence  
on EW a v
ersus rl a
nd B l mo
dels
There has been some econometric testing of learning theory; for example, Salmon (2001) 
assesses the empirical evidence on learning models and concludes that it is disappointing, partly because early econometric analyses were conducted when our knowledge of the statistical properties of estimators were not so well understood. Salmon’s econometric evaluation of learning models involves simulating RL, BL and EWA models and whilst model identification is generally poor, the EWA models perform relatively well allowing a sharp distinction of RL and BL models.
Overall, both RL and BL have empirical support with hybrid/encompassing models 
and EWA models capturing elements of both. It is difficult to separate the explanations econometrically, partly because data on observed actions do not reveal the underlying cognitive processes that enable learning. Neuroeconomic analyses may be able to capture something of what’s going on behind revealed preferences and open the “black box” that underlies decision-making (Camerer et al . 2005).
In comparing the various models of learning, Camerer argues that they can also be 
compared according to the legitimacy of the underlying informational assumptions, that is, judging the plausibility of learning theories rests on the sort of information that is required. If people use information that’s not captured in the theory then the theory is incomplete; if the theory demands more information than people are feasibly able to use, for example as seen in rational expectations assumptions, then the theory is too com -
plex (Camerer 2003a,b). Information use depends not only on information available but also on cognitive capacities. Camerer (2006) explains the different levels of information needed in the different theories and the information needed ranges from the player’s choice, their opponent’s choice, received and forgone payoffs for players and opponents, and best response.
The different learning theories vary considerably in terms of their assumptions about 
minimal information needed, with evolutionary theory having the minimal information assumptions because if everything is instinctive then no information is needed. Some of 
the informational implications can be used to compare and contrast learning theories. People learn faster when they have full payoff information and this contradicts RL. Also, the fact that people look up information about their own previous payoffs is inconsistent with BL theory. That people behave differently when they have information about others’ payoffs support s theories based on more sophisticated learning processes and also sup -
ports theories incorporating imitative learning. 85 HErDIng an D SoCIal  lEar nIng
Herding and social learning
Behavioural economics also explores a specific type of learning in the form of social 
learning, associated with the phenomenon (see Baddeley (2018) for a survey of insights from economics and other subjects). Herding is a general category of behaviours in which people follow groups of others and may do so for all sorts of reasons. It is the phenome -
non of individuals deciding to follow others and imitating group behaviours rather than deciding independently and atomistically on the basis of their own, private information.
One of the pioneering studies of herding and social learning is the information cas -
cade model developed by Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch (BHW; 1992, 1998). They focus on social learning in the context of uniform social behaviour. They identify four primary herding mechanisms encouraging people to do what others do: sanctions on deviants, positive payoff externalities, conformity preference and communication. Bikh -
chandani et al. observe however that these social influences cannot fully explain fragility 
of mass behaviour and changes in attitudes, for example as we see in changing attitudes towards common phenomena such as cohabitation, sexuality, communism and addiction. So BHW propose that social learning in the form of “information cascades” also gener -
ates uniform social behaviour. An information cascade occurs “when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behaviour of the preceding individual without regard to his own information” (BHW 1992, p. 994).
BHW enumerate many examples of phenomena explicable as information cascades 
including political campaigning – for example US presidential nomination campaigns; foraging and mating behaviour (see also Danchin et al.  2004); medical practice, includ -
ing surgical fads and “iatroepidemics”, that is, epidemics of treatment-caused diseases; competing bids during corporate takeovers; and peer influence/social stigma in labour markets when the long-term unemployed are discriminated against in hiring decisions.
To complement BHW’s analyses, the other seminal economic model of herding and 
social learning is Banerjee’s (1992). Banerjee notes that people are heavily influenced by what others are doing, for example in fertility choices, technology adoption and voting patterns and this is because we learn from the herd: it is rational to pay heed to what others are doing because they may have better information. This generates inefficient outcomes because when information cascades are generated, private information becomes uninformative and a herding externality is created. Banerjee uses the example of restau -
rant choice. There are two restaurants A and B: Restaurant A is favoured a priori by 51%; Restaurant B is favoured a priori by 49%. Then 100 people make sequential decisions about which restaurant to choose. If 99 out of 100 people have private signals indicating that Restaurant B is better, then aggregate evidence suggests that Restaurant B should be preferred on average. This does not mean that it will be preferred in practice.
Imagine that Alice is the first person to choose but she has a misleading private signal, 
for example a newspaper review written by a biased restaurant critic, favouring Restau -
rant A. If Bob chooses next, then he must balance three pieces of information: the a priori  
probability which favours restaurant A; his correct private signal which favours Restaurant B and the social information, that is, Alice’s observed choice. If he uses Bayesian reasoning then he will weight the first and second pieces of information equally, these conflicting signals will cancel out and he will rationally choose Restaurant A essentially because Alice did, even though, all things considered, it is not the best restaurant.86 lEarn In g
An information cascade is generated because the third person to choose – Chris, will 
choose Restaurant A because the misleading information conveyed by Alice and Bob’s 
choices have overwhelmed Chris’s private information generating herding towards a res -
taurant which, all information considered, is less preferable. From that point onwards, assuming that all subsequent decision-makers apply Bayes’s rule, then all private informa -
tion becomes uninformative. Information is used inefficiently because all private signals are ignored even though they contain information that would be useful and relevant for decision-makers as a whole.
The implication is that private information has no influence on choices of the herd. 
Banerjee refers to this negative consequence in which relevant private information is ig -
nored as a herding externality. Bikhanchandi, Hirshleifer and Welch (1992) develop a sim -
ilar model of informational cascades as an explanation for localized conformity emerging when it is optimal for an individual to follow the actions of his/her predecessor and to dis -
regard his private information. Just as is seen in Banerjee’s model, each sequential decision conveys no real new evidence to subsequent members of the herd and so private informa -
tion becomes uninformative. To summarize: according to Bayesian theories, herding and informational cascades emerge because members of the herd are ignoring their own pri -
vate signals to favour herd information about the actions of their predecessors. This means that they will potentially be ignoring a large volume of important private information.
If the herd path fosters increasing noise within the system, then the process of opin -
ion formation will become unstable. Further research is needed to assess the extent to which herds move in either stable or unstable directions. This can be done by assess -
ing the extent to which herd leaders (experts) are selected on objective versus subjective grounds, and by assessing the extent to which herd leaders turn out to be right in the end. This would be another direction for fruitful and useful future research.
Herding phenomena are consistent with different statistical hypotheses, for example 
Kirman (1993), using a Markov chain approach develops the “ants” model in which ants “convert” by copying another ant. For example, ants faced with two symmetric food sources will tend to concentrate on one or the other source rather than distributing them -
selves evenly across both. This behaviour pattern may be interpreted as recruitment ac -
tivity by ants. With positive externalities from foraging behavior, the joint exploitation of one source will give more benefit to the group than an even distribution of effort over two different sources (Kirman 1993).
Overall, models of herding and social learning based on Bayesian updating models 
assume that agents are using sophisticated logical methods but the outcome can be good or bad depending on whether the decision-makers are sent down a correct or incorrect track by the actions of their predecessors.
Experimental tests of Bayesian herding
Anderson and Holt (1996, 1997) construct an illustration of how this reasoning process works and test the hypotheses experimentally using an urn experiment. Imagine that you, along with a group of other experimental subjects, are asked to participate in an exper -
iment. You are told that there are two urns: Urn A and Urn B; Urn A contains two red balls and one black ball; and Urn B contains one red ball and two black balls, as shown in Figure 5.1 87 HErDIng an D SoCIal  lEar nIng
Then you are asked to draw a ball from an unmarked urn and guess which urn is 
being used. The experimenter has concealed the urn’s label so it could be Urn A, it could 
be Urn B. All things being equal, if you draw a red ball, then that is more likely if Urn A is being used and less likely if Urn B is being used. But your choice is complicated by the fact that you see other people making guesses too. Other subjects are taking a ball from the unmarked urn, concealing its colour from the group, replacing it in the urn and an -
nouncing their guess. According to Anderson and Holt, people judge the probability that Urn A is being used according to the choices of their predecessors, with a choice made 
sequentially by each subject in turn based on the application of Bayes’s rule. In the first round for example, if the first person to choose guesses Urn A, then that is a signal that it was a red ball, because red balls are more likely in Urn A.
Anderson and Holt explain how a rational person would judge the probability that 
Urn A is being used if the choices are made sequentially with each experimental subject observing the others’ decisions one by one, inferring the colour of the ball from their choices, and applying Bayes’s rule accordingly updating  probabilities as new social in -
formation comes along. If a person sees their predecessor picking Urn B, then they will update their probabilities to make the probability of Urn B more likely. An arithmetic analysis of Bayes’s rule is summarized in Mathematical Appendix A5.3.

For example: if Alice announces that she thinks the ball comes from Urn A then 
the others would assume that she picked a red ball. Then Bob chooses. Perhaps he 
chooses a black ball but he infers that Alice drew a red ball and from this concludes that the probability that the ball comes from Urn A is 50%. He could rationally choose either urn but imagine that he guesses Urn A. Then Chris chooses and perhaps he also chooses a black ball but he assumes that both Alice and Bob had picked red balls and so, if he is using Bayes’s rule, then he infers that Urn A has been chosen because red balls have been picked twice, against his single draw of a black ball. Overall, he judges that the probability of Urn A is 67% so he will also choose Urn A even though he picked a black ball. From that point onwards, if people are using Bayes’s rule then the posterior probabilities of Urn A are ever increasing so the herd is led down the route of choos -
ing Urn A and each individual will effectively ignore their private signal and private information is lost.
Anderson and Holt (1996, 1997) use this urn experiment to test the Bayesian 
herding as social learning hypothesis. In one set of experiments, 72 undergradu -
ate economics students were paid fixed cash payments for correct decisions. One was selected as monitor to choose an urn and pour contents into an unmarked urn. Then the subjects were chosen in random order to draw a ball one by one and an -
nounce their prediction to the group. Each drew a ball, which represented their pri -
vate 
 si
gnal; the others weren’t allowed to see which ball they drew. The subjects 
announced their decision and this was a signal to the others about whether Urn A or Urn B had been used. Anderson and Holt observed information cascades in 41 of 56 periods in which there was an imbalance between private signal and previous inferred signal. They 
 ca
lculated the “efficiency” of decisions as the percentage of 
decisions consistent with the optimal expected payoff if Bayes’s rule had been used and found that 2/3 of subjects made decisions with 100% efficiency, that is, in perfect conformity with Bayes’s rule. Similar results have been found in a large number of studies of Bayesian social learning hypotheses. More recently, Fishman and Gneezy (2011) have tested the hypothesis using Banerjee’s example of restaurant choice and found  that, in 
 sit
uations  of limited  information/experience, restaurant queues were 
longer,  which  would  be  co
nsistent with people deciding that longer queues signalled 
quality.
The outcome predicted by the Bayesian social learning hypothesis is not infal -
lible for a number of reasons. Bob’s decision was on a knife edge – he could have, legitimately and correctly, applied Bayes’s Law to choose Urn B and send the herd in the right direction. Alternatively, people may apply a form of iterative thinking. They realize that they could make a choice that matches what their predecessors have done but that it conflicts with their own private signal, so they will also realize that others may be doing the same. They will realize that the others are choosing an Urn just on the basis of predecessors’ choices, not because they have actually picked a red ball, for example Chris may not infer that Bob picked a red ball just because he chose Urn A and so Chris may apply a corrective factor to allow for his degree of uncertainty about why Bob chose Urn A.
Anderson and Holt’s laboratory experiments generally focus on a discrete signal/action 
model. More recently, Çelen and Kariv (2004), amongst others, have used experimental  89 HErDIng an D SoCIal  lEar nIng
evidence to distinguish between herding as a broad descriptive category of copying be -
haviours and informational cascades as a specific form of learning that arises in uncertain 
situations.
Empirically, herding as a Bayesian learning process is consistent with evidence from 
a large number of economic experiments including Anderson and Holt (1996, 1997) and many others. This evidence does not establish that a Bayesian explanation is superior to other explanations including those drawing upon ideas from other social sciences. Nonetheless, even in the Bayesian models, the basic premise is that economic decisions are in essence the outcome of a cognitive process employing a mathematical algorithm to process information and form expectations. In addition, the focus tends to be on a dichotomous division of behaviour into rational or irrational; a person is assumed to be rational if their behaviour is consistent with Bayesian updating. Sociological influences are confined to learning from others’ actions and psychological and emotional factors are accorded very little role at all.
Learning themes emerge in the macroeconomic literature too. Herding theory has its 
roots in Keynes who focused on motivations to imitate and follow the crowd in a world of uncertainty and this may happen for a range of reasons (Keynes 1930, 1936). Topol (1991) analyses herding as the outcome of rational trading in which traders weight information about prices paid by other traders against private judgements of fundamental value. Ace -
moglu (1993) analyses rational learning about others’ decisions via signal extraction from aggregate data. In Part III, we will explore some of these macroeconomic insights around herding in more depth.
Ideas about imitative learning are also developed in analyses from Austrian 
economics which explore Hayek’s insights about knowledge as a path-dependent process (Hayek, 1952; Rizzello 2004). Paralleling the sequential herding theories of Bayesian theorists, social learning in Austrian economics differs from ordinary problem-
 so
lving in that serial processing of information is important, generating 
path dependency  and propelling the acquisition of knowledge along a path deter -
mined by past beliefs.
A significant behavioural constraint occurs if people do not have the numeracy 
to be able to think in the sophisticated way assumed in models of Bayesian learn -
ing. Anderson (1998) argues that this is a consequence of the nature of memes, the cultural analogy of genes. The problem originates in the input format of data, and in algorithms used but if prompted by clear signals, the human brain is able to deal with probabilities effectively. For example,  as we saw in the previous chapter, if stu -
dents are asked to judge the probability of two coincident events within the context of a statistics class, then they will know what to do. However, if outside their classes they are confronted with a problem requiring probability judgements in a situation in which it is not obvious that this is what is required, then they may make an in -
stinctive, intuitive judgement which may generate statistical mistakes (Kyburg 1997). Anderson suggests that Bayesian approaches could be refined using the advantages of a frequentist approach by using mental, visual imagery and graphic display. In this way, some frequentist methods could be incorporated effectively into a Bayes -

Evolutionary approaches to learning
The models of herding outlined above connect closely with literatures in economic the-
ory and are not inconsistent with economists’ usual focus on rational choice, though the concepts of rationality embedded in the above herding models are softened to allow Bayesian rationality rather than optimizing behaviour. Herding as a phenomenon is also explored across the range of social and behavioural sciences, and evolution is a theme that connects these large and diverse literatures (Baddeley 2018).
Evolutionary approaches to herding build on the insight that we are born with a 
strategy and play it instinctively, for example strategies to provide food, escape predators and find mates, enabling the survival of the fittest. This idea is paralleled in evolution -
ary biology and neuroscience too. As noted by Camerer (2003b) the word “learning” in this context though may be misleading because it is not about individual learning and instead links to inherited strategies (e.g. in animals) and/or cultural evolution over long periods .
Herding behaviour is widely observed throughout the animal kingdom, in species 
as diverse as honeybees, ants, antelope, sheep and cows. Herding animals monitor the actions of others thus providing social information about resource availability and mating potential (Danchin et al.  2004). Evolutionary biology can help to explain why 
herding instincts are endemic. In other animals, especially our close relatives, herding may have (had) an evolutionary value in a social context; it is not just about individ -
uals maximizing their own outcomes. For example, animals will monitor the actions of other individuals as this gives social information about resource availability and mating potential (Danchin et al.  2004). Imitation has been selected for amongst mon -
keys as a successful strategy enabling the rapid transmission of good ideas throughout a species (Surowiecki 2004). Emotional contagion is observed in children, for example when they cry.
These herding tendencies also connect to less obviously rational drivers of our be -
haviours, including emotions – as we will explore in more depth in Chapter 9. Emo -
tional contagion is imitative and is, initially, a state of vicarious distress which precedes mind-reading abilities but may contribute to the development of empathetic capacities (Prinz 2005). Cohen (2005) argues that the human brain has evolved into a confeder -
ation of mechanisms that usually cooperate but sometimes compete. Proximate mech -
anisms such as herding, when motivated by emotional responses that appear irrational and motivated by emotions, in fact are engaging evolutionarily old but highly con -
served brain mechanisms which may be locally optimal but are not necessarily uni -
versally optimal. Also, instincts that have evolved to increase chances of survival may be just that – instinctual and therefore not manifested as a deliberative Bayesian-style thought  process.
Herding may have evolutionary advantages for humans too, not just because of 
informational influences but because the presence of more conformist individuals sus -
ceptible to intra-group pressure generates evolutionary advantages. Simon (1990) ar -
gues that, amongst social animals, the evolutionary fitness of altruists will exceed that of the selfish: “docility”, that is, receptivity to social influence, is an evolved instinct  91 EVolUtIon arY aPPro aCHE S to  lEar nIng
that has survived and permeated the human population to serve important evolution -
ary purposes. Docile people have the intelligence and motivation to learn quickly from 
social information and do not screen social information for contribution to personal fitness. Docility allows people to believe large numbers of propositions without any direct proof. Docile individuals are also more adept at social learning, making them more able to acquire knowledge, skills and “proper behaviors”, that is, the values, goals and attitudes that are useful in overcoming environmental obstacles, thus contribut -
ing to the evolutionary fitness of human populations. According to Simon, a genetic predisposition to imitate others has evolved to serve a social purpose in encouraging socially constructive empathy and altruism, helpful in overcoming dissent and con -
flict, though Simon does not allow that such conformism might also allow tyranny and oppression, illustrating the fact that the trait of docility may not necessarily suit a complex modern world.
These evolutionary theories can show how instincts such as herding have evolved 
in a social context, if not in an individual context. The way that humans make choices in risky situations (e.g. the overweighting of low probabilities, the dependence of prob -
ability judgements on context) are seen in animals too – for example in monkeys and 
 ho
neybees  – suggesting that human neural circuitry is “old”, and adapted to basic survival 
instincts (Camerer et al.  2004a,b).On the other hand, in evolutionary terms, instinctive 
tendencies may be more appropriate only in primitive settings: sociability and aversion to aggression may have evolved to allow the development of the stable social structures essential to the competitive success of small communities.
Herding instincts will be counterproductive if the survival purpose of evolved in -
stincts has been perverted by situational factors in modern “artificial” contexts. An in -
stinct to follow others may have been important to survival in a primitive setting but that does not mean that it is an effective strategy in the heavily interconnected globalized, computerized world in which assets, information and expectations can move very quickly. If large-scale herding, for example in financial markets, reflects the overriding influence of normative influence and/or emotional factors, then maybe herding is an inappropriate proximate mechanism and is not well suited to the modern context because it can gener -
ate instability on a very large scale. This raises the question of whether the basic instincts manifested in proximate mechanisms such as herding are well-adapted to a modern, technological age.
An evolutionary approach is not inconsistent with ideas about Bayesian reason -
ing, if Bayesian reasoning is a skill that has evolved to serve social purposes. For example, with heterogeneity in personality types, rule-based decision-making (such as 
 Ba
yesian updating) help s to ensure consensus is forged amongst divergent person -
alities, fostering effective societal decision-making processes despite natural heter -
ogeneity. However, human instincts are hardwired processes that have not evolved recently enough to be necessarily useful in a modern context. An ingrained instinct to herd may be a maladaptation in modern contexts, especially fast, liquid finan -

Models of learning from behavioural economics capture the fact that rational individuals 
do not move immediately towards equilibrium outcomes. It may take them a long time to reach equilibrium if they ever reach it at all. Learning processes are varied: we learn from our beliefs about others, based on how they have behaved in the past – an approach that is closely related to standard game theory analyses of evolutionary learning. However, psychological motivations are important too and these are developed into economic mod -
els of reinforcement learning by embedding insights from psychology about conditioning and reward learning.
Developments in neuroscience have also deepened our understanding of learning, 
for example the model of reward prediction error, explored in more depth in Chapter 12, captures the fact that we learn from our mistakes, an insight that links to models of expec -
tations conventionally seen in economics, including the adaptive expectations hypothesis. Another important device for learning is social learning and this can be understood axio -
matically in terms of Bayes’s rule but there are broader explanations too about the impact of others on our choices. Some of these social influences will be explored in more detail in the following chapter on sociality.
In terms of policy implications, the evidence about the effectiveness of markets as 
equilibrating devices is mixed . Learning,  by definition, cannot easily be understood 
in terms of static market models. In some learning experiments, players do play a rational mixed strategy equilibrium but at other times psychological factors such as memory and forgetting determine the path of learning. Also, as shown in the liter -
ature on beauty contests, there may be limits to the depth of reasoning , preventing 
people from reaching Nash equilibria. These insights are particularly relevant for financial markets in which social learning can have a large impact especially when speculators’ rewards are divorced from long-term performance. This will mean that incentives are constructed to encourage speculators to engage in iterated reasoning and participate in beauty contests rather than trying accurately to capture the true long-term value of assets. Overall, in devising policies to promote learning, insights about the constraints and influences on the learning by households and firms should be addressed.

.1 Mathematics of belief learning models
Cheung and Friedman (1997) construct a BL model with revised beliefs about states of the 
world and the following learning rule:
ˆ(1 )() ()
111
11stst st u
iiiui
ut
iu
ut∑
∑γ
γ+=+−
+=−
=−
Where sti() captures past states of the world for player i at time t and stiˆ() captures beliefs 
about the next period. Past states of the world are discounted by γ – a factor which can be 
interpreted as the learning parameter capturing the learning rate and/or memory length. It weights impact of historical observations with weights summing to 1. When 
γ=0, the 
past is irrelevant and the rule reduces to a Cournot rule; and γ=1 gives a fictitious play 
rule, i.e. all past observations are weighted equally and beliefs become a simple average of past states. Weighted fictitious play is described by 
γ<<01  where u captures the lag 
relative to the current period.
Decision rules can be constructed from this learning rule and Cheung and Friedman 
construct the following decision rule for ati() – person i ’s action in period t . For a given 
set of beliefs, probability of a first action – a – is given by:
Pat rt Fr t ii ii ii i αβ αβ == + (( )1 |ˆ();, )( ˆ())
rti() is the expected payoff difference from the first action, iβ is the evidence weight cap -
turing each player’s subjective responsiveness to the expected payoff difference; and iα is 
her idiosyncratic tendency to favour the first action.
a5.2 the mathematics of Erev and rot h’s 
reinforcement learning model
In their RL model, Erev and Roth first specify initial propensities and these are initially equal for all strategies, where 
qnk is player n ’s propensity to play strategy k .
When j = k the strategy is reinforced and the process of reinforcement is captured by 
a reinforcement function :
Rx xx=−() min
where x is the payoff from playing that strategy.
Erev and Roth vary the number of parameters in their model and the updating function  
for the 1-parameter model is given by:
(1 )() ()
()qtqt Rx ifjk
qt otherwis enjnj
nj+=+ = 95 a5.3 Ba YESI an U PDatIng a nD InForMatIon CaSCaDE S
This shows that propensity to play strategy j in the next period will increase if j k= 
and the strategy has been reinforced in period t , but if j k≠ there will be no reinforcement 
and the propensity to play j will be unchanged.
The probability – pnk that the player will play strategy k – is given by the probabilistic 
choice rule  reflecting the relative propensity to play k :
ptqt
qtnknk
nj∑=()()
()
For the 3-parameter model, the updating function is modified to incorporate forgetting 
and reinforcement spillovers from similar strategies:
ϕ +=− + qt qt Ej Rx nj nj k (1 )( 1) () (,())
where ϕ is the forgetting parameter and Ek⋅() is a spillover effect capturing the generalized 
experience of playing strategies k  which are similar to the selected strategy j . This partly re -
solves a problem with RL models, as noted above, that they cannot capture reinforcement from strategies not played. With this adjustment, even if a strategy has not been played before, its updating function can be modified if similar  strategies were played instead.
The generalized experience captured in the updating function is simplified by Erev 
and Roth into a “three-step” function capturing the spillover effects given various degrees of similarity between j and k :
ε
ε =−=

where ε captures experimentation/generalization and s is the payoff from playing strat -
egy k. As noted above, E k captures experience and includes learning spillover effects from 
similar strategies, moderated by forgetting (the recency effect) reducing the impact of past experience.
a5.3 Bayesian updating and information cascades
Anderson and Holt show people judge the probability that Urn A is being used accord -
ing to the choices of their predecessors, with choice s made sequentially by each subject 
in turn, and applying Bayes’s rule – an amalgamation of prior probabilities, conditional probabilities and posterior probabilities.
Prior probabilities
APr( ) and BPr( ) are the prior probabilities that the urn is, respectively, Urn A or Urn B and 
given that this is determined by the toss of a coin AB== Pr( )Pr( )12.
Conditional probabilities
Each player infers from their predecessors’ choice the colours of balls that they have cho -
sen. From the social signals ( n,m) they infer some combination of balls, where n is number 96 lEarn In g
of signals favouring Urn A , in which red balls are more likely , and m is number of signals 
favouring Urn B, in which black balls are more likely. nm A Pr( ,| ) is the conditional prob -
ability of signals ( n,m) if the urn is Urn A and nm B Pr( ,| )is the probability of seeing the 
combination ( n,m) if Urn B was used. The posterior probability that it is Urn A, is given 
by Bayes’s Rule:

Sociality and identity
As with other behavioural economics topics, theories of sociality and identity connect 
with insights from social sciences more broadly in differing degrees. Nowhere is this more apparent than in behavioural economists’ analyses of sociality. In some theories, social preferences are not much more than “add-ons” to standard economic theory. In other approaches, behavioural economists head more deeply into insights explored by social psychologists. In this book, we explore three specific themes about sociality that are highlighted within the behavioural economics literature on sociality: social preferences, social influences and identity. Social preferences are our preferences about other people’s outcomes – sometimes referred to as “‘other-regarding” preferences. They include our in -
clinations towards generosity and altruism, trust and reciprocity. People are motivated by goals reflecting their interactions with people around them. Social preferences are about what we prefer to see happen to others around us – and they are reflected in some of the social incentives and motivations which we explored in Chapter 2.
Social influences
Social influences have traction because most of us worry about how others’ beliefs, choices and actions affect our own beliefs, choices and actions. Sociologists divide these influences roughly into informational influences  versus normative influences . We explored some of the infor -
mational influences in the preceding chapter, Chapter 5 (see also Baddeley 2018). In this chapter, we explored  how we learn from the actions of others and so herding sometimes 
reflects our capacity for social learning. Normative influences are harder to analyze, almost by definition, because they are harder to capture in a mathematical model. Some normative influences  emerge, for example, when we feel social pressures to conform to others’ choices. 
Traditionally, economists have tended to focus more on informational influences and so -
cial psychologists more on normative influences. The two approaches are not mutually ex -
clusive, however, and behavioural economics is bringing the two together. Also, questions of identity – 
 ex
plored in different ways in economics versus social theory – mediate these 
two aspects of broad sociality explored by behavioural economists. Our identities mould our social preferences and our identities are, in turn, moulded by social influences from 98 SoCIalItY an D I DEntItY
others around us. Broader social influences will lead us to imitate others not only because 
of positive, informational influences from others but also because we are susceptible to normative influences such as social pressure and social norms.
Informational influences
Informational influences are captured in social learning models. In the learning models that we explored in Chapter 5, economists relax the assumption often seen in standard models that people act independently of others. Social learning models go further in incorporating others’ actions as a source of information and so we imitate other people because we are inferring something from their actions. Many social learning models are based on principles of Bayesian reasoning, in which people’s probabilistic judgements are updated in response to others’ actions (see Chamley 2003, Baddeley 2018 for sur -
veys). For example, if a person is facing a choice between two restaurants (Restaurant A 
and Restaurant B), their estimate of the likelihood that Restaurant B is better increases if they see a lot of people eating in Restaurant B. There are also alternative explanations for social learning and social influence, drawing on ideas from sociology and social psychology.
normative influences
Normative influences are driven by our evolved social natures and determine our recep -
tivity and susceptibility to social cues. Seabright (2004) analyses the importance of coop -
eration in social groups, and explores some of the evolutionary origins of cooperation, reciprocity and trustworthiness even amongst strangers. There is evidence that cognitive control has evolved within a social context; human children and chimpanzees use similar cognitive skills when dealing with physical tasks but human children have more sophisti -
cated cognitive skills when engaged in social tasks, including social learning and empathy or theory of mind (Herrmann et al.  2007). There is also anthropological evidence about 
the role of cultural factors; some cultures have no sharing norm suggesting that sharing is a cultural construct (Henrich et al.  2001).
Cooperation can also be sustained by social cues such as smiling. Centorrino et al.  
(2011) explore the role of smiling in cooperation and test the hypothesis that a convincing smile is costly but has evolved to sustain cooperation and trust. Using the trust game, they conducted experiments in which people watched video clips of potential trustees who were otherwise strangers before deciding whether not to send them money. The trustors were also asked to rate how genuine they found the trustees’ smile. Smiles from trustees playing for higher stakes were rated as significantly more convincing. The convincing smiles also were significantly correlated with the trustworthiness of the trustees as meas -
ured by their willingness to reciprocate by sending money back. Smiling was also found to be an honest signal: those smiling convincingly returned more money on average and this may reflect the fact that convincing smiles are costly and rewards from encouraging cooperation appear to induce effort.
Some insights from psychology can illuminate the drivers of social interaction. Eco -
nomic psychologist George Katona (1975, 1951) uses a cognitive psychology approach to analyse group learning. Herding reflects “stamping-in” of simple rules of thumb and  99 norMatIVE InFlUEnCE S
heuristics rather than problem-solving and understanding. According to Katona, learning 
is about relying on simple observation of others to acquire information. On the interac -
tions between individuals and groups in a social learning context, group forces and group motives are important, reflecting not only imitation and conscious identification with the group but also group-centered goals and behaviour. Imitation and suggestion reinforce group situations and group coherence but are not necessary conditions for being part of a group. Reference groups give standards for behaviour and group-centered belonging and motivation are more likely to be important in small groups. Social learning is more selective and simple than individual learning because people adopt short cuts and follow simplifying rules of thumb and routines. Imitation qualifies as a “fast and frugal heuris -
tic” in social situations (Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996; see also Chapter 3).
Nonetheless, empirically, it can be difficult to untangle group influences on individ -
ual behaviour (though neuroeconomic analyses can offer some insights, as explored in Chapters 11 and 12). The problem is that, as Manski (1993, 2000) observes in his analyses of reflection effects and social interactions, empirically it can be difficult to identify and separate group influences from contextual influences.
Insights from social psychology
To fully understand how normative influences operate in behavioural economic models, it is helpful to look closely at insights from social psychology. Social psychology blends psychology and sociology by reconciling psychological insights about the role of person -
ality and individual differences with the sociologist’s emphasis of group influence and context dependence.
Sociological forces create interdependence and encourage imitation and herding. So -
ciological forces interact with psychological forces and will affect individual behaviour if groups act in concert without any clear co-coordinating mechanism – explained by Carl Jung as the outcome of a collective unconscious, an inherited understanding which is universal in all of us. Early studies of social psychology also focused on the influences from crowds and group pressure on individual actions, drawing on themes from le Bon’s analysis of mob psychology and the hypnotic influence of crowds (le Bon 1896). In his analyses, le Bon asserts that sometimes crowds have identities of their own, and so crowds cannot be understood in terms of the individual members who form the crowd (see also Baddeley 2018). Some themes in social psychology have also developed from the psy -
choanalysts who followed some of Freud’s insights. Alfred Adler focused on conscious social factors and the connections between people and the world around them, including the inferiority and superiority complexes (Adler 1979). Herding as  the outcome of social 
pressure rather than rational calculation, is seen in a wide range of human behaviours, for example in formation of mob processes (e.g. flash mobs), political choice, consumer preferences (e.g. fashion trends, dietary choices) and financial speculation.
Festinger (1957) describes strong urges to overcome cognitive dissonance (intro -
duced in Chapter 3), that is, to establish non-contradictory belief systems and group influence can be important in reconciling dissonance. We may persuade ourselves to buy something at an excessively high price if we see others doing the same. In this way, in -
dividual differences of opinion are ignored and similarities in small parts of information are transmitted to large numbers of people. Sociocultural norms, attitudes, habits  and 100 SoCIalItY an D I DEntItY
membership of groups will influence decisions. Discussion of beliefs with friends and 
associates will mean that information selected is determined by the groups to which the listener belongs. Social learning will continue until the majority has a uniform belief system (Katona 1975).
Social learning theory
Social context is the focus of social learning theories as developed by Julian Rotter, Albert Bandura and Walter Mischel; these theories focus more on social influences in the context of how norms are learned and adopted – as a contrasting approach to the informational approaches associated with the economists’ models of social learning reflecting informa -
tional influences. These social psychologists rejected the strict determinism of the trait theorists by allowing that learning takes place within social contexts via observational learning and influences from role models. Rotter developed elements from personality theory and behaviourism to explain that behaviour is affected by subjective expectations which are influenced by personality; and external reinforcements which are influenced by external events including social context. Loci of control have internal (individual) and external (social) dimensions. Personalities with a strong internal locus of control take re -
sponsibility for their own actions. Those with a strong external locus of control attribute events to context, including social context (Rotter et al.  1972).
Albert Bandura analysed the impact of social learning and imitation, particularly o n 
aggression in children. Imitation of aggression was tested on a sample of 36 boys and 36 girls with an average age of 52 months. The children were divided into three treatment 
conditions: the control group; aggressive condition; and non-aggressive condition. For the aggressive and non-aggressive conditions, the children were given prior exposure to the behaviour of an adult role model. For this prior exposure, the children and their role models played in separate corners of a room. An inflatable “Bobo” doll was placed in the adult’s corner and the adult role model behaved in two ways: in the non-
 agg
ressive con -
dition, the adult role model ignored the doll; in the aggressive condition, the adult per -
formed a choreographed sequence of different violent acts towards the Bobo doll (striking with a mallet, kicking, punching the nose, verbal aggression, etc.). In the next stage, the behaviour of the children in the presence of the Bobo dolls (with no adult role model present) was analysed. Children in the aggressive condition were significantly more likely to engage in aggressive physical and verbal behaviours than the children in the non-
 
ag
gressive and control conditions; they were imitating the range of violent behaviours 
exhibited by their adult role models (Bandura et al.  1961).
These insights about social learning connect with behavioural economic analyses of 
social influence via family upbringing. Developmental psychology focuses on the role of education in embedding habits from a young age and these habits can be transferred within the family structure. Families , for example,  will be influenced (either via learn -
ing or via social pressure) by the recycling habits of other family members. Grønhøj and Thøgersen (2012) analyse the impact of parental attitudes and behaviour on ado -
lescents’ recycling behaviour. They focus on the fact that parents play a key role in teaching pro-environmental practices and the role of parental influence on values. Fam -
ily norms take two forms: descriptive norms – normative information is conveyed via parents’ actions; and injunctive norms – parental instructions to their children about  101 norMatIVE InFlUEnCE S
pro-environmental  behaviours.  Nonetheless, there may be differences across families, 
reflecting generation gaps and differences in parenting style. Also, issues of identity will 
be important – the extent to which the child identifies with the parents will affect the transmission of environmental values across generations.
Grønhøj and Thøgersen (2012) analyse evidence from a stratified sample of 601 Dan -
ish households representative of the Danish population in terms of socio-economic char -
acteristics. Families were interviewed via internet-based surveys with questions to capture the influence of individual pro-environmental attitudes versus the social influence of family norms on adolescents’ pro-environmental behaviour. Families were asked about attitudes and actions with respect to specific pro-environmental practices including buy -
ing eco-friendly products; reducing electricity use; and separation of waste for recycling. Adolescents were also asked about the parents’ attitudes and actions. The impacts of gen -
eration gaps, that is, the difference in age between parents and child, were also analysed alongside the relative weight of personal attitudes versus social influences.
Grønhøj and Thøgersen test three hypotheses: adolescents’ behaviour depends on 
family norms and is more influenced by descriptive norms than injunctive norms; the larger the generation gap, the weaker the influence of norms. They find that adolescents’ pro-environmental behaviour is heavily influenced by their own attitudes but also by the existence and strength of parental pro-environmental attitudes and actions. Parents’ ac -
tions, that is, the descriptive norms, dominate the injunctive norms and the impact of the descriptive norms is also dependent on the child’s perception of their parents’ behaviour, that is, the extent to which their parents’ actions are visible and unambiguous. Grønhøj and Thøgersen conclude that parents are important role models and can play a key role in moulding the pro-environmental behaviour of adolescents.
Social pressure
There is considerable evidence in social psychology that social contexts and social pres -
sures have a significant impact on individual decisions. A famous case is that of Kitty Genovese, a New York woman who was stabbed repeatedly whilst, according to some accounts, many neighbours looked on without helping or calling the police. This case is often used to illustrate constraints on social responsibility including bystander effects, diffusion of responsibility, social passivity and obedience to authority.
Milgram on obedience to authority
Many social psychologists and sociologists focus their analysis on understanding when and why we fail to cooperate with others in such stark ways. Stanley Milgram is famous for a number of experiments assessing social factors including social influences and social interactions. Milgram’s “six degrees of separation” study illustrated the density of social networks. A randomly selected “starting person” had to find a way to get a letter, via friends and acquaintances they knew personally, to a randomly selected “target person” whom they did not already know. The degree of separation was the number of people the starting person had to go through to get to the target person; the median was five intermediate persons amongst the (then) US population of approximately 200 million people (Milgram 1967). The experimental design was somewhat questionable but this 102 SoCIalItY an D I DEntItY
study nonetheless established the close connectedness of people and inspired the growth 
of social network theory in mathematics and economics, for example see Watts (2003), Watts and Strogatz (1998).
Another of Milgram’s studies analysed social influences, specifically obedience to au -
thority. Experimental subjects were instructed to punish other subjects’ mistakes with electric shocks. In reality, there were no shocks and the punished subjects were actors pretending to feel pain; the punishers didn’t realize this but were nonetheless willing to inflict close to fatal shocks on others when instructed to do so by experimenters. Their behaviour was interpreted as reflecting obedience to authority which the subjects ra -
tionalized by putting responsibility on the authority figure as the one really making the decisions (Milgram 1963).
Milgram’s shock experiment showed that people are affected by influence from oth -
ers, particularly authority figures. Haney, Banks and Zimbardo (1973) extended the anal -
ysis into a study of roles and situational influences. They constructed a mock prison with students allocated into roles of prisoner and guard. Haney et al . found that the students 
fell into their fake roles very quickly with both sets of students exhibiting aggressive behaviour. The student prisoners showed signs of feeling increasingly depersonalized, for example they began voluntarily identifying themselves by their prisoner number, not their name. The student guards inflicted real humiliations on the student prisoners. The study had to be stopped after just five days for ethical reasons: the students’ behaviour was becoming increasingly sadistic and pathological. The inference drawn was that people in harsh environments will react in increasingly antisocial ways because of the context in which they find themselves and not necessarily because of their personal characteris -
tics. Zimbardo later applied this insight in his witness testimony in the Abu Graibh trials (Haney et al. 1973; Zimbardo 2007). Tajfel (1970) also established that identity affects so -
cial interactions and contributes to discrimination.
asch’s line experiments
Solomon Asch (1955, 1956) studied social influence in a more benign context. He devised controlled experiments in which people were asked to make simple judgements about the lengths of lines. The subjects made their decisions in a group context without knowing that all the other experimental participants were collaborating with the experimenter. These collaborators were instructed by the experimenter to make deliberately false state -
ments about the length of the lines. A large minority of the experimental subjects were susceptible to intra-group pressure. They made mistakes in 37% of cases because they were persuaded by deliberately misleading decisions from the experimenter’s collabora -
tors and the effects increased with group size and consensus within the group. It is plau -
sible that situational pressures operate in an economic and financial context too though perhaps for information reasons as much as social reasons, for example in financial mar -
kets, as explored by Robert Shiller (Asch 1955, 1956; Bond and Smith 1996; Shiller 1995).
This analysis of how social pressure changes people’s judgements returns us to the 
debates about herding as the outcome of informational versus normative influences. In distinguishing social learning from social pressure, elements of Bayesian and socio-
 
ps
ychological theories may coincide. Herding may occur through beliefs in : first, the 
higher competence of the persons being observed; and second, simple group or peer  103 norMatIVE InFlUEnCE S
pressure without necessarily higher competence. To herd for the former reason would be 
rational and sensible; to herd for the latter reason would not.
In untangling normative influences from the informational influences explored in the 
previous chapter, purely Bayesian accounts are difficult to reconcile with experimental evidence showing that people follow majority opinion even if it contradicts more accurate private information (Asch 1955, 1956). Asch’s experiments demonstrated that experi -
mental subjects have a tendency, even with very unambiguous tasks, to make the wrong choice when they see a group making a wrong choice. This finding has been replicated in a large number of sociological studies (see Bond and Smith [ 1996] for a meta-analysis). Shiller (1995) argues that this evidence about the impact of social influence is not neces -
sarily inconsistent with the Bayesian hypotheses outlined above – it is just rational social learning taken to its extremes. Asch’s experimental subjects were making rational judge -
ments about the probabilities of different scenarios and concluding that a large group of other individuals was very unlikely to be wrong about a simple decision; the individuals judged that it was more likely that their own judgement was wrong. This led to a ten -
dency to discount personal perceptions in favour of the information communicated by the group (Shiller 1995). Shiller observes that herding operates even without face-to-face interactions and so is not therefore an outcome of social pressure. Instead, he argues that the response of large groups of people is taken as valid information because it is rationally assumed that large groups of people are unlikely to be wrong (Shiller, 1995). Also, social pressure may emerge from imagined responses as well as real and direct responses – for example, there is evidence that real and imagined events are associated with a similar cognitive response. Also, tendencies to herd may reflect individual differences including personality traits, such as empathy and conformity because these might generate predis -
positions to follow others.
Overall, decisions to follow others reflect sociological and psychological factors and 
lead us away from a dichotomous conception of herding as either rational or not rational, reflecting the fact that economics incorporates a binary categorisation of behaviour as either rational or irrational depending on whether behaviour does or does not conform to Bayesian rationality. Enlarging the analysis of herding away from conceiving of it as a purely objective phenomenon also allows the possibility that herding reflects interactions between different cognitive and emotional decision-making systems, which is some -
thing that neuroscientists and neuroeconomists explore and some neuroeconomic studies of 
 in
teracting neural systems are explored in the neuroeconomics chapters – Chapters 11 
and 12.
Social marketing
Social psychological principles can also be seen in psychological analyses of marketing and persuasion. Robert Cialdini (2007) analyses some of the principles of influence and persuasion including reciprocation; commitment and consistency; social proof; liking; authority; and scarcity. Reciprocation is a strong tendency in human behaviour, reflecting a sense of obligation to others . Cialdini cites a study in which a researcher sent Christmas 
cards to strangers and received many cards in return without people asking who he was and/or why he had sent them a card. Commitment and consistency reflects the fact that we are committed and consistent in our plans and actions which can create problems 104 SoCIalItY an D I DEntItY
when we are automatically consistent in a way that does not suit our own best interests. 
Similarly, we may force ourselves into thinking that we are being consistent, even when we are not – which links into issues of cognitive consistency and dissonance, discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. Social proof is about doing what others do and believing what others believe. Liking reflects the fact that when we are complimented by someone who is personable and attractive, then we will be inclined to like them and so inclined to do what they want us to do. We also like people more if they are similar to us. Peo -
ple are more likely to do what we want them to do if we have authority, as shown by Stanley Milgram, described above. Finally, scarcity affects our perceptions , according to 
Cialdini. When opportunities are limited and scarce, they seem more enticing. This can explain people’s susceptibility to scams and swindles ; for example the Bernard Madoff 
Ponzi scheme scam exposed in 2008 exploited the fact that people were willing to invest in a scheme when they were told that it was a rare opportunity available only to a few select, worthy investors.
❖ Case study:  ex perts, so Cia l influen Ces a nd herding 
heuristi Cs
Experts play a crucial role in policy-making but are as prone to social influences and 
other forms of bias as the rest of us. Tversky and Kahneman argue that accumulation of experience does not stop people from systematically misapplying heuristics if they do not have an opportunity to discover their own mistakes. They identified some of these biases in experts as well as amongst ordinary decision-makers. Experts will be sus -
ceptible to heuristics and biases even when they have had extensive statistical training. This reflects the fact that consistency in judgements does not necessarily reduce the chance of systematic mistakes. The gambler’s fallacy, for example, involves an as -
sumption that a long run of red wins on the roulette wheel will make a black win more likely on the next spin. Gamblers do not change their minds about this fallacy and so the gambler’s fallacy is not an internally inconsistent belief. The gambler’s belief is not unstable and so it does not violate standard economic rationality axioms. Nonetheless, it is not compatible with the more general objective belief that a roulette wheel has no memory and so cannot deliver a black win just because there has been “too long” a series of red wins.
Curtis (2012) notes that the background and experience of geologists did correlate with 
their ability to successfully interpret geological information, nonetheless experts are still susceptible to a range of biases reflecting subjectivity in expert decision-making. Baddeley, Curtis and Wood (2004) and Curtis (2012) have identified a number of bi -
ases in expert judgement including overconfidence, anchoring and motivational bias. In many cases where experts are involved in the elicitation of knowledge, the experts are individually overconfident about their knowledge and multiple experts undergo -
ing the same elicitation procedure will produce estimates of elicited parameter values which barely overlap. One way to overcome bias might be to collect a range of opinions simultaneously from a number of experts but in this setting the experts are susceptible to herding and social influences which may reflect the application of the availability  105 IDEn t ItY
heuristic as the judgements of others are often easily accessible. Polson and Curtis 
(2010) conducted an experiment in which experts were asked to interpret geological data and assess the probability of a geological fault. They were asked for their judge -
ments before, during and after group meetings and opinions changed significantly through the process even though there was no change in the objective information available to the experts.
Weisberg and Muldoon (2009) use modeling techniques to assess the efficacy of differ -
ent learning strategies amongst scientific experts contrasting follower strategies with 
maverick strategies. With the follower strategy, experts followed other experts rather than making their own tracks and as a consequence large parts of the epistemic land -
scape remained unexplored. Conversely, the maverick strategy, which involved avoid -
ing the research approaches of other experts, were considerably more successful and ensured that a larger area of the epistemic landscape was explored.
Identity
Another way in which social context can influence behaviour is via its impact on identity, 
and this is a theme that behavioural economists have explored extensively.
akerlof and kran ton’s identity theory
Economists have taken insights from experimental studies to develop economic models of identity. Akerlof and Kranton (2000, 2011) construct a model of identity based on social categories and argue that people’s identities are moulded by sociological factors. In their identity model, utility depends on identity or self-image, an individual’s own actions and the actions of others. They state that since the actions of self and others determine an indi -
vidual’s own consumption, the elements of their utility function are sufficient to capture standard economic variables.
Within their approach, identity is endogenous and is itself determined by individuals’ 
actions and the actions of others. Identity is also affected by social categories: this is a cate -
gorical model of identity. Finally, identity is affected by an individual’s characteristics and the extent to which those characteristics match the prescribed behaviour for a particular group. People have some limited choice over their identity but the pressures to remain within a particular category are strong and ostracism often makes it difficult for people to redefine their own identities. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) use their model to analyse identity in a number of different contexts. Actions that seem irrational in a standard model make more sense in an identity model: for example, self-mutilating actions such as tattooing, plastic surgery, body piercing, starvation and steroid abuse are irrational, costly acts from a standard economic perspective but, in a model of identity, they generate utility by reinforcing a person’s identity and sense of belonging to a group. The actions of others can also affect utility via identity. If a man is insulted and baited by his fellow workers, thereby undermining his masculine identity, he will experience disutility for 106 SoCIalItY an D I DEntItY
that reason. Violating prescriptions for a particular identity will also have impacts on util -
ity: if a person violates the prescriptive norms of their group, for example a man wears a 
dress, then this may have negative impact on others’ utility by undermining their sense of identity. Identity has wider impacts too: with herding for example, when a person iden -
tifies strongly with a group then their perceptions of social pressure from that group can lead them more easily to lose faith in their own judgments and copy the actions of others in their group. It might be rational to submit to group pressure, to empathize and to obey rules of etiquette in a world where social context is important and when social factors enhancing status and reputation are important.
Akerlof and Kranton’s approach has been criticized for its focus on the individual 
within social categories. Davis (2006, 2010) argues that identity is more complex than Akerlof and Kranton allow. Akerlof and Kranton embed identity into a standard frame -
work around utility function; in essence, it is about self-image broadly defined. Identity goes beyond self-image and the Akerlof and Kranton approach does not allow for multiple identities and does not distinguish personal identity from social identity.
Davis (2006) observes that there are two main alternatives to Akerlof and Kranton’s 
approach: Sen’s (1999, 2004) commitment approach and the complexity approach. In Sen’s approach, individuals recognize that groups and commitments to social groups re -
flect a recognition that groups and the behavioural rules that define those groups have an intrinsic value and so the value of the individual to the group is as important as the value of the group to the individual. Davis (2006) identifies another alternative to Akerlof and Kranton’s identity theory, the complexity models (e.g. Kirman and Teschl 2004) which focus on individuals interacting within social groups – not market institutions. People’s identities form via interactions with social groups and their social identifications with others, creating feedback effects between self-image and social context – a complexity not fully captured in Akerlof and Kranton’s individualistic approach.
Social identity theory
Identity can be incorporated into economic analyses of social interactions using insights from sociology and specifically from social identity theory. Impacts from the social groups around us will however be more pervasive if they affect our preferences, utility and identity. In these cases, sociality will lead to further violations of standard assump -
tions about independent homogenous agents. We have preferences not only for our own utility and welfare but also for those around us, as explored in behavioural economic models incorporating other regarding preferences. Behavioural economists have investi -
gated the impact of social preferences to explain departures from the standard assumption of self-interest. Some models incorporate sociality by incorporating social preferences as extra elements in people’s utility functions. This does not involve a radical departure from standard models and from the central assumption of rationality though it can help to explain evidence that seems anomalous in terms of standard approaches. Other models are more radical, for example analyses of social identity. These analyses take a broader view of sociality, moving from the focus in social learning theories on others’ actions as information into analyses of social preferences, rewards and interactions.
Sociologists have established that identities are easy to create and have a significant im -
pact on social behaviour. Tajfel (1970) conducted a study in which he randomly assigned  107 CHaPtEr S UMM arY
boys to groups using a minimal group paradigm which involves grouping people on a 
minimal, largely arbitrary basis. In this case, the boys were assigned to groups on the basis of whether they had underestimated or overestimated the number of dots in a visual image and whether they preferred one artist or another. Thus, identity was formed on the basis of very limited input. The boys were assessed as they played a penny game: they were asked to decide how many pennies they would give their group – the in-group; and how many pennies they would give to the other group – the out-group. The boys made offers which strongly favoured their own in-group. Tajfel (1970) and Tajfel and Turner (1979) developed social identity theory by applying these insights about the role played by social identity to analyses of intergroup conflict and discrimination.
Chen and Li (2009) found that induced group identity had a significant impact in 
increasing altruistic behaviour towards in-group versus out-group members. Subjects in their experiments were more generous towards in-group versus out-group members; they were also more likely to reward in-group members and less likely to punish in-group members, and showed substantial decreases in envy and increases in co-cooperativeness towards in-group versus out-group members.
As explored above, there is a large behavioural economic literature on sociality which 
explores experimental evidence showing that people often behave in altruistic and co -
operative ways and this is broadly inconsistent with a standard economic assumption of self-interest. A range of approaches can be constructed to capture other regarding pref -
erences and other forces generating cooperation, reciprocity and trust and these models focus on a range of assumptions about self-interest from Vernon L. Smith’s hypothesis that sociality is just another form of self-interest to models that focus on the idea that helping others is genuinely rewarding and is an end in itself.
Policy can be designed to harness our social natures. Policy “nudges” that incorporate 
social information and cues can be very effective not only in the context of environmental problems but also in encouraging people to cooperate in other ways, for example via or -
gan donation, by charity and philanthropy and/or by volunteering. Also, social networks, particularly via mobile and online networks, have become powerful tools for social coop -
eration, as witnessed by public demonstrations during the Arab Spring , the 2011 English 
riots and the #MeToo movement.
Chapter summary
 •Social influences on economic decision-making can be divided into categories of normative influences  versus informational influences .
 •Informational influences are about how people acquire information by observing the choices of others in a process of social learning. Economic models of social learning are grounded in Bayes’s hypothesis – which captures how people’s es -
timates of the chances of an event are updated as new information comes along. These Bayesian models capture when and how herding can be a rational decision, at least from the individual’s perspective, and were  explored in more depth in 
Chapter 5.
 •Normative influences are about how social norms and peer pressure feed into peo -
ple’s inclination to follow others in a less rational way.108 SoCIalItY an D I DEntItY
 •A range of experiments from social psychology have shown the ways in which people 
are inclined unconsciously to follow others, and this can explain other phenomena such as obedience to authority.
 •Identity is defined in different ways across the social sciences. Economic models of identity focus on the idea that people will engage in what might seem like perverse practices like tattoos and piercings but when these are signals to others in their in-groups, then they make sense within a rational cost–benefit calculus framework.
 •In social psychology, groups formed on the basis of a common identity can be formed quickly and easily – as identified by Tafjel and his colleagues in the context of the minimal group paradigm – but lead to destructive interactions between in-groups and out-groups, fuelling discrimination.

time and plans
Standard economics assumes that people are consistent when they plan their decisions 
over time. For a rational, consistent person it should make no difference whether they are choosing between something today versus tomorrow or between something in a year versus a year plus a day. Modern mainstream macroeconomics embeds these assumptions and is built on assumptions such as Milton Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis and Franco Modigliani’s life cycle hypothesis. Both postulate that people plan consumption over their lifetimes and so their decisions about the future should not change unless information changes. From our ordinary observations, however, we can see that many people struggle making consistent plans, especially over lengthy time horizons and one of the major contributions from behavioural economics comes in theories and principles that capture these problems of what behavioural economists call time inconsistency . People 
change their minds. Their decisions today often do not take full account of the future consequences and most of us are prone to temptation and procrastination.
Exponential discount functions
In capturing the limits to people’s ability to plan for the future, some behavioural econo -
mists start with adjustments to orthodox models of inter-temporal planning. In orthodox theory, our choices about current versus future decisions is driven by our rate of time preference and this is captured in economic models via a discounting assumption. Fol -
lowing from Fisher’s impatience principle, Samuelson (1937) assumed exponential dis -
counting with the discount rate – 
ρ as a stable preference parameter. Within exponential 
discounting, the discount rate is a positive number measuring impatience. A patient per -
son will have a lower discount rate and so will have a larger discount factor; they will value future rewards by a larger amount. With exponential discounting, the discount function declines at a constant rate but a choice between something today and tomorrow will be the same as a choice between something in a year versus a year and a day.
In the standard economic model, People’s choices will be stable over time. Deviations 
from the rationality come when time preferences shift, when people are impatient in the short run but patient in the long  run. Samuelson explicitly emphasized that his exponential 110 tIME  an D Pla nS
discounting assumption was not realistic but exponential discounting is now the stand -
ard discounting assumption seen in almost all modern economic theory.
Individual differences with exponential discounting
The exponential model can capture differences in preferences. If someone has a high 
discount rate and so values future outcomes less strongly then they can still be described as (impatiently) rational if their impatience is stable over time. For example, if someone is choosing between chocolate cake today versus chocolate cake tomorrow then their choice will be the same as if they are instead choosing between chocolate cake in a year versus a year and a day. Exponential discounting can capture impatience and if someone cannot wait even an hour for their piece of chocolate cake then that may just reflect a high discount rate. As long as they’d make the same choice for chocolate cake in a year’s time then their choices are still rational and consistent.
There may nonetheless be individual differences in discount rates. One study illumi -
nating these differences was conducted by Harrison, Lau and Williams (2002). They tested two standard hypotheses: first, discount rates do not differ across socio-demographic characteristics; second, for a given individual, discount rates do not vary over time. They used surveys conducted in June/July 1997 from a stratified sample of 268 people in the age range 19–75-year-olds, all of whom had participated in the European Community House -
hold Panel Survey (ECHP). They also collected demographic, health and financial informa -
tion. They asked the subjects to make decisions across four possible time horizons: 6, 12, 24 and 36 months with real monetary rewards allocated as a redeemable certificate. They were told that one of them would be randomly chosen to receive a large sum of money and if they won, they would choose either Option A (a smaller amount in one month) or Option B (a ‘menu’ of 20 possible higher payments to be made in seven months).
They analysed the responses and found an overall discount rate of 28.1%, which didn’t 
vary significantly across the time horizons. There were no gender-significant differences, but discount rates declined with age and discount rates were lower for higher educational levels, for skilled people, for those who were not students, for people who had invested more in education, for those owning houses, people before retirement, the employed (vs. unemployed) and/or good credit risks. They estimated a distribution of discount rates that was roughly normal.
There is also evidence from natural experiments about individual differences in peo -
ple’s forward planning. Warner and Pleeter (2001) analysed evidence from real-world decisions about pension choice using data on US military personnel payments upon vol -
untary separation. Military personnel were given two contract choices: a voluntary sep -
aration incentive (VSI) giving a regular annuity over time; versus a selective separation benefit (SSB), that is, one lump sum payment. They found that 30% of officers and 90% of enlisted personnel took the lump sum , implying relatively high discount rates with a 
mean discount rate of 26.0%. Analysing the data using probit techniques, they found that discount rates varied inversely with size of lump sum payment (in contrast to exponential discounting models in which the discount rate is assumed to be a constant, reflecting stable preferences). They also found significant demographic variation in discount rates, with white, female, college-educated personnel being less likely to take the SSB.
Cognition also plays a role in determining time preference. Warren and Pleeter iden-
tified lower discount rates in the top two “mental groups”, perhaps reflecting the fact  111 BEHaVIoUr al D ISCoUn t F UnCtIonS
that these groups are better able to understand/process information about inter-temporal 
choices and/or perhaps had just had access to better financial education. They argue that their evidence has external validity given that the military are representative of the av -
erage American. Individual differences will also lead to differences in attitudes towards social security programmes (Heckman 2001).
Personality is important too – as it is for economic decision-making more generally, 
as explored in Chapter 9. Personality affects people’s attitudes towards time though there can be problems with separating time preference and risk attitudes (Borghans et al.  2008). 
Green and Myerson (2004) assert that risk attitudes and time preferences belong to differ -
ent psychological processes and will react differently to the same effect. Increase in size of reward decreases the discount rate but increases risk aversion, for example. Risk pref -
erences are multidimensional and people will have different risk preferences across dif -
ferent domains. A person may be risk-loving with financial decisions but risk-averse with health decisions or vice versa. Perceptions of the risk-return trade-off are domain-specific (Borghans et al.  2008).
There is also a link between personality and rates of time preference as captured by 
the discount rate. One of the problems with establishing a link between personality and other individual differences and the rate of time preference is that self-report measures ignore problems of overconfidence and lack of insight. Someone may think that they are more patient than they actually are and so hypothetical choices are not a reliable test of time preference. There is also evidence that time preference parameters are not constant as postulated in standard economic approaches and people often use higher discount rates for real rewards than hypothetical rewards (Kirby 1997). Frederick et al. (2002) explore 
a wide range of empirical studies of time preference and find a wide range of estimated discount rates and also identify within-subject inconsistencies.
Behavioural discount functions
Behavioural anomalies
Frederick, Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2002) identify a number of anomalies that can -
not be captured within models incorporating exponential discounting of utility: gains are discounted more than losses; small outcomes are discounted more than large ones; choices are affected by delay–speed-up asymmetry, for example when buying video re -
corders, people’s discount rates are higher if they want speed-up delivery than if they want to delay it. People also have preferences for improving sequences, for example they prefer to see their salaries increasing over time, and this is inconsistent with a standard exponential discounting assumption but instead may reflect some of the heuristics and biases outlined in Chapter 3.
Angeletos et al. (2001) also give some examples of time inconsistency. Workers prefer 
a 20-minute break in 101 days rather than a 15-minute break in 100 days but exhibit pref -
erence reversals if they’re asked to decide in the immediate future. If asked for a decision today, they prefer a 15-minute break today than a 20-minute break tomorrow. Smokers are another example: on Monday they may prefer to quit smoking on Tuesday but on Tuesday change their minds and prefer to quit smoking on Wednesday. Another example that affects almost everyone – their alarm clocks: when planning the night before an early start people will choose an extra 15 minutes of wakefulness over 15 minutes of sleep but by 5.30 a.m. the following morning, they will choose an extra 15 minutes of sleep over an 112 tIME  an D Pla nS
extra 15 minutes of wakefulness. Overall, in many of our decisions, people exhibit more 
patience when they are making long-run choices.
animal models
A large volume of experimental evidence shows that people do not show consistency of choice over time. Early evidence about the consistency of people’s decisions over time comes from animal models and experiments. Early on in experimental psychology, the “Bischof-Köhler hypothesis” was put forward – that only humans can dissociate them -
selves from current motivations to take actions for future needs but there is significant ev -
idence against this hypothesis. Mulcahy and Call (2006) find that animals plan over time, for example bonobos and orangutans select, transport and save tools to use one hour later and 14 hours later and they infer that planning skills may have evolved in earlier species. Raby, Alexis, Dickinson and Clayton (2007) find that scrub jays make provisions for future needs by storing food when that food/food type will not be available in the morning.
Ainslie (1974) analysed impulse control in pigeons. The pigeons were placed in a 
soundproof chamber with a single key illuminated by red or green lights. If they pecked when the red light was on, they got a smaller, sooner reward. If they pecked when the green light was on, they got a larger reward later. Overall, the pigeons were impulsive, choosing small short-term gains at the expense of large long-term losses and the tendency to seek shorter access to immediately available food remained strong for up to as many as 20,000 trials. The more interesting finding was that their preferences for reinforcement at different delays changed with elapsing time leading to preference shifts. Some pigeons learned to peck at a key at an earlier time if, and only if, this made them unable to obtain the smaller reinforcement, so perhaps the pigeons were binding their own future free -
dom of choice by learning a pre-commitment device by pecking the green light.
Behavioural discounting models
Frederick , Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2002) outline a number of ways in which models 
of choice can be enriched to capture time inconsistency. A major innovation is in adjusting discounting assumptions, for example using behavioural  discounting assumptions , outlined 
later in this chapter, in place of the standard exponential discounting assumptions.
Frederick et al. (2002) also explain how time inconsistency can be captured by enrich -
ments of standard discounted utility models, for example by allowing habit formation and/or allowing utility to be affected by anticipation as well as current consumption. Similarly, given time inconsistency, temptation utility models can be constructed in which sophisti -
cated decision-makers anticipate lack of self-control and therefore pre-commit to respon -
sible strategies. When temptation is a problem, people have preferences for commitment.
Time inconsistency can also be explained as the outcome of interactions between 
multiple “selves ” within each individual. Strotz (1955/6) outlines a model in which 
more proximate satisfactions are overvalued relative to the more distant ones. The op -
timal plan of future behaviour may be inconsistent with optimizing future behaviour generating an “inter-temporal tussle” and if this tussle is not recognized, spendthrift or miserly behaviour will be observed. On the other hand, these inter-temporal conflicts between an individual’s different selves may be recognized and resolved via strategies of pre-commitment and/or consistent planning. Similarly, Ainslie (1991) describes hy -
perbolic discounting  as an inter-temporal  “internal  prisoner’s  dilemma”  and the best  113 BEHaVIoUr al D ISCoUn t F UnCtIonS
choice will depend on how far a person can predict their future perceptions. Conflict 
between a far-sighted responsible self versus an impetuous, myopic and shortsighted self has Freudian connotations of conflicts between the id and the ego and Ainslie and Haslam (1992) develop this interpretation in the context of Freudian themes of “ego-splitting”.
Emotions and visceral factors, which we will explore in more depth in Chapter 9, 
will also have an impact. Bernheim and Rangel (2009) focus on the impact of “hot” emotional versus cool, rational states of mind on inter-temporal choices. Similarly, Rick and Loewenstein (2008) suggest that examples of time inconsistency may reflect trade-offs between tangible and intangible rewards. Tangible rewards tend to arrive more quickly (e.g. smoking a cigarette) whereas distant outcomes (e.g. getting healthy) are less tangible. When decisions are triggered by immediately salient emotional factors then immediate tangible rewards will be preferred to later intangible rewards. Other behavioural factors will have an impact too. Cognitive bias can generate time inconsist -
ency if a projection bias leads people to underestimate the impacts of future changes; choice framing or bracketing leads people to consider only a small subset of choices at any one time ; or if reference points mean that people’s decisions are anchored to prior 
choices.
These insights can be incorporated into discount functions that decline more rapidly 
in the short-run than in the long-run and there are two main families of behavioural dis -
count function that capture this phenomenon: hyperbolic and quasi-
 hy
perbolic discount 
functions, the mathematics of which are outlined in Mathematical Appendix A7.1.
The consequences of these different assumptions for the evolution of discount factors 
over time, including exponential discount factors (ED), hyperbolic discount factors (HD) and quasi-hyperbolic discount factors (QHD) are illustrated in Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.2   Impact of different parameter assumptions on discount functionsThe discount functions depicted in Figure 7.1 embed specific assumptions about the 
magnitude of the various parameters and it is important to note that the paths of the 
discount factors are very sensitive to the magnitudes of these parameters, as shown in Figure  7.2.
Another interpretation of the evidence on time inconsistency is provided in models 
of sub-additive discounting – that is discounting divided up into little segments of time. Read (2001) argues that subadditive discounting can explaining declining impatience be -
cause discounting over a delay is greater when the interval is subdivided than when it is left undivided. People are less patient over shorter subintervals and so when the delay is divided into subintervals there will be more discounting than if the interval is left undi -
vided. Using three choice experiments he found no significant evidence that impatience declines over time and he explains the apparent preference reversals often attributed to hyperbolic discounting as the outcome of subadditive discounting. Apparently anomalous choices do not reflect impulsivity, that is, desire for immediate rewards, but instead are about the delays between rewards – the issue is not whether people are choosing between today and a year’s time; the same patterns would be observed if people were making choices between having something in a year versus two years. They are less patient over shorter spaces of time regardless of when the choices occur. 115 BEHaVIoUra l lIFE-CY ClE MoD ElS
time inconsistency in the real world
Time inconsistency can affect a range of real-world decision-making. Some behavioural 
economic analyses analyse behaviour by different types of people, defined according to how self-aware they are about potential time inconsistency problems. Two broad catego -
ries include naïfs and sophisticates. Sophisticates realise that they will have trouble with self-control. They are aware that they may be vulnerable to a time inconsistency problem, so they will bind their choices via pre-commitment strategies. For example, if a sophisti -
cated but time inconsistent person realises that they will have trouble saving money, then they may lock up their money in investments that they cannot easily sell. Naïfs, on the other hand, will not have the self-awareness to realise that they may be prone to problems with self-control. O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999, 2001) have explored these differences in types and they illustrate the problem with the example of students balancing their social lives with study commitments. In these experiments, students are told that they must complete an important essay within four weeks, but over that four weeks they also have opportunities to go to a different movie each week. For the first week, the movie is mediocre and missable, but the movies improve each week until in the final week, when the essay is due, a good blockbuster is showing. The sophisticates amongst the students will plan effectively by getting their essay finished sooner because they realise that, if they procrastinate, they will miss the good movie. The naïfs, on the other hand, do not plan effectively. They will procrastinate about writing the essay and so will miss the best movie in order to meet their essay deadline.
DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004) explore how firms respond to consumer bias by 
analysing a firm’s contract design incorporating partially naïve consumers with time-
 
in
consistent preferences. DellaVigna and Malmendier compare two types of purchases: 
investment goods with immediate costs and delayed benefits; and leisure goods with de-layed costs but immediate benefits, for example consumption funded using credit cards. This generates a number of inefficiencies including price distortions: leisure goods are priced above marginal costs and investment goods are priced below marginal cost. Empir -
ical evidence from credit cards, gambling, life insurance, mail order, mobile phone and time-share business show that time inconsistency lowers consumer welfare for naïfs but not sophisticates. (DellaVigna and Malmendier’s [2006] analysis of health club behaviour is explored in Chapter 10 .)
Behavioural life-cycle models
Behavioural life-cycle models incorporate insights about time inconsistency and present bias into otherwise standard approaches to life-cycle planning, constructing models to capture households’ financial planning over a lifetime, including decisions about con -
sumption, savings, pensions and investments. Overall, hyperbolics smooth consumption and savings less successfully than is assumed in the standard economic model incorporat -
ing exponential discounting. People tend to hold high levels of credit card debt alongside high levels of retirement wealth (especially in the form of housing) and cannot account for conflicts between short-run and long-run discount rates reflecting simultaneous pa -
tience and impatience (Angeletos et al.  2001). Behavioural models have greater external 
consistency in explaining the simultaneous existence of high stocks of illiquid wealth and large credit card debts: models incorporating quasi-hyperbolic discount functions can 116 tIME  an D Pla nS
incorporate parameters which predict that people will be more willing to hold savings 
in the form of illiquid wealth. At the same time, the costs of holding illiquid savings are balanced by the benefits of illiquid savings as a crude commitment technology preventing impulsive consumption splurges. Nonetheless, inter-temporal tussles will emerge because hyperbolics are holding little liquid wealth and are more tempted to take on credit card debt to fund instantaneous gratification.
Following Laibson (1997) and Harris and Laibson (2001), Angeletos et al. (2001) and 
Laibson et al. (2007) use the quasi-hyperbolic discount function within a structural mod -
elling approach. They adopt a modelling approach in preference to an experimental ap -
proach because they are concerned that there are different results between different sets of experiments. Experimental studies have some advantages. They can reveal the extent of individual socio-economic and demographic differences, and they are not prone to aggregation problems. Also, they can complement other forms of evidence. But exper -
imental findings may confound time preferences with other factors. Also, subjects may behave perversely because they doubt the trustworthiness of the experimenter. Experi -
mental tasks can be highly abstract and realistic which means that external validity may be limited, especially as experimenters are often reliant on student volunteers – rather than a broader and more representative range of participants – when conducting their experiments.
Angeletos et al. focus on some stylized facts including that US households accumulate 
relatively large stocks of wealth before retirement yet borrow actively on credit cards and their consumption is excessively sensitive to predictable income changes. Bernheim, Skinner and Weinberg (2001) found that consumption growth rates close to retirement do not vary with retirement wealth (versus Modigliani) and that there are discontinui -
ties in consumption at retirement (versus consumption smoothing). They conclude that there is little support for standard life-cycle models; their evidence is more consistent with rules of thumb, mental accounting and hyperbolic discounting in inter-temporal decision-making.
Angeletos, Laibson, Repetto, Tobacman and Weinberg (2001) and Laibson, Repetto 
and Tobacman (2007) develop these insights in constructing a structural buffer stock model analysing consumption/wealth patterns , building on Strotz (1955/6) , in which 
 in
ter-temporal decision-making is modelled as an intrapersonal strategic game between 
selves. They develop a standard economic theory of life-cycle planning (following Phelps and Pollak’s [ 1968] analysis of intergenerational time preferences) by incorporating buffer stocks but blended with a psychological model of self-control. Rational players are en -
gaged in intrapersonal and inter-temporal strategic tussles. They incorporate some key  
principles: labour income and liquidity constraints are uncertain; households can simul -
taneously borrow on credit cards whilst investing in illiquid investment assets (though simultaneously holding liquid assets and credit card debt is precluded). Quasi-hyperbolic discounting allows time variant discount functions in which short-term preferences fa -
vour immediate gratification whilst long-run preferences are to act patiently.
Quasi-hyperbolic discounting is consistent with predictions of quasi-hyperbolic dis -
counting for “sophisticates” who can anticipate conflict with earlier selves’ preferences so they will accumulate illiquid wealth sooner and hold it longer to protect themselves from future consumption splurges. This insight is consistent with Strotz’s observations about pre-commitment devices. It is also consistent with Laibson’s (1997) “golden eggs”  117 BEHaVIoUra l lIFE-CY ClE MoD ElS
hypothesis; it is not wise to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs; similarly illiquid as -
sets accrue benefits only if you can hold them for a long time (Harris and Laibson 2001). 
Limits on liquid wealth preventing consumption smoothing and co-movements between income and consumption are particularly pronounced around retirement, which conflicts with Hall’s random walk hypothesis that consumption follows a random walk and there -
fore exhibits no systematic tendencies or correlations. There may be high levels of credit card borrowing to fund instantaneous gratification. Whilst they focus their analysis on sophisticates, the behaviour of “naïfs” will be broadly similar, contrasting with O’Dono -
ghue and Rabin’s analysis (1999) in which naïfs and sophisticates adopt radically different behaviours.
The agents in Angeletos et al. ’s model are assumed to be inter-temporal utility max
-
im
izers, though not necessarily with stable inter-temporal preferences. The agents are 
assumed to be high school graduates with a 90-year maximum life and a working life extending from 20 to 63 years old. H ousehold size is allowed to  vary over a lifetime. 
Labour income is autocorrelated with shocks. Liquid assets are used as buffer stocks to enable riding out of transitory shocks. Illiquid assets yield a relatively high rate of return but transaction costs of $10k + 10% of value of asset prevent easy sale making the assets illiquid, paralleling some features of housing wealth, a major source of household wealth. 
 Tr
ansactions costs are made large enough to prevent the sale of illiquid assets before wealth 
is bequeathed to increase computational tractability but also because there are many par -
tially illiquid consumers given transactions costs and delays. With quasi-  hyp
erbolic dis -
counting, even small transactions costs generate complete illiquidity. Illiquid assets earn interest yielding an annual consumption flow of 5% but no capital gain occurs. Credit card debt attracts higher rate of interest (but adjusted for bankruptcy and inflation). There is a credit limit on credit card debt of 30% of mean income for each age cohort.
No analytical solution can be derived from the theoretical model and so the model 
is calibrated and simulated in two forms to allow the comparison of predictions from two possible discounting strategies: exponential discounting versus a quasi-hyperbolic discount. Calibration involves incorporating prior information into the equations to give forecasting equations which are matched with consumption and asset allocation data from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Labour income and size of shocks are calibrated to match empirical data on labour in -
come; the degree of present bias is assumed to be 
β=0.7, as typically measured in lab 
experiments and, consistent with SCF data, with a discount factor of 0.944. The age-  
de
pendent survival rate is calibrated from the US National Center for Health Statistics and 
the willingness to save is equalized to match real savings , with quasi-hyperbolic and expo -
nential discount factors used to ensure a match with SCF data on retirement savings stock. Stochastic elements are incorporated using random number generators. Finally, equilib -
rium strategies are computed numerically using these assumptions and prior information.
Angeletos et al. (2001) find co-movement of income and consumption in their simu -
lations with marginal propensities to consume from predictable income changes ranging from 0.19 to 0.33 for both exponentials and hyperbolic s. This contrasts with Hall’s random 
walk hypothesis and reflects the fact that low income early in life holds down consump -
tion because of borrowing constraints. Consumption peaks in midlife when household size is largest. “Hyperbolics” are more willing to hold illiquid wealth because whilst illiquidity is costly for both hyperbolics and exponentials, these costs are  balanced  by 118 tIME  an D Pla nS
the benefits of illiquidity for the hyperbolics. In comparison with the exponentials, hy -
perbolics have higher discount factors in the very long-run  and, if rational, will use a crude 
commitment technology to prevent splurging behaviour. This explains why they invest in 
illiquid assets whilst simultaneously running up credit card debt. With a perfect commit -
ment technology, exponentials would match hyperbolics. Exponentials are better at using buffer stocks and are more likely to accumulate liquid assets pre-retirement. Hyperbolics hold little liquid wealth and more credit card debt to fund instantaneous gratification. Overall, sophisticated hyperbolics smooth consumption less successfully than the expo -
nentials but they accumulate more illiquid assets earlier as a commitment device and because their very long-run  discount factor is relatively high.
Similarly, in Laibson et al. ’s (2007) analysis they impose and reject the restriction associ -
ated with exponential discounting, that is, assuming that the present bias parameter is equal to 1 (
β=1). This restriction is rejected at a 1% significance level. The model is consistent 
with different discount functions in the short run versus the long run, implying a high short-run discount rate (39.5%) alongside a low long-run rate (4.3%). Overall formal rejection of restricted exponential discounting case implying that short-run and long-run discount fac -
tors are not equal leads Laibson et al.  to reject the exponential discounting hypothesis overall. 
Exponential discounting cannot account for high levels of credit card debt alongside high levels of retirement wealth accumulation and cannot account for conflicts between short-run and long-run discount rates reflecting simultaneous patience and impatience. Quasi-
 
hy
perbolic discounting explains why illiquid wealth is accumulated at real interest rates of 
about 5% even whilst some households are accumulating credit card debt at 12%.
limitations of the ang eletos et al. behavioural life-cycle model
Whilst Angeletos et al.  and Laibson et al.  claim that their model fits better with real-world 
data, the differences in correlation are not large – using their data on the proportion of the population with relatively high liquid assets, the correlation coefficients between the exponential model and real data are 0.39 to 0.87; between the (quasi) hyperbolic model and real data are 0.44 to 0.87. Also, the finding that exponential and hyperbolic/quasi-
 
hy
perbolic discount functions intersect (implying that people are simultaneously prone 
to consumption splurges and patient with their “golden eggs” hyperbolic) is sensitive to the parameter values selected. Figure 6.2 shows the evolution of discount factors using parameter values for the HD and QHD functions matching more closely the parameters used in the calculation of the ED discount factors. The golden eggs result does not hold for all parameter values and sometimes HD gives consistently higher discount factors and this would be consistent with future bias not present bias. More work does need to be done in establishing the relative empirical merits of different behavioural life-cycle models and parameter estimates – potentially a rich seam for further research.
Mental effort and bracketing
The Nobel Prize-winning economist, Richard Thaler, provides an alternative behavioural view of how people deal with choices spread over time. Thaler (1981) conducted an early behavioural laboratory experiment with University of Oregon students, testing for time inconsistency by finding implicit time variant discount rates. His hypothesis was that  119 MEntal E FFor t an D BraCkEtIng
discount rates are time variant, that they vary inversely with size of payoff because waiting 
for reward requires mental effort and self-control. So the implicit discount rate for losses will be lower than for gains. The experimental design involved using questionnaires; three for gains and one for losses. For gains, subjects were told that they’d won money in a lot -
tery that was held by their bank; they could take the money now or wait and were asked to say how much they’d need to make waiting equivalent to getting payments now. For losses, they were told that they had a traffic ticket that they could pay now or later.
Thaler found very large median implicit discount rates. The median response for the 
equivalent of $15 in a year was $60, implying a (compounded) discount rate of 139. Im -
plicit discount rates drop sharply with size of prize and over time. The median discount rate for early prize of $15 versus same payment in three months was 277%; for a prize in three years it was 63%. Overall, choices between a $15 prize today versus a larger prize in three months suggested implicit discount rates of up to 277%; for a $3,000 prize today versus a larger prize in three years responses suggested implicit discount rate of 12%. Thaler also found sign effects. Implicit discount rates were higher for gains than they were for losses, and this fits with Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory (described in Chapter 4). In explaining these anomalies in inter-temporal decision-making, Thal -
er’s interpretations included the role of arithmetic errors in exponential calculations and self-control – differences in rewards over time need to be substantial and noticeable to expend effort on self-control.
Bracketing in labour supply
Time inconsistency can also lead to violations of the standard assumption about inter-  
te
mporal substitution of labour for leisure, as seen alongside an exponential discounting 
assumption in real business-cycle models. Standard approaches assume that people work when wages are high and consume leisure when wages are low, reflecting the marginal rate of inter-temporal substitution. In this case, there should be a positive labour supply response with more labour supplied when wages are high. Camerer et al.  (1997) assess this 
hypothesis using a natural experiment capturing the working patterns of New York City cab drivers. They argue that this is a good data set with which to study inter-temporal labour supply because there will be considerable fluctuations in wages day-to-day reflect -
ing fluctuations in demand – on holidays or when the subway breaks down, for example.
If cab drivers are rational inter-temporal maximizers in the sense presented in stand -
ard models, then they will work harder on busy days and less hard on quiet days. Camerer et al. collected data from 192 trip sheets for NYC cab drivers and estimated labour supply 
functions from the trip sheet data. Fare rates were fixed by the Taxi and Limousine Com -
mission (TLC). Their estimated labour supply curves were downward sloping because cab drivers made less effort on busier days giving negative  wage elasticities. They found little 
evidence of inter-temporal substitution: drivers tended to stop work sooner on busy “high wage” days perhaps consistent with target-setting. They address the potential problem of measurement error using instrumental variable estimation with fixed effects, with other drivers’ wages used as an instrument. They conclude that in general there are significantly negative wage elasticities for NYC cab drivers.
Camerer et al. list a few possible explanations but, according to them, the most com -
pelling explanation is daily income targeting – a type of bracketing. Bracketing is used to 120 tIME  an D Pla nS
simplify decisions by isolating them from a stream of more complex decisions so daily 
targeting means that people do not have the cognitive challenge of thinking over long time horizons. They don’t have to worry about what it’ll be like tomorrow or remember what it was like yesterday. This is also consistent with comparisons against a reference point or aspiration level and gives a simple decision-rule to use in the face of choice overload. Quitting early on some days may also ameliorate self-control problems. The cab drivers who stop early but at the same time everyday are pre-committing to a steady level of effort. Developing this habit stops them feeling tempted to quit early even on quiet days. Also, they might be tempted to fritter away the windfalls earned on the good days if they worked too hard on those days if windfall income is going into a mental account for luxuries.
❖ Case study: inter-temporal planning and the environment
Climate change and resource depletion are problems that will intensify over time. 
Similarly, decisions about energy-efficient consumption/investment involve costs now for benefits in the future. Given the importance of time to decisions affecting energy and the environment, the behavioural literature on inter-temporal decision-making, offers a number of relevant insights. McNamara and Grubb (2011) observe that energy is an abstract commodity – invisible and intangible and so learning about substituting towards more energy-efficient consumption is delayed by perceptions of risk and pro -
crastination. In resolving these problems, habits and planning will play a crucial role.
Behavioural discount functions for environmental decision-making
Environmental decisions are often taken with a view to the future and in judging future 
consequences, people will be affected by present bias. This links to dual-self models explored in this chapter. Thaler and Sunstein (2008) argue intrapersonal conflicts be -
tween a “Doer” self and a “Planner” self makes people unwilling to take action if the costs are immediate and the payoffs more distant, because the Doer prefers to spend less in the present. This can lead to an excessive focus on current costs/benefits rel -
ative to future costs/benefits encouraging procrastination and overindulgence. In an environmental context, it may also lead people to underestimate the benefits of envi -
ronmental actions. For example, even when long-term incentives and payoffs are sub -
stantial, only 19% of Europeans opt for home insulation and only 6% opt for eco-friendly cars (Pongiglione 2011 citing Special Eurobarometer Survey 75.1).
Hepburn, Duncan and Papachristodoulou (2010) apply hyperbolic discounting to a fish -
ery model: the fishery collapses because at minimum, the viable marginal rate of re -
turn is lower than the relatively high early-on discount rate and this may explain the 
demise of Canadian cod and Peruvian anchoveta fisheries. Allcott and Mullainathan (2010) also argue that environmental decision-making is affected by procrastination: attention wanders, peripheral factors subconsciously influence decisions and per -
ceptions , though commitment devices and default options can influence constructive 
choices and enable effective planning. 121 MEntal E FFor t an D BraCkEtIng
Brutscher (2011b) analyses temporal inconsistencies in energy decision-making us -
ing data from the Northern Ireland Continuous Household Survey. He analyses pre-  
pa
yment in household electricity consumption and finds that upfront payments are 
associated with higher electricity consumption than ex post payment even when trans -
actions costs are higher and feedback is given about electricity use. Using data from 
10,124 households, he explores links between the top-up behaviour of households us-ing pre-payment meters. Households will balance the costs and benefits of top-ups – topping-up is costly because of foregone interest but this is balanced by the benefit of convenience. Topping-up a pre-payment meter means that the household does not have to make a payment every time they use electricity. (See also Gourville and Soman [1998] on temporally separating payments from consumption.)
Brutscher identifies two behavioural anomalies in households’ electricity consump -
tion. People top-up more often with smaller amounts than optimal and increases in 
tariff do not lead to equal changes in number and amounts of top-up; they just lead to increases in the number of top-ups. These anomalies cannot be explained by learn -
ing because there is little adjustment in months following change in tariff so learning is slow or non-existent. Top-ups may be used as a pre-commitment device enabling households to save electricity and resolve the conflict between an impatient present self and a patient future self. A sophisticated agent will look for a pre-commitment de -
vice but this does not explain the asymmetric adjustment of number versus amount of top-ups. If the behaviour reflects pre-commitment then there should still be a unique optimal top-up amount but the survey evidence shows people adjusting by choosing different top-up amounts depending on the timing.
Another explanation draws on Thaler’s mental accounting model (explored in 
 Ch
apter   13). People perceive costs differently and whilst each £10 payment seems 
trivial, one larger £100 payment does not. To test these insights,  Brutscher uses data 
from a natural experiment to analyse the impact of an exogenous increase in minimum 
top-up amount. An increase in minimum top-up amount from £2 to £15 was imple -
mented in May 2009 and this did lead to decreases in electricity use: electricity con -
sumption decreased by around 15 KWh as a result of the change in minimum top-up and this is consistent with mental accounting models in which people treat small amounts as trivial even when paid more frequently (Brutscher 2011b).
goal
s, planning and feedback
Intentions do not always translate into action and often there are conflicts between declared intentions and actual action, which may reflect preference reversals and/or naïve inter-temporal decision-making. A Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM) survey indicated that whilst 70% of Italians surveyed are willing to increase energy savings, only 2% are currently reducing their use (Pongiglione 2011). People may want to reduce emissions but will not approve of this if it has tangible consequences for themselves. American survey evidence shows that 78% of Americans oppose gasoline tax and 60% oppose business energy taxes (Leiserowitz 2006). Even though people may express 122 tIME  an D Pla nS
concerns about climate change, there is limited real commitment to environmental ac -
tion by Americans: 52% of Americans claimed to support the Kyoto Treaty in principle 
but if they had to pay an extra $50 per month then they would oppose it (Sunstein 2006).
Goals modify behaviour; ambitious goals lead to greater and more prolonged effort 
(Locke and Latham 2002). Planning is also important because effective behaviour is not just about intention; behavioural control including self-confidence guides action (Ajzen 1991). Whilst standard economics emphasizes the role of monetary incentives, Bamberg (2002) analyses two environmental behaviours – using a new bus route and shopping in a bio-shop. He finds that forming intentions is not just about the goal itself. Intentions about implementing the new behaviours increases their likelihood and so implementation intentions can substitute for monetary incentives. Monetary incentives alone increase the likelihood of environmentally sensitive behaviour but additional implementation incentives do not increase the likelihood of environmentally sensi -
tive behaviour any further. Intentions can be reinforced when people make concrete pre-commitments to conserving energy, and commitments may endure even when the initial incentive to commit is temporary. Cialdini (2007) describes the enduring impact of “lowball” tactics in promoting changes in habits – a lowball being a tempter offer which is later withdrawn.
Becker (1978) emphasizes the importance for inter-temporal planning of feedback 
alongside hard goals. He analysed the behaviour of US families in identical three-
 
be
droom houses: 80 families were asked to set goals for reducing energy consumption 
during the summer: half were set an easy goal; the other half were set a difficult goal. Half of each group were given regular feedback three times per week. An additional 20 families were used as a control group. The group with the difficult goal and regular feedback was the only group to consume significantly less electricity; they reduced their electricity consumption by at least 13%.
Overall, the theories and evidence outlined in this chapter demonstrate that the standard 
assumption of exponential discounting has a number of limitations and does not effec -
tively capture empirical patterns observed in natural and lab experiments. Evidence from simulations of models calibrated using some parameter estimates from experimental studies also generate predictions about consumption, savings and investment that match real-world behaviour more effectively than exponential discounting models, though these models do suffer from the limitation that they have no analytical solution and therefore the parameterization process is somewhat subjective. Time inconsistency and preference reversals can also be explained in terms of psychological factors including emotions and visceral factors, as explained in more detail in Chapter 9 . The literatures on time incon -
sistency and emotions link up in explaining bad habits, including addictive behaviours, as explored in the following chapters.
Time inconsistency, preference reversals and present bias can distort effective 
 de
cision-making in a number of domains. Overall, policies could be designed to accom -
modate the extent of sophistication in people’s understanding of their own susceptibility  123 rEVISI on q UE StIo nS
to time inconsistency. If many consumers are naïfs, time inconsistency creates problems 
not only for the individual affected but also has implications for the allocation of re -
sources more generally and can generate negative externalities. Policies to ameliorate time inconsistency are not just about interfering with the free choices of individuals but are about getting more efficient outcomes for the economy more widely, depending on the proportion of naïfs and sophisticates in a population.
Overall, recognizing the interplay of present bias with other behavioural biases can 
enable governments to design effective policies not only to enable effective financial 
 de
cision-making but also in other spheres, including moderating the impact of behav -
ioural factors on destructive behaviours and bad habits such as addiction, as explored in the next chapter.
Chapter summary
 •Behavioural economic theories of time inconsistency take on the standard assump -
tion in mainstream economics that decision-makers’ rate of time preference, that is their discount rate, is stable. Behavioural economists explore the possibility that our discount rates are not stable.
 •Unstable discount rates explain the common everyday problem of present bias – seen when people overweight short-term gains relative to long-term gains.
 •Present bias is linked to time inconsistency: when looking at a choice over a given interval – say one – day, if people are thinking about prospects today versus tomor -
row they will tend to overweight today’s prospects over tomorrow’s, but if they are thinking about prospects in a year versus a year and a day, they will tend to give higher weight to a year and a day.
 •Some behavioural economists capture time inconsistency via alternative specifica -
tions of the discount function. In orthodox economics, the discount function embeds a fixed rate of time preference to give an exponential discount function. In behav -
ioural economists’ specifications of the discount function, including hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic forms, the rate of time preference is variable.
 •Other behavioural economists take a different view of time inconsistency, arguing that people’s choices are determined by the context and so framing and bracketing will drive people’s choices.
 •Problems of present bias and time inconsistency are very common and affect a wide range of everyday decision-making – for example, energy decision-making, as ex -
plored in the case study in this chapter.

1 Some mathematics of discount functions
Exponential discounting
The standard exponential discount factor D(t) is given by:

1Dttt
δρ==+


Hyperbolic discounting
With hyperbolic discounting, the discount function is constructed to be a function only 
of time, in its simplest form as:
Dttγ
α=+()1
This version of hyperbolic discounting incorporates γ into the numerator but some ver -
sions assume γ=1 which bounds the discount factors between the empirically plausible 
bounds of 0 and 1, and also enables meaningful comparison with other discount functions.
quasi-hyperbolic discounting
Discounted utility is given by the following inter-temporal Euler relation:
UE uc uc tt tt∑βδ =+

ττ+ () ()
where τ is the number of periods of delay relative to the current period – t.
The discrete time discount function evolves over time as:
βδ βδ βδ βδ{ } 1, ,, ,, ...23 4
where β captures present bias. If β<<01 , this discount structure mimics the qualitative 
features of the hyperbolic discount function but if β=1 the discount function reverts to 
the standard discount function as seen in exponential discounting models.
Laibson (1997) and O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999) show that the quasi-hyperbolic dis -
count functions generate discount factors which decline over time, as for exponential discount functions, but with the rate of decline distorted by the degree of present bias –
β. Quasi-  
hy
perbolic discount functions converge on exponential discount functions as β approaches 1.
Harris and Laibson (2001) compare exponential discount functions with quasi-  
hy
perbolic discount functions. With exponential discounting, from the perspective of 
self at time t the inter-temporal marginal rate of substitution, that is, the ratio of marginal 
utilities between two choices with equal time intervals, should be the same. The mar -
ginal rate of substitution of consumption in period t+1 relative to t+2 will be equal to 
 mar
ginal  rate of substitution in period t+k+1 and t+k+2. Quasi-hyperbolic discounting 
splices together the standard exponential discounting model with the present bias param -
eter. This generates models in which marginal rates of substitution differ over equivalent time intervals and the marginal rate of substitution in period t+1 relative to t+2 will be greater than the marginal rate of substitution in period t+k+1 relative to t+k+2.Chapter 8
Bad habits
Orthodox economics is based on assumptions of rational, forward-looking agents and – 
within these approaches – self-destructive habits and addictions are anomalous. Behav -
ioural economics offers some deeper insights into what motivates people to do things that adversely affect their future well-being. Potentially, bad habits and addiction can be explained via models of present bias, time inconsistency and preference reversals, as outlined in the previous chapter. So far however, the analysis in economics has tended to focus on rational addiction models based on exponential discounting assumptions.
In this chapter, we explore rational addiction models and related empirical evidence. 
The rational addiction analyses suggest that bad habits and addictive behaviour are rational choices but may still be associated with negative externalities and other market failures. Other models relax rationality assumptions to allow that environment and context will affect vulnerability to addictive behaviour, for example the cue-trigger consumption mod -
els of Laibson and Bernheim and Rangel. Some approaches focus on emotional, visceral and neurobiological factors, for example analyses by Loewenstein, and Tasnádi and  Smith.
Evidence about smoking is covered extensively in empirical studies of addiction, per -
haps because smoking is a legal activity, its consumption is easy to measure, and it has been well known for a long time that smoking is very bad for you. The health effects from smoking cost governments a lot of money. For these reasons, good data that is relatively easy to interpret is widely available. For other bad habits, more data and analysis are be -
coming available about  bad lifestyle habits and their impacts on health.
rational addiction models
Standard approaches to analysing addiction are associated with rational addiction models initially developed by Becker, Grossman and Murphy (BGM). Generally, these models and analyses are applied to smoking habits but similar concepts will apply to other bad habits, and some of these are explored in more detail below. Rational addiction theories confront the conventional wisdom about addictive consumption which asserts that addictive sub -
stances are not price-responsive because they reflect irrational impulses.126 BaD HaB I tS
Becker, grossman and Murphy’s model
The theoretical background to the model of rational addiction is outlined in Becker and 
Murphy (1988) and also BGM (1991, 1994). BGM assume that consumers are rational and forward-looking with time-consistent preferences so addiction is not myopic. Rational consumers anticipate the future consequences of current actions and this can be captured by relaxing the assumption of separable utility instead allowing utility in each period to depend on previous and future consumption.
addictive capital stock
A central element of the model is the stock of addictive capital and for this reason some of the analytical features of BGM’s model resemble features in Solow’s macroeconomic model of growth  (Solow 1956) . The stock of addictive capital builds up with past con -
sumption of addictive substances and stressful life-cycle triggers such as divorce. Once the steady state is reached the stock of addictive capital will be stable, unchanging.
adjacent complementarity, tolerance and reinforcement
Intuitively, the adjacent complementarity condition holds when consumption of goods in adjacent periods is complementary. This reflects some basic characteristics of addictive be -
haviour including tolerance and reinforcement. Addicts need to consume more of an addic -
tive substance as consumption increases generating tolerance: past consumption lowers the 
marginal utility of consumption today and tomorrow. Reinforcement captures the fact that increases in past consumption lead to increases in the stock of addictive capital, increasing present consumption.
Putting these together, BGM outline the adjacent complementarity condition. Addic -
tion is consistent with rational utility maximization given expectations of future harm from addiction, but only if there is adjacent complementarity, that is, only if positive im -
pact of increased addictive stock in reinforcing the marginal utility of current consump -
tion exceeds the negative effect of higher addictive stock on tolerance. In this case, past (current) consumption will lead to greater current (future) consumption. The mathemat -
ics of Becker, Grossman and Murphy’s model is outlined in Mathematical Appendix A8.1.
Using this model, BGM predict that consumption of addictive goods is likely to be 
price responsive and that strong addictions imply more price-elastic responses in the long-run. Multiple equilibria and unstable steady states will mean that addiction is sensitive to initial stock of addictive capital. The mechanisms underlying BGM’s rational addiction model are illustrated in Figure 8.1.
Figure 7.1a illustrates that there are multiple equilibria in the rational addiction model. 
There is an unstable steady state at point [0]: consumption is relatively low so addictive stock is depreciating faster than it accumulates. Even if consumption is initially positive, eventually the consumer will stop addictive consumption and return to zero consumption.
At point [2] consumption is stable. If consumption decreases it is still greater than 
replacement rate so the addictive stock will increase again. If consumption rises, it will be less than needed for replacement so it will fall again. Either way consumption will return to point [2]. 127 ratIonal a DD ICtIon  MoDElS
On the other hand, [ 1 ] is locally and globally unstable: small perturbations rightwards 
will lead to increasing contributions to the stock of addictive capital until the consumer 
converges on point [2]. Similarly, decreases in consumption will lead to insufficient re -
placement of the stock of addictive capital and the consumer will converge on [0].
The existence of these different equilibria explains the unstable behaviour seen 
amongst many consumers of additive substances. In steady states, the same person can use heavily and at other times give up because impacts are multiplied; for example, if the price decreases, consumption shifts from [0]<c<[ 1 ] to c>[ 1 ] and the impacts of the price decrease will be magnified leading to increased demand as the consumer shifts to a new steady state at [2].
In terms of the dynamic, inter-temporal aspects of addictive consumption, BGM al -
low that addiction is more likely if the consumer discounts the future heavily, and/or pays less attention to future consequences. In this case, the effects of reinforcement will outweigh those from tolerance. If there is rapid depreciation of addictive stock, current consumption has smaller negative effects and harmful effects will disappear. There will be different responses in the short-run versus the long-run, as illustrated in Figure 71b. Given a fall in prices, demand for the addictive substance rises from A1 to A2 in two stages: in the short run, consumption rises from c1 to c2; in the long run it rises from c2 to c3. It follows therefore that long-run impacts will exceed short-run impacts. Initial in-creases in addictive consumption flow into stocks of addictive capital stimulating further growth in consumption.
Becker and Murphy’s empirical evidence
BGM put forward a number of empirical hypotheses which follow from their model. The long-run price elasticity of demand (LRPED) of smoking consumption will be sizeable and larger than the short-run price elasticity of demand (SRPED). High future and past prices will reduce current consumption reflecting adjacent complementarity. People on lower incomes will tend to have higher discount rates and will respond more to price changes than people on higher incomes, with lower discount rates. People on higher incomes will respond more to future harmful effects and younger people will be more responsive to price changes than older people.Sc2c = δS

Figure 8.1   Becker, Grossman and Murphy’s rational addiction model128 BaD HaB I tS
It follows from BGM’s models that current and past consumption will be complemen -
tary and consumption in the  period of time will be affected both by consumption in the 
last period and by consumption in the future period. Consumption in all periods will be 
correlated. In contrast to BGM’s approach, myopic models of addiction are explored by Pollak (1970, 1976) and Yaari (1977) who explain that myopic individuals fail to consider impacts of current utility on future utility and consumption; because they ignore future effects, consumption becomes entirely backward-looking. Myopic addicts would not in -
crease consumption in the face of expectations of price increases.
BGM construct an empirical test to separate models of rational addiction from mod -
els of myopic addiction. If the parameter on past consumption is significantly greater than zero and the parameter on future consumption is not significantly different from zero, then this confirms a hypothesis that addiction is myopic. Similarly, if the param -
eter estimate on future consumption is insignificantly different from zero, then future prices are not affecting current consumption, which again would be consistent with myopic  addiction.
On the other hand, if the parameters on past and future consumption are both sig -
nificantly greater than zero, then consumption across time periods is complementary across time. Past, present and future consumption are affected by each other and this is consistent with BGM’s model. If lower prices today lead to increased consumption today and tomorrow, this again is consistent with complementarities in consumption over time, consistent with rational addiction. For rational forward-looking agents, if price falls are anticipated then consumption in the past period and the current period will both rise; similarly rises in consumption in the future period will lead to rises in consumption in future periods.
Some empirical hypotheses about permanent versus temporary price changes can 
also be formulated. Permanent price falls will have a larger effect on current consumption than temporary falls because they imply  a fall in all future prices and therefore a rise in 
all future consumption; it follows – as noted above – that the LRPED will be greater than the SRPED.
BGM (1994) test these hypotheses using various econometric techniques. They make 
the basic rational addiction model more tractable by setting out an empirical model in which current consumption is a function of past and future consumption, current prices and life-cycle events (captured within an error term). To test their hypotheses BGM use data on cigarette sales and prices for US state cross sections from 1955–1985 for 50 US states. Some data points are missing so, overall, they have a panel data set with 1581 observations.
They capture price variability using state excise taxes; variation in tax rates leads to 
substantial variation in retail prices. They note a number of limitations in the data. The impact of health education will change the temporal patterns but they hope that this will be captured by the time dummies. Demographic differences may affect patterns so they 
assume that these do not correlate with interstate tax/price differentials. Smuggling of cigarettes across state borders will mean that sales do not necessarily correlate with con -
sumption so they use tax differentials to construct smuggling incentive variables for ex -
ports/imports. One key problem is that they are using aggregate data and so cannot study the decision of each individual smoker and this issue is addressed in analyses of smoking using microeconomic data, for example Chaloupka’s (1991) study (discussed below). 129 ratIonal a DD ICtIon  MoDElS
BGM do not use ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation because of potential endoge -
neity problems. The error term capturing life-cycle events will probably be serially corre -
lated and even if it is not, it will affect consumption at all dates and the inclusion of both 
leads and lags on variables creates an additional potential source of endogeneity. Instead, 
they use instrumental variable (IV) estimation with lead and lagged prices as instruments. They use fixed effects with two stage least squares (FE2SLS) and incorporate the fixed ef -
fects to resolve heterogeneity bias.
Using this data set, BGM estimate SRPEDs between 
−0.436  and −0.355  and LRPEDs 
between −0.734  and −0.788 . They conclude that findings are consistent with addiction 
generally. On the inference about myopic versus rational addiction, they note that their results are consistent with myopic addiction because lagged consumption is a significant determinant of current consumption and, whilst the future consumption parameter is significant , it has not been reliably estimated because it implies implausible discount fac -
tors of between 56.3 and 222.6%.
Overall, BGM’s results were mixed; partly the findings are consistent with the hy -
potheses from the BGM model but the econometric problems are significant. Hausman tests suggested that the estimates were inconsistent; the data were not rich enough ac -
curately to pin down the discount factor. A source of potential measurement error came from using actual future prices rather than expected  future prices, which could generate 
another source of endogeneity. BGM admit that their results are mixed: “The conclusions to be drawn from these tests of the estimates in Tables 3 and 5 depend on one’s priors”.
other econometric studies of addiction
BGM’s analysis triggered a range of econometric analyses of smoking patterns and some of these studies incorporated additional elements to address some of the limitations in BGM’s approach. As explained below, Gruber and Köszegi recognize that time inconsistency may play a role; Baltagi and Griffin use a wider range of econometric techniques to resolve endogeneity problems and Chaloupka uses microeconomic data to overcome potential aggregation problems. Other studies test the rational addiction model on other forms of addiction including alcoholism, caffeine addiction and gambling.
gruber and kö szegi’s analysis
In analysing addiction, Gruber and Köszegi (2001) use consumption as well as sales data. Price increases may lead to stockpiling and this leads to an implication similar to that iden -
tified by BGM: increased sales do not equal increased consumption. Whilst Gruber and Köszegi’s model is about rational addicts in the sense that it incorporates forward-looking decisions, they do relax the assumption about time consistency allowing that addiction reflects time inconsistency. They note that many psychological experiments have revealed evidence of time inconsistent preferences. Also, the fact that so many people buy quitting aids is evidence that future behaviour does not always coincide with current desires.
To resolve the problems of endogeneity bias, Gruber and Köszegi assume that true ex -
ogenous variation comes from taxes and they analyse consumers’ responses to tax changes using data on consumption as well as sales. Gruber and Köszegi’s analysis relies on the as -
sumption that people forecast prices in advance but policy changes aren’t always announced  130 BaD HaB I tS
in advance; only eight of 160 tax changes from 1973 to 1996 had been announced a year 
before. They analyse behaviour in response to legislative changes in tax rates between the time of “enactment” – when the tax rate change was enacted – and when it was “effec -
tive” to capture consumption period in the period between announcement and imple -
mentation. In this way, they test forward-looking behaviour by examining consumption in the period between enactment of legislation and when change becomes effective.
Using panel fixed effects estimation techniques incorporating time and state dum -
mies to capture time-invariant effects and spatial heterogeneity, they examine data from 1973–1996. During this period, there were 36 tax changes enacted and effective in same month; 44 tax changes enacted and effective were in consecutive months; and 68 tax changes had at least one month between enactment and implementation. Gruber and 
Köszegi justify their assumption of no omitted variable bias on the basis that they are us -
ing high-frequency monthly data and preference structures wouldn’t have time to change over such a short period. For consumption data, they use the Vital Statistics Detailed Na -
tality Data 1989–1996 on mothers’ smoking habits, averaged to give state average monthly consumption per capita.
Gruber and Köszegi find that the coefficient on the pre-announced rate is positive and 
highly significant. This suggests a hoarding effect – a type of forward-looking behaviour. These results are consistent with other analyses and partly confirm the findings from BGM’s analyses of rational addiction. Consumption does jump in anticipation of tax rises also suggesting that rational hoarding is taking place, though they do note that it is dif -
ficult empirically to separate addiction models with rational time-consistent preferences from models with myopic/time-inconsistent preferences.
In terms of implications, Gruber and Köszegi emphasize that policy-makers should 
worry about internalities. With time-consistent preferences, smoking generates external -
ities. With time-inconsistent preferences, internalities are generated too: the individual smoker imposes costs on their future selves reflecting future health problems. So 
 Gru
ber 
and Köszegi argue that policy-makers should adjust cigarette taxes to reflect these in -
ternalities as well as externalities. At standard values of life measures, internalities are estimated to be $30.45 per pack in lost life expectancy, that is, 100 times the externalities from smoking. Significant internalities mean that optimal tax rates should be at least a dollar higher even for modest time inconsistency
Baltagi and gri ffin’s analysis
Baltagi and Griffin (2001) are strongly critical of empirical findings from BGM given the econometric problems with their analysis . They study smoking using a dynamic panel 
analysis with a data set for 46 US states from 1963 to 1992 and they estimate the relation -
ship between consumption, prices, income and prices in neighbouring states. They ex -
periment with a range of estimation procedures and instruments to resolve the potential endogeneity problems, including combinations of 2SLS with fixed effects and generalized method of moments.
Their dependent variable is current consumption and they find that the parameters 
on lagged and future consumption are positive and significant. There is less evidence that prices have a significant impact – the impacts vary depending on the estimation technique used. Their estimates of the SRPED range from -0.69 to -0.42 and for LRPED between  131 ratIonal a DD ICtIon  MoDElS
-1.39 to -2.04 though, as BGM found, the discount rate is not sharply estimated which 
undermines the robustness of the results. Whilst they do use a more careful econometric approach than other studies and their results are broadly consistent with other studies, they admit that macroeconomic analyses are vulnerable to significant econometric limita -
tions because of aggregation problems and endogeneity. Microeconomic empirical studies have the potential to deliver more reliable results.
Chaloupka’s microeconomic analysis
Chaloupka’s (1991) analysis is a significant advance on the previous studies because he uses microeconomic data. He assumes rationality by assuming that addicts consider the future consequences of current and past behaviour but allows discount rates will be higher for some groups. One innovation in Chaloupka’s analysis is that he also incorporates a varia -
ble to capture addictive capital stock. He also introduces the concept of ‘Relaxation’ (the psychological and physiological benefits from addiction) reflecting tolerance (when past consumption lowers the marginal utility of current consumption, as in BGM’s model) and reinforcement (when past consumption increases current consumption, also seen in BGM’s model).
His econometric analyses build on microlevel data from the 2nd US National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES) examining responses from 28,000 people from six months to 74 years over the period 1976–1980. As for other studies, he uses instrumental variable estimation to resolve potential endogeneity problems. Chaloupka finds that price impacts are negative and past prices have a greater impact than future price, consistent with rational addiction because the future price parameter incorporates a discount factor. He finds that lagged consumption is usually significant and positive. The findings are mixed so offer no clear lessons about myopia versus forward-looking addiction.
The coefficient on addictive stock is significant and positive, confirming the reinforce -
ment hypothesis. The estimates of the LRPEDs are lower than in Becker et al . for current/
former smokers , and are estimated to be between –0.48 to –0.35. Individual differences 
are significant: the less educated are more price responsive with LRPED estimates between –0.62 and –0.57. More educated smokers are unresponsive to price, as are young adults and the elderly. In middle age (the 25–64-year-olds), LRPEDs range between –0.46 and –0.31.
other studies
There are a number of other studies of addiction which are broadly consistent with BGM’s hypotheses. Lewit and Grossman (1981) and  Lewit and Coate (1982) find that  youths re -
spond more than adults to price changes. Townsend (1987) and Farrell and Fuchs (1982) analyse smoking data to show that information since the 1960s about harmful consequences has had more effect on smoking by the rich/more educated than the poor/less educated.
Olekalns and Bardsley (1996) study caffeine consumption, a habit which is strongly 
addictive but legal so they were easily able to use data on coffee prices. They exploited the fact that the commodity price cycle leads to price fluctuations and argues that this gives a good natural experiment for analysing coffee consumption responses to price changes. Using US Data on per capita caffeine consumption from the US Dept of Agriculture 132 BaD HaB I tS
Economic Research Service, they find positive associations between current consumption 
and past and future consumption consistent with rational addiction. Negative associations were found between current consumption and current prices but positive association between current consumption and past and future prices. The long-run price elasticity is poorly estimated  with the wrong sign, perhaps reflecting the fact that they were working 
with a very small sample. There are a number of econometric problems with their study but their results are broadly consistent with the other econometric studies discussed.
For other addictions, Cook and Tauchen (1982) in a 1962–1977 cross-sectional analy -
sis of alcoholism in US states found that excise taxes lead to significant, negative impacts on cirrhosis deaths. There is also evidence about gambling. Mobilia (1990) conducted an experimental study of gambling at horse-racing tracks between 1950 and 1986. Parallel -
ing the analysis of changes in cigarette prices on smoking, for horse-racing the demand variable is the number of bets per person (that is the “handle” per person ) and the price 
variable is the takeout rate, which is the fraction of the bet retained by the track. Mobilia finds, with results similar to smoking results, that an increase in the takeout rate lowers the future handle per person and estimates a LRPED of −0.7 and SRPED of −0.3, not dis -
similar to the estimates for the smoking studies.
rational addiction models: summary of evidence and implications
The econometric studies explored above, including BGM’s study, show that rational addic -
tion models can be empirically distinguished from myopia by introducing lead variables to capture expectations. This empirical evidence shows that future prices/consumption have an impact on current consumption which supports rational addiction models based on assumptions of forward-looking addicts.
Overall, these studies show that in controlling addiction, money price is more im -
portant to poorer, younger people because they often place smaller value on future costs from health problems and other future harms, reflected in the fact that younger, poorer people have higher discount rates. Addicts with higher discount rates respond more to price changes and so reductions in price will have a substantial positive impact on con -
sumption, particularly amongst the young. It follows that doubling federal excise tax on cigarettes would lead to an increase of 15% in price and therefore a 6% fall in average cigarette consumption.
For hard drug use, there is no direct evidence from the econometric studies above 
but, assuming that patterns are similar, if drugs were legalized then a fall in prices would 
expand use. Within poorer, less educated groups (where discount rates are higher), con -
sumption is more responsive to price so drug addiction amongst the poor is likely to become more significant as prices fall with legislative change . Similarly, addiction would 
become more of a problem amongst younger age groups. Temporary policies won’t work: the effects of “wars” on drugs are limited because only current (not future) prices rise; there will be no complementary fall in current use from a fall in future use. Addicts with lower discount rates respond more to changes in harmful future consequences and ed -
ucation programmes are more likely to be effective with these groups, including richer, older  people.
BGM also outline some industrial policy implications, focusing on monopoly and 
addiction. The cigarette industry is highly concentrated with a large proportion of output  133 ratIonal a DD ICtIon  MoDElS
produced by two firms – British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International and 
so these companies have significant monopoly power. A monopolist can set prices at a point where the marginal revenue is less than the marginal cost and whilst that won’t lead to profit-maximizing in the short term, if consumption is addictive, then increases in current consumption in the short term will lead to increases in future consumption in the long term and then the monopolist can raise future prices to increases future profits. Lower prices get consumers hooked.
Similarly, Gruber and Köszegi (2001) argue that inelastic demand for addictive sub -
stances allows oligopolistic producers to raise prices. Adler and Freedman (1990) note the “magic trick” from production of addictive goods. Cigarette producers are able to increase profits in an industry in which demand is falling rapidly because past and present con -
sumption interact via adjacent complementarity. This habit persistence amongst smokers explains why cigarette companies post big profits despite greater education about negative health consequences.
One overall remaining problem with the econometric analyses of rational addiction 
models, identified by Gruber and Köszegi, is that they cannot empirically distinguish models of addiction with time-consistent versus time-inconsistent preferences when the difference might be important. Does evidence about heterogeneity across demographic groups suggest that the younger/less educated are myopic? have time-inconsistent prefer -
ences? or just higher discount rates? Everyday observation of smokers suggests that their behaviour is time-inconsistent because many people do use quitting aids which would not be consistent with future intentions to smoke. The experimental evidence does not justify assumptions of exponential discounting and time consistency often seen in the econometric analyses. Behavioural experimental techniques including neuroeconomic studies can move beyond these constraints and, as explored in Chapters 11 and 12, can provide a richer understanding of what really propels addictive habits.
Cue-triggered consumption
Cue-triggered consumption models develop from the insight from psychology that re -
sistance to temptation is determined by context and environment. Walter Mischel and colleagues conducted experiments on self-imposed delay of gratification, to test resistance to temptation.
Mischel and Ebbesen (1970) manipulated children’s attention to delayed rewards in a 
number of contexts. They studied 32 preschool children waiting for a preferred but de -
layed reward. They were studied in four settings in which they were in a room with: 1. a delayed reward; 2. a less preferred but immediately available reward; 3. both rewards; or, 4. no rewards. Mischel and Ebeesen found that the amount of time the children were able to wait for the preferred reward before it was forfeited was affected by context. Voluntary waiting time increased substantially when they were outside the presence of the preferred rewards. This finding foreshadows cue-triggered consumption models focusing on the importance of contextual cues.
The study of contextual cues was developed further by Mischel, Ebbesen and Zeiss 
(1972) in the famous marshmallow experiment using a group of 92 three–five-year-olds. They were allowed to eat one marshmallow (or some other treat). Many resisted the temptation to eat the first marshmallow in order to get the second but the most interesting 134 BaD HaB I tS
finding was that they were able to wait longer if they were distracted. On the other hand, 
thinking about the treat and also negative thoughts led to decreases in waiting times. The children used a range of techniques to distract their own attention from the treats, per -
haps as a form of pre-commitment device. Metcalfe and Mischel (1999) postulate that de -
lay of gratification involves interactions between a cool, cognitive “know” system which is slow and strategic; and a hot, emotional “go” system which is impulsive, innate and undermines efforts at self-control. (This approach also links with Kahneman’s [2003] analyses of System 1 and System 2 thinking, as discussed in later chapters.)
laibson’s cue-theory of consumption
Cue-triggered consumption models develop these insights from social learning theory and also incorporate insights from behavioural psychology about the links between stim -
uli, reinforcement and behaviour. Laibson (2001) develops a model of cue-triggered ad -
diction based on psychological analyses of learning and conditioning.
As explained in Chapter 5 , the experimental psychologist Thorndike constructed 
some psychological laws to capture the progress of conditioning. He found that animals made associations between stimuli, actions and rewards and from this devised some laws of conditioning: the law of effect – actions which produce pleasure will be repeated and so behaviour responds to pleasure and reward; the law of exercise – actions are more likely to be used if they produce positive associations and less likely to be used if they produce negative associations; and the law of recency – experiences from recent events will have more salience and so we are more likely to repeat recently learned responses and the impacts of prior rewards and punishments will decay over time.
Laibson (2001) captures some of these conditioning effects in an analysis of cue-
 
tr
iggered consumption and the role of environmental factors in addiction. He describes 
the case of a man with cocaine/heroin dependence who weaned himself off drugs whilst in prison. He was able successfully to resist temptations whilst in prison but, upon his release, he was exposed to environmental cues which reminded him of his drug-addicted state. He was not able to resist those cues and so relapsed.
Cue-based complementarities are created when a cue by itself leads to increases in the 
marginal utility of consumption. Impulsivity plays an important role and, when exposed to immediately available rewards, cues will trigger physiological changes which prime the consumer to consume immediately. Laibson argues that his model provides biological foundations for rational addiction models: the BGM model is a special case of Laibson’s more general cues model, applying when the adjacent complementarity condition holds. Laibson also embeds pre-commitment into his analysis arguing that, in a restricted cues version of his model, people may decide to reduce their set of choices in order to enable cue management.
Bernheim and range l on hot –cold systems
Bernheim and Rangel’s (2004) analysis of addiction was foreshadowed by Metcalfe and Mischel’s (1999) psychological analysis of hot –cool systems, as explained above. Bern -
heim and Rangel (2004) contest Becker and Murphy’s (1988) models of rational addiction and form three main postulates: first, using addictive substances is a mistake; second, individuals are sensitized by exposure and hot states trigger mistaken usage; and third,  135 ratIonal a DD ICtIon  MoDElS
addicts are nonetheless sophisticated and attempt to manage their addictions by using 
pre-commitment devices.
Bernheim and Rangel (2004) identify a number of behavioural patterns which can -
not be explained by rational addiction models. First, addicts often try unsuccessfully to quit their addiction; second, exposure to cues is associated with recidivism; third, when describing their past drugs use addicts often describe it as a mistake; fourth, addicts at -
tempt self-control via pre-commitment and they will voluntarily remove options to con -
sume in the future; and fifth, behavioural and cognitive therapies, partly by teaching cue-
 av
oidance, reduce addictive behaviour. None of these patterns are consistent with an 
assumption of rational addiction.
Cues in natural addiction models
Smith and Tasnádi (2007) use insights from neurobiology to construct a biological model of cue-triggered “natural addiction”. They start with the evolutionary/biological founda -
tions of addiction, for example in foraging for food we have evolved to respond to cues such as sweetness which might convey something about the nutritional value of foods. So cues become satisfying themselves. The problem is that in modern settings, where many foods have unnaturally high sugar content, these cues can lead to destructive, unhealthy behaviours .
Smith and Tasnádi focus on the role of endogenous opio ids in optimal foraging. Rats 
will self-administer morphine to the point of addiction and administration of opiates leads to increased food intake. Smith and Tasnádi explore the biological process: opiate molecules bind with opiate receptors and activate them leading to physiological and be-havioural changes.
In particular, endogenous opioids play a role in influencing perceived palatability. 
When endogenous opioids are released they reinforce the consumption of the food stim -
ulating the dopaminergic pathways. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that triggers re-ward-seeking . It plays a key role in the neurobiology of learning and if consumption of a 
good (e.g. sugar) gives pleasure by stimulating these neurobiological reward structures, then more of that good will be consumed in the future. Endogenous opioids make food taste good and the consumption of sweet foods leads to release of endorphins, produc -
ing similar effects to opioids. In this way, eating sweet things generates a “biochemical cascade” causing us to eat more, irrespective of calorific needs. This also links to drug addictions because heroin and other drugs mimic the effects of these endogenous opi -
oids. Optimal foraging involves responding to environmental cues indicating nutritional value. In nature, very sugary foods occur rarely so in a primitive foraging environment sweetness signals highly nutritious foods. In a modern context, however, sugary foods are a lot more common and human physiology is not adapted to cope with their abundance.
In a modern version of Stigler’s (1945) diet problem (which was about the volume of 
specific foods that would have to be eaten to satisfy a range of nutritional needs), Smith and Tasnádi construct a model of “natural” addiction which involves optimizing for a balanced diet. They postulate two states of the world: a no-cue balanced diet problem when people have to forage for food without specific cues; and a positive-cue balanced diet problem when positive cues are observed which gives clue about concentration of nutrients in an addictive good.136 BaD HaB I tS
A simplified version of Smith and Tasnádi’s model is illustrated in Figure 8.2 –  sh owing 
how consumption is propelled by cues. If a positive cue is received then the consumption 
of the addictive good increases and consumption of other goods will fall. Increments to consumption of an addictive good will generate two effects: an 
ε benefit reflecting the 
subjective  beliefs about the nutritional value of the addictive good –shown by area B; and 
an ε loss reflecting the impact on nutrient intake of a decrease in consumption of rela -
tively nutritious ordinary good – shown by area L. If B>L then the perceived benefits of the addictive good will outweigh the perceived losses and the person will increase their consumption of the addictive substance.
Smith and Tasnádi recognize (and do not dispute) that Bayesian learning generates 
adjacent complementarity: a positive cue in one period increases a person’s judgement of the posterior probability of positive cue in the next period. However, the process of con -
sumption is still not fully rational. Visceral factors, and bodily responses, are important because subjective, psychological factors determine the magnitude of B relative to L. In addition, as explained above, the cues may be misleading if they stimulate the dopamin -
ergic pathways even when potential nutritional value of an addictive substance is limited or non-existent.
Giving-up strategies might harness the learning elements of addiction: quitting “cold 
turkey” may stop the arrival of hedonic “false clues” about benefits of use. On the other hand, uncertainty, incomplete information and time inconsistency suggest a role for pa -
ternalism. Overall, Smith and Tasnádi suggest that conceptions of rationality should rec -
ognize that we are affected by sophisticated biological systems which are adapted to a pre-industrial environment. These systems can be “hijacked” by technological advances and we have not (yet) evolved to cope. They conclude that pleasure and satiety from smoking (and overeating, etc.) is derived from bodily effects and whilst there is a role for habits, bodily urges are an important aspect of addiction. Quitting therapies could be designed accordingly. Sensory replacements such as inhalers and de-nicotinized cigarettes could be made more cheaply and widely available to allow addicts to satisfy their bodily “needs” to smoke.

Visceral factors
Loewenstein (1996) offers an alternative to the rational addiction models by analysing the 
impact of bodily, visceral influences on addiction. He observes that discrepancies between self-interest and behaviour and from knowledge to action leads to feeling “out of control”. This can be attributed to the impact of visceral factors (VFs) which are basic drives and instincts, for example thirst and hunger. VFs are not bad in themselves but self-destructive behaviour reflects the excessive influence of VFs.
Intensity is important in reconciling interactions between cognitive and affective fac -
tors and similarly for VFs: at low levels VFs can be accommodated; at medium levels they can be controlled via effortful self-control; at high levels VFs take over and rational de -
liberation is overridden. For example, if a driver is sufficiently tired then a visceral need to sleep will overwhelm the cognitive processes such as concentration that are engaged during driving, and the driver will fall asleep at the wheel.
Rational choice requires that VFs be taken into account and addiction occurs when 
VFs have excessive influence. It represents the overriding of rational deliberation by VFs. Loewenstein argues that Becker and Murphy’s model does not fit the facts because it doesn’t capture the hedonic aspects of addiction including the downward “hedonic spi -
rals” observed as addictions develop when people fail to notice small incremental negative effects. Addicts don’t use information aside from their personal experience even though it’s widely available.
Addiction is as much about avoiding pain as pursuing pleasure. Pain from habituation 
comes in two forms: pain of withdrawal and cravings from conditioned associations. These are captured by two propositions from Loewenstein’s schema: people underesti -
mate the impact of future VFs and so exaggerate their ability to give up; and future pains seem unreal to the currently pain-free self. Loewenstein concludes that the problems generated by failure to embed VFs and emotions into decision-making paradigms means that the problem has been underestimated. Irrationality as failure to adhere to axioms of choice doesn’t fit with our personal experiences. When VFs are overwhelming , behaviour 
becomes “arational: it is not a conscious decision to do something stupid.
~
Addiction and other bad habits reflect a complex interaction of economic and psychologi -
cal factors. In the rational addiction models of Becker, Grossman and Murphy, addiction is a voluntary choice but does nonetheless generate externalities and other forms of market failure. Rational addiction models do not however rest easily with our intuitions about addiction. The fact that addicts are often very keen to kick their habits suggests that the roots of addiction are more complex that the rational addiction theorists allow. Addiction is more likely to be the product of present bias and lack of self-control, exacerbated by neurobiological factors which increase a person’s susceptibility to visceral cues.
In terms of policy implications, the rational addiction theorists have analysed a 
range of policy implications . Becker, Grossman and Murphy (1994) assert that poorer 
and less educated groups are more responsive to prices and if legalization lowers prices then 
 ad
dictions will get worse, not better. Richer, more educated groups with 
lower discount  rates are  more likely to respond to information campaigns about 138 BaD HaB I tS
future  consequences. Wars on  drugs may lead to temporary price rises but given ex -
pectations of future price falls once the war on drugs is over, policy impacts predicted 
will be limited. Monopolistic tobacco manufacturers should be regulated because they are able to exploit addictive behaviour to increase long-term profits. Gruber and Köszegi explain that optimal taxation should be designed to remove externalities from smoking but if “internalities” are also generated then optimal excise taxes on tobacco should be higher to reflect these internalities.
Bernheim and Rangel suggest a range of policy implications following from their 
analysis of cues and hot –cold systems as described above. They do not advocate limits 
on planned use because this reflects voluntary reasoned choice. Instead, they focus on policies which control the influence of the cue triggers precipitating impulsive consump -
tion, particularly for people in hot, emotionally charged states. Alongside standard policy approaches focusing on reducing externalities and improving information and education about addictive substances, they advocate some more novel policy prescriptions. Uncer -
tainty is a particularly profound problem for addicts because it is impossible to predict environmental cues that might trigger self-destructive behaviour and this generates signif -
icant monetary risks in terms of the financial consequences from random environmental events. Universal insurance policies would reduce these risks. Rehabilitation should be subsidized and distribution should be controlled via prescription. Advertising and market -
ing restrictions alongside controls on public use will reduce the frequency of cues and will help to reduce impulsive use of addictive substances. Counter cues, such as including pho -
tographs of diseased lungs on cigarette packaging or plain packaging, may also be effective.
Another approach is to use tools developed from standard economic approaches 
adapted to take into account some of the behavioural and psychological factors dis -
cussed in this chapter. Loewenstein and Ubel (2010) argue that too much is claimed for behavioural economics and suggest policies that blend insights from the rational addiction theorists with those from the behavioural economists. Behavioural economics might provide some guidance about the need to subsidize unsweetened drinks or tax sugary ones but standard economics will tell us that we need a large price difference between the two.
Different addictions and self-destructive behaviours may need different solutions. 
Taxation may play an important role but social influences may also have a significant influence. Policies such as smoking bans will have positive impacts for a number of rea -
sons, not only because they reduce the incidence of passive smoking and reduce the cues that might trigger a relapse in an ex-smoker but also because smoking is removed from a social context facilitating the evolution of a new non-smoking social norm. Overall, if we can develop a deeper understanding of the complex roots and causes of self-destructive behaviours then this will enable governments more effectively to tailor policies to the particular features of specific addictions.
Chapter summary
 •Addiction is explained in rational choice theory as the balancing of utility from con-suming addictive substances, for example nicotine, over time – as set out by econo -
mist Gary Becker and colleagues. 139 a8.1 Mat HE MatIC S oF r atIon al a DD ICtIon MoDEl
 •In behavioural economics, addiction and bad habits can be explained in terms of time 
inconsistency and creates internalities  – that is consequences for a person’s future self 
that the person’s “future self” did not choose, as well as externalities in terms of neg -
ative impacts on others who did not choose the action – for example, passive smoking.
 •Behavioural economics can provide a richer explanation for addiction and other bad habits by allowing that people are driven by emotional and affective factors associated with lack of self-control.
 •Decision-makers can deal with their self-control problems via pre-commitment strat -
egies in which they bind their current self to achieve future goals – for example via quitting aids to give up smoking.
 •Smith and Tasnádi draw on insights from evolutionary neuroscience to explain why and how addictive habits have particular power in a modern context.
 •The empirical evidence from economic models of addiction is mixed and more work is needed especially in constructing models that can inform the policy challenges around addressing problems of addiction and bad habits.

athematics of Becker, gr
ossman and 
Murphy’s rational addiction model
Becker, Grossman and Murphy (BGM) assume that consumers are rational, forward-  
lo
oking with time-consistent preferences. In the rational addiction model, addiction is 
not myopic.
Dynamics of stock of addictive capital
Past consumption of an addictive substance (c) and life-cycle events will build up the 
stock of addictive capital (S), which will evolve as follows:
Stc tS tδ () () ()=−
In steady state S will be stable and the steady state condition is ctS tδ () ()= .140 BaD HaB I tS
Addicts need to consume more of an addictive substance as consumption increases 
and this is associated with tolerance and reinforcement.
tolerance
Tolerance reflects the fact that past consumption lowers current and future utility and so 
current utility decreases as the stock of addictive capital increases:
us us ∂∂= < /0
reinforcement
With reinforcement, increases in past consumption lead to an increase in the stock of addictive capital stock and this raises present consumption:
cs∂∂>/0
adjacent complementarity
With adjacent complementarity, past (current) consumption is reinforcing and leads to greater current (future) consumption . The necessary and sufficient condition for rein -
forcement near steady state is:
uucs ss σδ()+> − 2
where σ is the rate of time preference and δ is the rate of depreciation in S , where

When the adjacent complementarity condition holds, reinforcement (as captured by the discounted, depreciated marginal utility of consumption with respect to increments to the stock of addictive capital) will dominate tolerance and past consumption will be asso -
ciated with increases in future consumption. Chapter 9
Personality, moods and emotions
Personality, moods, emotions and visceral factors play a crucial role in our everyday 
 de
cision-making, a facet of behaviour that modern economists have been slow to explore. 
Exploring these subjective socio-psychological influences on behaviour enriches behav -
ioural economists’ understanding of economic and financial decision-making. Embedding 
these influences also offers a stark alternative to orthodox models of  de
cision-making, 
which  – as we have seen in previous chapters – are grounded in rational choice  th
eory. 
 Ra
tional choice theories in standard economic models assume homogenous, self-  
in
terested individuals using logical methods to make their choices. A representative agent 
captures the average behaviour of everyone and there is no obvious role for psychological 
 fa
ctors. Many models in behavioural economics reflect this approach to some extent and 
the analyses in previous chapters, whilst admitting that subjectivity and behavioural bias have important impacts on beliefs and expectations, have generally focused on observ -
able influences and choices, usually in an experimental context. Therefore, individual differences and largely unobservable phenomena such as moods and emotions have been assumed away.
This chapter deepens the analysis by exploring the impacts on economic behaviour of 
heterogeneity and individual differences including demographic characteristics, person -
ality traits and cognitive/non-cognitive skills. Personality will have an impact on emo -
tions because it determines an individual’s predispositions; for example, a person with an optimistic personality will be more inclined to feel cheerful. Emotions, mood and decision-making are intertwined in the economic and financial world but, until recently, emotions have been neglected in economic analysis. As well as moods and emotions, decision-making will also be affected by visceral factors which include basic drives and urges. This chapter also outlines a range of ways in which moods, emotions and visceral factors can be incorporated into economic analysis.
In understanding how personality, moods and emotions influence economic and fi -
nancial decision-making, insights from psychology provide an important starting point. Some parts of psychology share a lot in common with economics – most obviously behavioural psychology. Behavioural psychology focuses on objective information such 142 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
as observed choice, for example from experimental trials. Partly it was developed as 
an alternative to older sub-disciplines in psychology that had focused on less easily measurable variables, including personality. More recently however, the importance of personality is being recognized because individual differences in levels of generosity can explain differing degrees of sociality; impulsivity can explain impatience and time inconsistency.
lessons from psychology: personality theory
Starting with personality: psychologists’ theories of personality analyse characteristics of individual that lead to consistent patterns of behaviour and as economists are generally interested in trying to explain consistent (or inconsistent) choices, personality theory has a number of insights to offer.
Freud’s psychoanalytic theory
One of the pioneering approaches to analysing personality and traits was Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory. In Freud’s approach, behaviour is the outcome of interplays be -
tween basic drives, needs and conflicts (Pervin 1984). Freud analysed a very wide range of forces affecting personality, including different levels of consciousness including con -
scious, preconscious and unconscious thought (Freud 1899). In modern behavioural eco -
nomics, there is focus on automatic versus deliberative processing, and this mirrors the Freudian distinctions of conscious, preconscious and unconscious thought. Freud identi -
fied roles for different aspects of personality and the principles driving behaviour – the interactions between the pleasure principle and the reality principle and the roles played by different elements of personality. The id is driven by the pleasure principle impulsively to seek gratification of basic instincts. The ego is driven by the reality principle to delay gratification in a rational, practical way. The superego is the rigid, sometimes judgemental moral compass that guides ethical attitudes. According to Freud, childhood development proceeds as the child’s ego learns to delay gratification (Freud 1921, 1949). Nonetheless, the ego plays a subordinate role in the sense that it is a victim not only of the compet -
ing pressures from the id and superego but also of reality. As economists are interested in consistent choices, the personality traits that propel those choices can illuminate our understanding of economic behaviour. Freud analysed identification – the process via which we integrate the characteristics of others into our personality. Freud thought that 
identification with a same-sex parent develops during the phallic phase and other forms of identification include narcissistic identification – identifying yourself with similar people; goal-oriented identification – identification with successful people; object-loss 
 id
entification – identifying with lost objects and people; and aggressor identification – 
identifying with authority figures (Pervin 1984).
Although, for some, Freud’s theories are discredited as scientific theories because 
there is no objective evidence to support them, Freudian themes can still be found in modern behavioural economics – for example, Nobel-Prize winning economist George Akerlof explores a number of Freudian themes in his analyses of cognitive dissonance, il -
lusion and identity. Some Freudian themes resonate with new insights from neuroscience, as we will see in Chapters 11 and 12. 143 lESS onS FroM P SYCH o log Y: P ErSon alItY tHEorY
Jung’s archetypes
Carl Jung developed a psychoanalytic approach grounded in the analysis of individual 
psyches. Whilst he split intellectually from  Freud, his approach was grounded in tools and 
approaches from psychoanalysis, focusing on unconscious, sometimes irrational drives as well as conscious, rational thoughts with layers of personality comprising the conscious, the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. He developed Plato’s concept of archetypes  – universal symbols resting in the collective unconscious and envisaged these 
as elements of our personalities, for example “Mother” – the nurturing part; “anima” – the feminine part; “animus” – the masculine part. The archetypes rest in the collective unconscious and are universal and so are seen throughout history in culture, folk tales and literature (Jung 1991). Jung also identified different psychological types reflecting attitudes (extraversion versus introversion), perceptions (intuition versus sensing) and judgements (thinking versus feeling) and his analysis of personality types was the foun -
dation of the Myers-Brigg Type Indicator (MBTI) developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, as explained below (Jung 1923; Grigorenko and Sternberg 1995).
Modern personality theory
More recently, theories of personality have concentrated on the analysis of personality traits. George Kelly (1955) developed the construct theory of personality, which is built upon the analysis of the bipolar constructs (e.g. good vs. bad) which enable us to catego -
rize people and events to interpret and make sense of the world around us by understand -
ing their similarities and differences, thus generating a structure into which we fit our experiences. Kelly identified a range of constructs from essential core constructs through to peripheral, inessential constructs. This interpretation of the world is inherently subjec -
tive and Kelly identified the problem that our understanding of the world is shaped by the way in which we construct our understanding of it, and this foreshadows recent analyses of personality in economics, including Borghans et al.  (2008). It also links to the framing 
effects and context dependence identified by Kahneman and Tversky and others.
Gordon Allport’s trait theory analysed the impact of traits on habitual thought pat -
terns, both cognitive and emotional. Allport observed that traits are relatively stable for the individual but variable across individuals. He saw personality traits as unifying fea -
tures and divided traits into various categories. Central traits are essential to an individual . 
 Se
condary traits are seen just in certain circumstances and contexts . Cardinal traits  are the 
traits that define individuals and make them distinctive; and common traits, which are specific to particular social and cultural contexts (Allport 1937). Allport asserted that all these  traits are interconnected and important to the formation of identity (Allport  1955) .
Measuring cognitive skills
Individual differences link to cognitive capacity and there is a wide range of ways to capture how individual differences affect cognitive functioning and intelligence. Intelli -
gence can be defined as the ability to solve problems and this gives some objectivity to the concept. Nonetheless, difficulties in measurement will emerge because intelligence is not a monolithic characteristic. Early tests of cognitive skills were developed by Alfred Binet, Théodore Simon and William Stern who devised the intelligence quotient (IQ) test. Early 144 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
IQ tests tended to focus on intelligence – one, overarching characteristic. More recently, 
general intelligence has been characterized as reflecting a hierarchy of cognitive skills. Two of the major factors underlying general intelligence include fluid intelligence  – the 
ability to think laterally and problem-solve, and crystallized intelligence gained from learning and experience (Cattell 1971). Someone with high levels of crystallized intel -
ligence may perform less well in certain tasks than someone with high levels of fluid intelligence and vice versa.
It is important to note that measuring cognitive skills cannot be completely objec -
tive. Performance can be determined by factors not related to cognitive functioning, for example performance in IQ tests is dependent not only on cultural factors and linguistic difference but also on incentives and non-cognitive skills such as conscientiousness and motivation (Borghans et al.  2008). Intelligence can also be difficult to define because it has 
many facets.
Personality tests
Capturing non-cognitive skills and personality traits is even more complicated than meas -
uring cognitive skills. It is difficult to establish an objective basis for individual differences in personality. Kelly developed an early personality test in the form of the Role Construct Repertory Test (Rep Test). This test drew on some features from Jung’s insights and subjects were asked to list key figures (e.g. mother, father, teacher) and make connections between them on the basis of similarities and contrasts. The Rep Test is no longer widely used but a number of personality theories and tests have evolved since including Gordon Allport’s (1961) trait theory, and personality tests evolving from Hans Eysenck’s analyses of traits.
More recently, tests have evolved that focus on a single or small number of traits, for 
example Barratt’s impulsivity scale, the Baron-Cohen-Wheelwright empathy quotient and Hans Eysenck’s multifactor personality tests of impulsiveness, empathy, conformity and psychoticism (Eysenck 1967, 1975, 1991; Eysenck and Eysenck 1975, 1976, 1978). Some tests are commonly used today including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), men -
tioned above, and the Big Five personality test.
Myers-Briggs type  Indicator (MB tI)
In order to capture the insights of the personality theorists in real, clinical contexts, a number of personality testing methods developed. Jung’s structure, as described above, inspired the Myers-Briggs approach to capturing personality styles, where the styles reflect a person’s interaction with their environment. The MBTI captures aspects of conscious mental activity according to the following features: introversion versus extroversion; in -
tuition versus sensing; thinking versus feeling; and judging versus perceiving, giving 16 types of personality styles. The MBTI taxonomy is similar to Jung’s structure, though My -
ers is more tightly organized (Myers 1981; Grigorenko and Sternberg 1995).
Big Five theory
Another method of personality testing often used in economic analyses, for example Heckman’s analysis of personality and the life cycle, is the Big Five personality test. These tests were developed originally by Tupes and Christal (1961) and subsequently by McCrae  145 PErSonal ItY an D InDI VIDU al  D IFFE rEnCE S
and Costa (1987, 1989) and Costa and McCrae (1992, 2005). The Big Five captures aspects 
of personality along five dimensions, given the acronym OCEAN, capturing five dimen -
sions linked to five broad, higher-level traits of Openness to experience, Conscientious -
ness (versus ‘undirectedness’), Extraversion (versus introversion), Agreeableness (versus antagonism) and Neuroticism (versus emotional stability). This taxonomy is used either in self-report questionnaires or in peer ratings of a person’s personality. The five dimen -
sions, assessed according to polar adjectives, reflect Kelly’s bipolar constructs, as described by McCrae and Costa (1987). For example, Openness is captured by dimensions such as simple–complex, conforming–independent, unanalytical–analytical. Similarly, Con -
scientiousness is captured by adjectives including lazy–hardworking, stupid–
 int
elligent, 
unfair–fair; Extraversion by timid–bold, retiring–sociable, inhibited–spontaneous; Agreeableness by ruthless–softhearted, critical–lenient, callous–sympathetic; and Neu -
roticism by unemotional–emotional, patient–impatient, objective–subjective (McCrae and Costa  1987).
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory  
a
nd the ror
schach test
Some personality tests have been designed specifically to capture psychopathologies and the one that is commonly used by mental health professionals is the Minnesota Mul -
tiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) originally devised by Hathaway and Kinley (1943). Modern versions of the test incorporate a wide range of test items which capture the thoughts, feelings and behaviours of the subjects. Interpreting the answers can be prob -
lematic because it is not possible to establish whether respondents are being truthful, or reading the questions properly so additional items are included to capture the validity of answers, for example a “lie” scale designed to judge how honest the respondent is. Also, the focus is not on the individual scores on specific test items but instead on the whole personality profile constructed when collections of items are interpreted as a whole.
Overall, the tests used specifically by mental health professionals are designed to en -
able assessment of psychopathologies so might be less relevant to economists who are interested in the behaviour of “normal” experimental participants. Nonetheless, insights from tests traditionally used by mental health practitioners may have some value. For example, there has been a revival of interest in the Rorschach “ink blot” test amongst be -
havioural economists. These tests assess experimental participants’ responses to random inkblot patterns – because some aspects of this test correlate with intellect and cognitive functioning (Meyer et al.  2011).
Personality and individual differences
Personality can be defined as “patterns of thought, feelings and behaviour” (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman and Ter Weel 2008). Personality can affect economic 
 de
cision-making in a number of ways. Some personality traits affect cognitive func -
tioning via their impact on cognitive skills. Personality traits may also be associated with standard economic preference parameters including time preference, social pref -
erences, risk aversion and preferences for leisure. For example, personality will be a de -
terminant of a person’s rate of time preference and so will have an impact on life-cycle 146 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
choices such as savings: a conscientious person is inclined to be more patient, for ex -
ample, and so is more likely to save for the future and/or invest in their own human 
capital. Personality traits also determine emotional predispositions and so are a crucial link between emotion and behaviour: if an impulsive person is more likely to feel anger quickly then they are also more likely to act aggressively. The links between per -
sonality, cognitive/non-cognitive skills and preference parameters is explored below and the relationship between personality, predispositions and emotions is explored in Chapter 9 .
Introducing personality traits into economic analysis is complicated by the difficul -
ties in clearly defining personality traits in economic terms. If personality traits are con -
straints then standard economic preference parameters can be conceived as the product of those constraints. They can also be described as goods and/or inputs and Borghans et al.  
analyse the public good and private good aspects of traits. Some traits may be excludable and rivalrous and if more of a trait is devoted to one task then this means that there may be less available for another. A person may devote their conscientiousness to their work and so will be less able to be conscientious about their social life, for example.
There is substantial empirical evidence that individual differences and personality 
traits predict socio-economic outcomes including academic achievement and job per -
formance. Borghans et al.  (2008) present a comprehensive analysis of the economics and 
psychology of personality traits and individual differences using the Big Five model to capture personality traits. The Big Five trait of conscientiousness, perhaps because it links to self-control and perseverance, is a good predictor of academic achievement and also many other aspects of socio-economic performance including years of education, job performance, leadership and longevity (Borghans et al.  2008).
The concept of comparative advantage can be applied to personality traits in the work -
place. Individuals differ in their capacities and this may reflect the role of specific traits. Some traits including trustworthiness, perseverance and extraversion are generally val -
uable in the workplace (Osborne, Gintis and Bowles 2001). Technological changes have increased the importance of social skills and these will be affected by personality traits and individual differences (Borghans, ter Weel and Weinberg 2006). The value of specific characteristics will vary across tasks and occupations and some personality traits will be more important to specific jobs, for example extraversion is a desirable trait for a salesper -
son (Borghans et al.  2008).
These differences will affect job matching too. Dohmen and Falk (2011) use the Big 
Five model to assess the impact of individual differences on worker self-selection. Using lab experiments, they assess the impacts of different incentive schemes including piece rate, revenue sharing and tournament schemes. They find that the different incentives attract different personality types with gender, social preferences and risk preferences also playing a role.
Statistical problems such as endogeneity, reverse causality and measurement error 
will affect econometric estimations incorporating personality. Measured traits will be imperfect proxies for actual traits. It will be difficult to untangle cause and effect. Meas -
urement errors will emerge because of the subjectivity involved when personality assess -
ment is based on the observations and judgements of others. An additional problem is self-report bias, reflecting deception, overconfidence and/or lack of self-insight in tests involving self-assessment (Borghans et al.  2008). 147 PErSonal ItY an D MotIVatIon
Personality and economic preference parameters
There are a number of potential links between personality traits and economic prefer -
ence parameters. Personality traits such as empathy will affect social preferences such as 
altruism, for example. Experimental evidence using Eysenck’s personality tests shows that psychological traits associated with sociability including conformity and extraversion, along with personality traits associated with time preference including impulsivity and venturesomeness, will interact to affect subjects’ susceptibility to social influence in fi -
nancial decision-making (Baddeley et al.  2007). Dohmen, Falk, Huffman and Sunde (2008) 
analyse the links between trust, reciprocity and the Big Five. Personality will also affect risk attitudes, time preference (as seen in Chapter 7) and preferences for leisure.
Dohmen and Falk (2011) analyse the relationships between risk aversion, ambiguity 
aversion, cognitive skills and personality traits and find that higher IQ is associated with more risk tolerance (see also Dohmen et al.  2007). Gender may also play a role and some 
studies show that women are more risk-averse and less ambiguity-averse (Barsky et al.  
1997). Measured risk tolerance is positively related to risky behaviours, including smok -
ing, drinking, failing to have insurance, and holding stocks rather than Treasury bills. These relationships are both statistically and quantitatively significant, although measured risk tolerance does not capture a large proportion of the variance in behaviour.
Personality and motivation
In Chapter 2, we explored some of the behavioural drivers and constraints affecting mo -
tivation; some of these will be moderated by personality traits and individual differences are key determinants of motivation. Some psychological analyses have explored the role of cognitive functioning over the life cycle. Walter Mischel and colleagues rejected the view that personality traits are  always stable and consistent and found that behaviour was 
dependent on situational cues. In a series of studies, they demonstrated that self-control correlates with individual differences and better cognitive functioning leads to better life chances in adulthood.
Children’s behaviour in a residential camp setting was observed in one study and the 
situation–behaviour profiles of the children were analysed. The stability of these profiles varied across individuals, for example levels of aggression varied depending on whether a child was approached by a peer versus an adult; one child would be more aggressive in response to an approach from a peer; the other might be more aggressive in response to an approach from an adult. Behavioural differences were attributed to the different ex -
tents to which individuals could access cognitive-affective mediating units, for example competencies, beliefs, goals; over time, experience leads to the development of situation–behaviour relations reflecting dispositions and cognitive-affective processing so cognition and emotion affect social information processing in different ways in different people (Mischel and Shoda 1995).
Mischel and his colleagues are famous for the “marshmallow experiment” to test 
self-imposed delay of gratification in children: nursery school children were shown sets of two treats (e.g. marshmallows); they waited with one treat and were told that if they managed to resist the temptation to eat that one treat then they would get both at the end of some predetermined period (Mischel, and Ebbesen 1970; Mischel, Ebbeson and Zeiss 1972). The same children were studied at 14 years old; those who had shown more 148 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
evidence of self-control in early childhood had better emotional and cognitive function -
ing and, later in life, were more socially and academically competent than those who had 
exerted less self-control in the early tests (Mischel et al.  1989). Results from Mischel and 
his team, link to the behavioural economics literatures on present bias and self-control, including implications for future well-being, reflecting Mischel’s finding that behaviour in early childhood correlates with future performance.
Personality and cognition
The interplay between personality and cognition has an impact on a range of socio-  
ec
onomic phenomena including wages, education, crime and longevity. Borghans et al. 
(2008) define cognition as the use of thought to overcome obstacles. It is determined by a person’s ability to understand, adapt and learn. There are different aspects to cog -
nition and different ways of measuring it but it is important to allow for the impact of personality traits on cognition, particularly “quasi-cognitive” traits including emotional intelligence.
Common tests of cognitive ability, including IQ tests, do not capture maximum po -
tential intellectual performance. Cognition is enabled by reflection and impulsivity will lower performance in tests of cognitive reflection (Frederick 2005). Performance incen -
tives are important too and Borghans et al.  (2008) cite studies showing that performance 
on IQ tests increases when people are offered incentives including money or candy. These findings can be attributed to the impact of personality traits on a person’s response to incentives: cognitive test performance reflects interplay of intellectual ability and person -
ality traits. This is because IQ tests require effort and so poor performance may reflect a lack of motivation as much as a lack of ability. Anxiety may also affect performance and so a person with a high neuroticism score may do less well because of that aspect of their personality and not because of lower intelligence. In terms of the impact of incentives on cognitive test performance, these will increase motivation for some personalities but those with high emotional stability and conscientiousness are less likely to be affected by external incentives.
Moods and emotions
Mood and emotion are considered as separate phenomena because there are crucial dif -
ferences between them. In some ways, mood can be understood within a standard ap -
proach because sometimes it can affect all people equally, for example if mood is affected by weather. Individual differences do not necessarily complicate the analysis of moods. Be -
havioural economists and economic psychologists distinguish mood from emotions. Elster (1996, 1998) describes emotions as having “an intentional object or target” whereas moods are more diffuse in character: they are “undifferentiated and untargeted states of content -
ment or discontentment”. Moods are more general phenomena, often experienced collec -
tively, in which case they will be unaffected by differences in personality and predisposition.
Elster (1996, 1998) explains that whilst there is no single feature that distinguishes 
moods from emotions, most emotions do have the following features: they are formed on the basis of cognitive antecedents and beliefs, they involve intentional objects and are associated with physiological arousal and expression. They have valence – that is they  149 Moo DS a n D E MotIonS
may be positive or negative. Psychologists make a distinction between emotions and af -
fect. Emotions are biological, innate and instinctive responses to stimuli and involve the 
recall and cognitive processing of affect. Affect is the experience of feeling  an emotion. 
Elster (1996, 1998) also distinguishes emotions and visceral factors with the former being triggered by beliefs and the latter reflecting basic drives and instincts. However, visceral factors are biological, innate and instinctive. Incorporating an evolutionary perspective, visceral factors reflect basic, primitive responses. Emotions, especially social emotions, are more highly evolved.
Psychologists tend to focus on “action tendencies”. In focusing on these tendencies to 
act they identify the cause  of emotions rather than the impact of emotions on behaviour 
(Elster 1998). Generally positive emotions are passively undergone and not chosen though negative emotions can be blocked or the situations which cause them can be avoided. This reflects a distinction between “occurrent emotions” – emotions which occur in a particular situation and “emotional dispositions”: for example, the occurrent emotion of anger is more likely if a person has an irascible predisposition. The occurrent emotion can be avoided, assuming a person has some insight into their own irascibility, if a person can avoid situations which might trigger an angry response. Some of these features are difficult to establish empirically but physiological responses can be measured during eco -
nomic experiments, for example Smith and Dickhaut (2005) use heart rate data to infer emotional states in auction experiments.
Elster (1996) argues that emotions do not necessarily interfere with rationality. Emo -
tions may be important “tie-breakers” when outcomes are indeterminate and reason is an insufficient guide to decision-making. Emotion “serves as a functional equivalent for the rational faculties it suspends” (Elster 1998, p. 60). Visceral factors and emotions are often very efficient because they can operate quickly and with minimal cognitive intervention but people may nonetheless underestimate their influence leading to self-destructive be -
haviours such as addiction (Le Doux 1996; Loewenstein 1996, 2000), an issue which is addressed in Loewenstein’s analysis of visceral factors and also in some analyses of addic -
tion (see Chapter 8 ).
Emotions and incentives
Building on some of the insights around incentives and motivations, which we explored in Chapter 2, some experimental analyses have focused on how incentives are affected by emotional factors – specifically how emotions affect performance. For example, Ariely et al. (2009b) postulate that generous incentive schemes can have unintended emotional 
impacts. Too much arousal can impair performance. Generous incentives may shift atten -
tion from automatic to controlled systems, for example people tend to play sports better if they are not thinking too hard about their movements. Increased incentives also narrow people’s focus and dampen creativity. Drawing on these insights from psychology, Ariely et al. (2009b) postulate that generous payments can lead to “choking under pressure”. They 
conducted a set of experiments in the USA and in India. Subjects worked on different tasks and received performance-contingent payments varying in amount from small to very large relative to their typical levels of pay. One set of experiments was conducted in Indian villages and the villagers performed a series of cognitive tasks involving memory, creativity and motor skills. The villagers were sorted into three incentive conditions: one 150 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
group was offered small incentives of up to 4 rupees (Rs); another moderate payment 
group received up to 40 Rs; the high payment group received up to 400 Rs. As 400 Rs is the average monthly wage, the latter group was playing for a significant sum of money.
Within each condition, good performance was rewarded with a relatively high level 
of reward: very good performance led to high rewards; good performance to substantial reward and average performance gained no reward at all. Ariely et al.  identified a per -
verse impact from large incentives: higher rewards adversely affected performance. In terms of the shares of average earnings relative to maximum earnings for each treatment group, these were 35.4% in the lowest group; 36.7% in the medium group and 19.5% in the highest payment group. They attributed this to choking under pressure and identify similar results from US studies. With some important exceptions, very high reward levels had a detrimental effect on performance, perhaps because emotional responses to gener -
ous rewards lead to choking under pressure, perhaps reflecting conflicts between affect and cognition.
Emotions and heuristics
Emotions and affect may also have an indirect impact via availability heuristics: emo -
tions are more available than objective facts and figures because they are often highly salient, vivid and easily recalled. Emotional factors can dominate cognition especially as it is associated with quicker, more automatic responses. Emotions and affect influence 
 de
cision-making directly via the affect heuristic .
Affect is the experience of feeling an emotion and will have an impact on 
 de
cision-making via the affect heuristic in which emotions are used to guide 
decision-  ma
king. Sometimes, as Antonio Damasio explains in the context of his so -
matic marker hypothesis, emotions can be a reliable guide. At other times, emotions can lead to 
 si
gnificant biases if they distort objective perceptions. Emotions and affect 
may also have an indirect impact via availability heuristics: emotions are more avail -
able than objective facts and figures because they are often highly salient, vivid and easily recalled.
Finucane , Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson (2000) observe that the affect heuristic can 
distort judgements of probability and risk: when people are feeling optimistic about a situation, this will lead to misplaced perceptions of lower risk and larger benefits. For example, emotional responses from the public to journalistic accounts of murder arrests can lead to significant injustices when people’s emotional responses interact with a mis -
application of heuristics including the representativeness heuristic. For example, journal -
ists’ treatment of Christopher Jefferies during the hunt for the murderer of Jo Yeates in 2010: in disseminating emotionally charged opinions about someone’s guilt, journalists sometimes describe traits that are associated with the stereotype of a murderer rather than objective facts.
Emotional salience also affects retrievability and availability. It will also interact with 
the attention bias outlined above. Someone watching a car crash scene will draw on these emotionally salient images, affecting their perception: they will judge it more likely that they will be involved in a car crash even though objective information about the fre -
quency of car crashes has not changed. Similarly, headline news of airplane crashes will be brought to mind more readily than bike accidents because of vivid reports from air crash sites, even though bike accidents are far more frequent. 151 Moo DS a n D E MotIonS
So, whilst availability enables quick decision-making it will lead to biases if the prom -
inence of recent events does not reflect the actual frequency with which events usually 
occur, especially if the events are associated with vivid emotional cues.
Emotional responses impact on other heuristics too. When people are in a happy 
mood they are more likely to use heuristics associated with top-down processing, relying on pre-existing knowledge with little attention to precise details. By contrast, people in a sad mood are more likely to use bottom-up processing heuristics, paying more attention to precise details than existing knowledge (Schwarz 2000, p. 434). Minsky (1997, p. 519) analyses some of the emotional constraints in the case of expert knowledge, arguing that the “negative knowledge” associated with some emotional states may inhibit whole strat -
egies of expert thought.
the somatic marker hypothesis (SMH)
Emotions provide important physiological cues that can help decision-making. Dama -
sio’s early study focuses on the fact that damage to emotional processing circuits impairs people’s ability to make wise financial decisions, for example brain lesions associated with damage to emotional processing lead to constraints on rational behaviour (see also Bechara and Damasio 2005). As we explored above, the affect heuristic involves using emotions to guide decision-making. This can lead to bias because emotions may distort objective judgements. For example, hopefulness can lead people to underestimate risks and overestimate benefits and despondency can lead them to overestimate risk and un -
derestimate benefits (Finucane , Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson 2000). Emotions are also 
very vivid and salient and so can have a disproportionate impact, for example if people have witnessed horrific car crashes then that will affect their perceptions of the risk of driving a car.
Damasio (2006) developed the somatic marker hypothesis to capture the impact of 
emotions on decisions. Damasio (1994, 2006) extends the role of emotions well beyond the affect heuristic. He postulates that emotions and affect are integral to all decisions and not just to decisions in emotionally charged contexts. In the interplay of cognition and emotion, affect gives important physiological cues enabling efficient thinking. These cues are based on somatic markers – the bodily signals we perceive as affect/emotion, provide important guides to action complementing rational action. Somatic markers may be the outcome of conscious thought – for example the gut feel of entrepreneurs represents con -
scious feelings about choices and plans. Knowledge communicated via emotions, either explicitly or implicitly, enables people to make fast and efficient decisions (Damasio 2006; Bechara and Damasio 2005).
In developing the SMH, Damasio and his colleagues focus their research on patients 
with brain damage and they find that damage to specific neural areas usually associated with emotional processing can adversely affect decision-making. The most famous lesion patient study was of Phineas Gage, a railroad manager who suffered a non-fatal accident in 1848 when an iron rod was pushed through his brain. A famous image of the impact was drawn by Phineas Gage’s physician – Dr John M. Harlow in 1868 – as depicted in Figure  9.1. It shows an iron rod passing above the left eye and up through the top of the 
head, probably damaging the frontal lobe on both sides.
Whilst Phineas Gage initially seemed to be largely unaffected by his accident and he 
recovered relatively quickly, people soon noticed significant changes in his behaviour. 152 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
Previously, he’d been responsible, hard-working and sensible. After the accident he be -
came impulsive and unreliable, and he soon lost his job. His changed behaviour has been 
attributed to the damage caused to his frontal lobes, areas associated with cognitive pro -
cessing (Harlow 1868; Ratiu et al.  2004).
Damasio (2006) describes a range of similar lesion patient cases from modern times, 
for which records are more accurate and objective than the records from Phineas Gage’s case. One example is Damasio’s own patient Elliot who had suffered damage to the frontal lobes after an operation to remove a brain tumour. As a consequence, Elliot suffered a reduction of affect and emotion and whilst tests showed that he retained a wide range of cognitive functions these did not enable him to make wiser or more judicious decisions. Instead, he became obsessed with the details of specific tasks, hampering his ability to 
Figure 9.1   Phineas Gage’s injury 153 Moo DS a n D E MotIonS
manage his job. Damasio observes that the reductions in his ability to process emotions 
made Elliott unable to differentiate between different options: “his decision-making landscape [was] hopelessly flat … cold-bloodedness made his mental landscape too shifty and unsustained for the time required to make response selections”.
Adolphs et al. (1995) find similar absence of affect in patients suffering amygdala 
damage. They analysed the behaviour of a group of 18 lesion patients and seven normal patients. For the subjects with brain lesions: six had suffered amygdala damage and the remaining 12 with brain damage to other areas were used as experimental controls along -
side the seven normal subjects. Adolphs et al.  asked their experimental subjects to judge 
facial expressions from a series of black and white slides; for example, they were shown a face and asked “how happy does this person look?” They found small differences between the controls and the subjects with unilateral amygdala damage but one particular patient (Subject SM-046) had suffered severe bilateral lesion damage as the result of the genetic Urbach-Wiethe disease leading to bilateral calcification and atrophy of her amygdala. SM-046’s ratings for “afraid” faces were significantly lower than the ratings from the other subjects. When asked about her responses to the fearful faces she said that she was aware that an emotion was being expressed but was unsure what that emotion was.
The subjects were also asked to draw representations of various emotional states, 
including fear. The patients with unilateral amygdala damage, whilst experiencing dif -
ficulty relative to the control subjects, were able to represent fear, anger and disgust. For patient SM-046, most of her drawings were skillful and effective representations of the various emotions but she represented fear as a crawling baby. In explaining her responses, she explained that “she did not know what an afraid face would look like”. Adolphs et al.  
conclude that the amygdala plays a key role in processing emotions, particularly fear, and this may impair social decision-making. Subject SM-046 also experienced some difficul -
ties with social decision-making confirming findings from other studies showing that the amygdala is activated during social interactions. The amygdala may play a role in inter -
preting social cues and/or processing fear of social sanctions.
loewenstein’s visceral factor model
The emphasis in the SMH on emotions as bodily cues links into analyses of visceral fac -
tors reflecting basic instincts though the visceral factors (VFs) that were introduced in 
 C
hapter 8 . VFs play a less constructive role than emotions. VFs can propel individuals 
towards acting in ways which are contrary to their own self-interest but Elster (1996) emphasizes that VFs are a-rational because they are not the outcome of choice and they can operate efficiently at low levels of cognitive intervention.
Loewenstein (2000) develops a visceral factor model and his main premises are that 
visceral factors crowd out all other goals and people underweight or ignore their own past/future VFs as well as other people’s VFs. VFs have direct hedonic impacts even when actual consumption is unchanging so they resemble consumption, not tastes, and also often generate an aversive experience (e.g. fear, pain). Changes in VFs correlate predictably with external circumstances and do not reflect a permanent change in people’s disposi -
tions. VFs change more rapidly than tastes because tastes are much more stable in the short run. Tastes and VFs draw on different neurophysiological mechanisms: VFs are associated with stable steady states and homeostasis whereas tastes draw on memory and experience.154 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
Loewenstein develops his model to put forward seven main propositions:
1. Discrepancies between actual versus desired rewards from consuming a particular 
good increase with the intensity of the VFs immediately relevant to the consump -
tion of this good.
2. Future  VFs produce little discrepancy between the value we plan to place on a good 
and its desirable value.
3. Increasing VFs, by creating vividness, for example, increase the rewards from im -
mediate consumption relative to delayed consumption.
4. Current VFs will have a mild effect on future decisions.
5. People underestimate impact of VFs on their future behaviour.
6. People forget the influence of past VFs and so may be perplexed by past behaviours driven by VFs.
7. Drawing a parallel between interpersonal and intrapersonal interactions: VFs affect interpersonal (self versus others) and intrapersonal comparisons (current self versus delayed self) in the same ways. We are more short-sighted and selfish when VFs take hold, for example:
a. We are less altruistic when VFs are intense.
b. When deciding for others we ignore/underweight their VFs.
c. Parallel increases in VFs in oneself and another leads to decreased altruism.
d. We imagine others experience VFs when we experience them.
e. People underestimate the impact of others’ VFs on others’ behaviour.
Visceral factors and emotions will also affect the trade-offs people make in pursuing different goals. Visceral factors will compromise the stability of preferences particularly in the short term because internal bodily states can change so rapidly. Whilst visceral factors are essential to human survival and basic daily functioning, they may conflict with higher-level cognitive processes. The extent of the conflict between cognition and VFs will depend on the intensity of the VFs. VFs are overwhelming in “hot” states but in “cold” states cognitive factors will exert more influence. Misjudgements can occur when individuals underestimate the impact of visceral factors in a cold state.
VFs are often neglected in standard economic models because these tend to focus on 
rational motivators of behaviour. More recently, there has been an increasing recognition of VFs, for example in models of addiction and in analyses of emotional factors such as fear in situations of risk and uncertainty (see, for example, Loewenstein 2000; Laibson 1997; Bernheim and Rangel 2004).
Social emotions
In Chapter 6 we explored some of the social influences on behaviour and choices, and emotions in the form of social emotions are strong influences on our sociality. Social emotions are associated with more highly evolved decision-making systems. Simon (1967) emphasizes the role of emotion in social interactions. Humans are socialized to acquire sophisticated sets of cues enabling appropriate responses to interactions with others. Given the complexity of these human interactions, there will be a large number and range of social stimuli and these will increase the emotionality of social situations. Emotions will  155 SoCIal E M o tIonS
also interact with social motivations and preferences, including inequity aversion: social 
emotions may reinforce external sanctions by inducing negative emotional states when behaviour is antisocial (Elster 1998). In this way, social norms will regulate and sustain certain emotions, in encouraging conformity to particular social and economic norms.
Social emotions may also be associated with collective behaviour, for example herd -
ing in financial markets. Acting with a group may moderate fear but has the unintended consequence of generating speculative bubbles. Responses in uncertain social situations will differ from responses in isolated situations and/or when outcomes are more certain. Uncertainty in financial markets, for example, will generate unconscious, non-rational herding as an instinctive response to endogenously generated volatility. When individual panics precipitate “social panics” this may reflect interplay between risk, anxiety and fear (Loewenstein et al. 2007). Markets will fluctuate erratically, reflecting social mood and 
contributing to financial instability (Prechter and Parker 2007).
Emotions are affected by social context, although there is some evidence that emo -
tional responses are suppressed in extreme circumstances. Erber et al.  (2004) postulate 
social constraints affect mood regulation and processing. Social norms may constrain the expression of usual human emotions in extreme institutional settings. In the degrad -
ing conditions of Abu Graib or the Stanford prison experiment as described in earlier 
 c
hapters , the dehumanization of prisoners was exacerbated by the prisoners’ suppression 
of their own socio-emotional responses – pity, for example – thus compromising the es -
sence of their own “humanness” (Haney et al.  1973; Zimbardo 2007).
Personality can play a role, too. For the Stanford prison experiment, individual pre -
dispositions were shown to affect preferences for antisocial opportunities. The students participating in the experiment were initially asked to volunteer for a prison treatment versus a control treatment and those who had self-selected into the prison treatment scored less highly in measures of sociability such as altruism and empathy. They scored more highly in measures of antisocial tendencies such as Machiavellianism, aggression, authoritarianism, narcissism and social dominance (Carnahan and McFarland 2007).
Lee, Amir and Ariely (2009) test the relationship between emotions and quick 
 de
cision-making within a dual-system model using experimental evidence. Experimental 
subjects were given a set of binary product choices alongside the name, picture and a short description of the products they were offered. Emotions and affect were manipulated in different ways. First, pictures were given in colour versus black and white photos, assum -
ing that coloured images are more vivid and therefore more emotionally salient. Second, the subjects were asked to remember two versus ten occasions when their feelings and emotions gave them the right instincts and this was done in order to prime the subjects to have either high trust or low trust in their feelings. It was assumed that those subjects given the more difficult task (remembering ten occasions) would be more doubtful about the trustworthiness of their feelings. Third, subjects were primed to form beliefs about their cognitive capacity by being asked to remember ten versus three numbers. Using the same insight as for the second treatment, this was done to manipulate the subjects’ judgements of their own cognitive ability: it was assumed that if the subjects found it hard to recall positive examples of cognitive success then they would have less faith in their cognitive capacity.
The results consistently indicated that greater reliance on emotional reactions dur -
ing decision-making is associated with greater preference consistency and less cognitive 156 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
noise. Additionally, the results of a meta-analysis based on data from all five experiments 
show that products that elicit a stronger emotional response are more likely to yield consistent preferences. For all the manipulations, greater reliance on emotions led to in -
creased preference consistency. When subjects had low trust in their cognitive capacity, they relied more on emotions. When they had high trust in their feelings, they relied more on emotions. When they had colour photos, they relied more on emotions. The positive impact of emotions on preference consistency supports dual-system models and also models emphasizing the positive impact of emotions in decision-making.
We have seen in this chapter that personality, mood and emotions affect economic 
and financial decision-making in a wide range of ways. Personality traits, together with individual differences such as age and gender, will have an impact on economic prefer -
ence parameters including risk attitudes, time preference, social preferences and pref -
erences for leisure. Personality will also interact with cognitive ability to determine socio-economic outcomes including educational ability, job performance and unemploy-ment history. Emotions and personality will interact when specific personality traits cre -
ate predispositions making some people susceptible to specific emotions and moods.
The impact of personality can be quantified though there are important limitations. 
Personality tests may give imperfect proxies for personality traits meaning that quantita -
tive analyses will be prone to measurement errors. Unravelling cause and effect between personality traits and socio-economic outcomes can be difficult too, especially as some personality traits may be affected by events and experience, creating problems of reverse causality. Overall, the literature on personality in economic decision-making is underdevel -
oped and so there are many opportunities to further economic understanding in this  area.
Emotions are more difficult to measure than personality though neuroeconomic stud -
ies have illuminated some of the neural correlates and identified ways in which cognition and affect can interact. Emotions can have an overwhelming impact on 
 dec
ision-making 
and sometimes that impact is positive. They can play a positive role in guiding 
 de
cision-making as they may enable people to make decisions quickly and efficiently. 
They also play an important role in social decision-making and the various manifestations of sociality explored in Chapter 6 can be understood as the product of social emotions. In other circumstances, however, emotions – together with visceral factors – can have a destructive impact and they are often implicated in impulsive, unwanted behaviours such as addiction, as explored in Chapter 8.
Introducing personality, mood and emotions into economic analysis leads to some 
relatively novel economic policy implications. The insight that personality is malleable in early childhood but becomes more rigid in adulthood suggests that more resources could be devoted to early childhood interventions because those interventions can have an im -
pact, not only in developing cognitive ability but also in enabling children to acquire the skills to enable them to maximize their potential in adulthood. At a microeconomic level, recognizing that traits and predispositions can create comparative advantages suggests that when employers pay attention to personality as well as skills then this will enable them to operate more efficiently because they will be effectively matching their employ -
ees/potential employees to specific jobs and tasks.
When moods, emotions and visceral factors undermine people’s best long-term in -
tentions then policies based on models incorporating an assumption of strict rationality are less likely to be effective. In some cases, policies should focus on limiting the role  157 CHaPtEr S UMM arY
of emotional factors in specific situations – for example, taxes to limit impulsive, risk-  
se
eking behaviours such as rogue trading on financial markets, consumption of addictive 
substances and/or gambling.
There have also been policy initiatives focused on designing gadgets to help people 
to recognize when emotions are overwhelming reason; for example, Thaler and Sunstein 
(2008) describe the Ambient Orb technology which glows a specific colour depending on energy use; it glows red for high levels of energy use, giving a quick, emotionally sa -
lient signal to the householder to reduce their energy use. This sort of technology is now commonly used in domestic “smart” meters. Similar technology is available to monitor trading decisions: General Electric and ABN-Amro have developed the Rationalizer which monitors traders’ physiological states and produces alerts when a trader is overexcited.
Overall, recognizing that personality, moods, emotions and visceral factors can have 
a profound impact on behaviour leads to the implication that firms’ and governments’ policies should allow for the fact that people are not always making reasonable, logical calculations. Policies which are designed to slow decision-making down in situations when people are likely to be misled by mercurial moods and emotions are likely to be as effective, if not more effective, than standard policy tools.
Chapter summary
 •Building on literatures from standard economics, behavioural economists explore individual differences in personality traits to explain differences in behaviour – 
 dr
awing on a range of insights from personality theory in psychology.
 •Personality traits are measured in a wide range of ways in psychology but economists commonly use the Big Five “OCEAN” measures – where OCEAN = Openness, Con -
scientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.
 •Some of these differences in personality traits have been associated with life chances – conscientiousness particularly links with job performance, employability and life sat -
isfaction generally.
 •Economists have traditionally neglected the role of emotions in decision-making, but behavioural economists are now starting to fill the gap – drawing on insights from psychology.
 •Moods and emotions are different from each other. Moods are more diffuse and determined by exogenous factors, for example the weather. Emotions tend to be 
 co
ntext-specific and sometimes reflect individual differences: a person’s predispo -
sitions, for example their personality traits, will affect their emotional responses. Aggressive personalities are more likely to feel the emotion of anger, for example.
 •Using emotions to guide behaviour is not necessarily irrational and is consistent with softer  forms of rationality in which the affect heuristic , that is, a quick 
 dec
ision-making 
rule of thumb driven by emotional responses, drives choices – but is commonly 
 as
sociated with behavioural biases.
 •Antonio Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis  captures how emotions give physiological 
cues that can be a useful guide to decision-making. When people suffer damage to emotional processing areas, their economic and financial decision-making is im -
paired. This approach is developed and applied specifically to behavioural economics in George Loewenstein’s visceral factor model .158 PErSonal ItY, MooDS an D E MotIonS
 •Emotions have important implications in a social context, and social emotions help 
to explain some of the behavioural experimental evidence from, for example, ultima -
tum games – introduced in Chapter 2.

Behavioural public policy
Behavioural economics has many insights to offer policy-makers across a range of ar -
eas and there is currently a great interest in behavioural techniques and designing pol -
icies to facilitate behaviour change – including policy questions ranging across energy 
 de
cision-making, environmental behaviour change, through to pensions policies and pol -
icies to reduce poverty in developing countries. In this chapter, we will explore how be -
havioural insights can and have been applied to resolve a range of pressing policy problems.
Behavioural public policy is heavily influenced by contributions from the partner -
ship between behavioural economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar  – Cass Sustein. 
They outline some of the key facets of behavioural public policy in their 2008 bestseller 
Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and Happiness . Both have had a substantial influence 
on government policy – Cass Sunstein advised former US President Barak Obama and Richard Thaler advised former UK Prime Minister David Cameron’s Behavioural Insights Team – now commercialized and the prototype for the growing number of (what are now nicknamed) ‘Nudge Units’ around the world.
A key focus in behavioural nudging policies is on social influences. The emphasis on 
social preferences and attitudes in economic behaviour paralleled a revival of interest in social themes in politics in 2010  – in the UK led by UK Prime Minister David Cameron. 
His conception of a Big Society – a “third sector” based in small social communities – drew  on themes of sociality. The hope was  that the social connections that characterize the 
Big Society can enable communities to overcome economic, social and political problems obviating the need for top-down governance from Whitehall. Ironically, in some ways this Big Society concept develops insights from Keynesian economist Ernst Schumacher’s left-leaning analysis of the benefits of small communities and decentralization, as eluci -
dated in Small is Beautiful (1973). In a similarly ironic way, left-leaning Maurice Glasman has recently developed conservative themes in his conception of “Blue Labour”, a model which rejects the focus on centralization traditionally associated with left-wing thought.
The modern concept of a Big Society reshuffled the political cards in a number of 
ways. Traditional conservative ideology focuses on the importance of free markets in allowing the invisible hand of the price mechanism to allocate resources efficiently. The economic analysis underlying this ideology is based on an assumption of self-interest. 162 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
Market failure justifies government intervention and left-wing ideology has tended to 
focus on the importance of governments as a reflection of the failure of self-interest in efficiently allocating resources when markets fail. The Big Society concept turns all of that inside out: a Big Society will not work unless people are altruistic, cooperative and helpful. If people are selfish then the Big Society will not go far in resolving economic and social problems and governments will be needed to intervene. Whether or not the Big Society third sector has a useful role to play will depend on our social natures. The ori -
gins of cooperation and self-interest are often very deep-seated and so policy initiatives to harness our instincts for cooperation must reflect a deep understanding of the behavioural and evolutionary roots of cooperation.
A central concept to Thaler and Sunstein’s analysis of behavioural public policy is 
the concept of libertarian paternalism . Libertarian paternalism has two facets designed to ad -
dress the perennial policy-making tension in liberal democracies – of allowing people the freedom to choose for themselves whilst also ensuring that governments play a role in improving peoples’ lives via the provision of public goods, ensuring an equitable society and economy, and in stabilizing economies and financial systems. Thaler and Sunstein’s concept of libertarian paternalism relies on guides to behaviour in the form of nudges . 
Nudges push people towards better, more constructive behaviours. They are designed to combine freedom with government intervention. The idea is that governments intervene by designing policies to nudge people in a more constructive direction, but people are free to resist the nudge. Nudges are libertarian because people still have freedom  to choose 
but governments are intervening in designing and implementing nudges and nudges are paternalistic in that sense.
Nudges are advocated by some as an alternative to traditional economic policies such 
as taxes and subsidies – focusing on the idea that nudges can encourage behaviour change, thus reducing some of the unproductive biases in decision-making, some of which  we 
explored in previous chapters. Nudges also have a social purpose when they resolve prob -
lems of externalities – when the actions of one individual have impacts on others around them in ways that are not captured by markets and prices. Costs (and sometimes bene -
fits) are inflicted on other people who are not compensated for these negative impacts. If nudges can be designed to encourage people towards more pro-social behaviour then externalities will be reduced – we explore some examples below.
Nudges can also help to ameliorate what some behavioural economists have called 
internalities – a concept we introduced in Chapter 8 – in the context of bad habits and addiction. One person’s actions – for example impulsive actions associated with addictive behaviours – has negative impacts for their future selves. To illustrate with an example: a person who smokes today imposes negative impacts – negative internalities – on their future self who has to deal with the health consequences of past unhealthy habits. Nudges can be designed to help people’s future selves by encouraging people to change their bad habits today.
A key building block of Thaler and Sunstein’s nudging approach is the design of 
good choice architecture . Building on a solid understanding of the architecture of choice, 
in other words understanding fully how people choose and decide using insights from psychology and sociology as well as economics, policy-makers can design their nudges in ways that fit well with real-world decision-making, by designing nudges that simplify complex choices, and enable quick and easy learning via clear feedback. If well designed,  163 nUD gIng PolIC IES For EnErgY a nD tHE EnVIro nMEnt
behaviour changes engineered via nudges will be “sticky” – that is, people will not return 
to their old “bad” behaviours once the nudge goes away. There are pitfalls in the nudging approach and we will explore some of those at the end of this chapter, but for now we will concentrate on explaining how, why and when nudging works – specifically in the context of some influential types of nudges. Some of the pioneering nudges from Thaler 
and Sunstein were designed to leverage people’s susceptibility to status quo bias meaning that policy-makers can set default options to leverage status quo bias – by requiring people to make the effort to “opt out” of the most constructive forms of behaviour. For example – to increase incidence of organ donation, policy-makers can set the default so that people automatically donate unless they opt out. Given that people will need to exert effort to opt out, this nudge helps to increase rates of organ donation. Other common forms of nudge include social nudges and nudges designed to reduce problems of present bias, as we explore below.
nudging policies for energy and the environment
Energy and environmental issues and problems are a particular focus of nudging policies. One way in which nudges can have an impact is via a better design of the choice archi -
tecture, for example by focusing the design of choice architecture on effective feedback. Thaler and Sunstein (2008) emphasize the importance of salient and frequent feedback in energy planning. Hargreaves, Nye and Burgess (2010) found that information feedback on electricity consumption leads to decreased use. Darby (2006) also emphasizes the im -
portance of direct feedback with information presented clearly, using computerized tools; indirect feedback is more effective in addressing larger impacts, for example seasonal impacts on energy consumption. Direct feedback via self-meter reading, direct displays, consumption displays and interactive feedback lead to savings of up to 15%; indirect feed -
back, including frequent bills and information leaflets, can generate up to 10% savings (Darby 2006, Brophy Haney et al.  2009a,b).
A very commonly used nudging policy to resolve environmental and energy problems 
is to leverage social influences, including social learning and social pressure - 
 ex
plored 
in Chapter 6. Most of us tend to want to do what others are doing most of the time. Be -
havioural public policy-makers use this insight to design a range of social nudges  – very 
commonly applied in the context of energy and environmental decision-making. In terms of informational influence, social learning about energy efficiency can take place effec -
tively within group settings. Nye and Hargreaves (2009) and Nye and Burgess (2008) outlined evidence from two UK experiments conducted by Global Action Plan in which environmental information was communicated in a social setting. One (the Environmen -
tal Champions Programme) was office-based and focused on 280 people with a team of energy champions drawn from different departments. These champions engaged in a three-month communication campaign, providing practical information about environ -
mentally friendly behaviour leading to a 38% reduction in waste production and a 12% reduction in energy consumption. The second programme – the Eco-Teams Programme, focused on household habits and involved neighbourhood meetings to inform communi -
ties about energy use. There were a number of positive impacts: 16% adopted green en -
ergy tariffs, 37% installed energy-efficient light bulbs and 17% reduced domestic heating. Participants observed that the scheme worked because, whilst they were environmentally 164 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
aware before participating, the EcoTeams Programme enabled  practical knowledge to be  
communicated to participants.
Social nudges linked to reputation effects have also been shown to have power to 
change behavior, for example when people’s actions are publicized. Pallak et al.  (1980) ana -
lyzed the gas consumption behaviour of a sample of Iowan households. A control group of 
households were given some energy-saving tips but the advice had no significant impact on their energy use. Then a matching sample of households was told that they would receive positive publicity for their efforts; they would be identified as energy-saving citizens in local newspaper articles. The publicity treatment had a significant, positive effect with each homeowner saving on average 422 cubic feet of natural gas equivalent to savings in the first month of 12.2% in gas consumption. But the most interesting result occurred when the households were sent a letter telling them that they would not receive any positive publicity after all – yet, on average, these households increased their fuel savings to 15.5% in the second month. Pallack et al.  found similar results in an analysis of air-conditioning 
use. These apparently anomalous results have been attributed to the fact that the initial promise of publicity encouraged householders to pre-commit to energy reduction and this commitment did not disappear when the promise of positive publicity was withdrawn.
Similar nudges are used to improve people’s environmental decision-making. 
 So
cial 
norms will drive public-spirited behaviour and conditional contributions to public goods and these norms and pressures will be affected by the values and attitudes outlined above  – for example, attitudes towards environmentally responsible choices such as recy -
cling. Schultz et al. (2007) analyse these questions from the perspective of norms – which 
are like rules and standards for behaviour. Norms include descriptive norms providing points of comparison – commonly social norms describing other people’s choices; and injunctive norms which incorporate instructions. To illustrate the difference between descriptive norms and injunctive norms, Goldstein et al.  (2008) analysed hotel towel reuse 
and tested the impact of different types of information. Hotel guests were given cards asking them to reuse towels either to help the hotel as an injunctive norm; or – for the de -
scriptive norm – some information about what the guests’ fellow guests usually chose to do. In the third control condition, the card did not include any specific reasons for towel reuse. Goldstein et al . found that the card appealing to the descriptive social norm led to 
significant increases in towel recycling.
Norms can also be categorized according to their impacts. Norms can be constructive, 
for example descriptive norms can encourage people who are consuming too much rela -
tive to others to consume less in the future; but descriptive norms can also be destructive if they generate a “boomerang effect”, that is, if they encourage people who are con -
suming less than others to move consumption towards the average by consuming more. Norms can also be reconstructive: for example, injunctive norms such as a pictogram of a smiley faces versus a frowny face can reinforce normative signals.
Schultz (1999) notes that descriptive social norms can be communicated in written 
information. Conformity does not require the direct observation of others. He investi -
gated participants’ awareness of causal relationships between descriptive social norms and behaviour and found that normative information about average recycling by neighbour -
hood families increased the amount and frequency of recycling.
Schultz et al. study these norms by analysing the energy consumption behaviour of 
290 households in San Marcos, California. All households had visible energy meters  which  165 Nudgi N g policies for e N ergy a N d the e N viro N me N t
were read before, during and after the interventions. The households were left writ -
ten messages. Half were just given descriptive information about consumption in other 
households; the other half were given the descriptive information plus an injunctive 
visual signal indicating social approval/disapproval in their energy consumption. Below 
average consumption was rewarded with a smiley emoticon – . Above average con -
sumption was “punished” with a frowny emoticon – . Schultz et al.  found that the de -
scriptive norm message about average neighbourhood use did lead to energy savings but 
there was  a 
 
boomerang effect dependent on whether the household’s consumption was 
relatively  high or relatively low. When the injunctive message was combined with the 
injunctive emoticons to indicate social approval/disapproval the boomerang effect was 
eliminated.
Nolan et al. (2008) extend these findings using two studies aimed at assessing the 
weight that people ascribe to social norms as factors affecting their energy conservation 
decisions. The first study surveyed 810 Californians to explore stated reasons for engaging in energy conservation and to test actual factors influencing conservation behaviour. Re -
spondents were asked a series of questions about their energy conservation beliefs, moti -
vations and actual behaviour. Self-reported beliefs were assessed according to answers to questions such as:  how much will saving energy benefit society/the environment? How 
much money can you save? How often do your neighbours try to conserve energy?
Behaviour/intentions were judged by the answer to the question, “How often do you 
try to conserve energy?” Motivations were assessed by questions about reasons for trying 
to save energy, for example using less energy saves money, protects the environment, benefits society, other people are doing it. Responses were rated on a 4-point scale from “not at all important” to “extremely important”. The findings revealed an inconsistency between the stated motivations and actual behaviour: “because others are doing it” was judged to be the least important reason at the self-reported motivation stage but the high -
est correlation with actual conservation behaviour was a person’s beliefs about whether their neighbours were doing it.
Nolan et al.’s second study was a field experiment involving 981 Californian households 
in San Marcos assessing participants’ awareness of the extent to which their behaviour was affected by different messages. The experimental design was similar to Schultz et al.’s 
(2007) and Goldstein et al. ’s (2008) study. Normative information was circulated in the 
forms of messages on door hangers; each message was illustrated with a graphic icon. The 
messages urged the householders to conserve energy via specific conservation 
 
behaviours 
(e.g. taking shorter showers, turning off lights/air conditioning). There were four appeal treatments, each appealing to different motivations: three appeals used non-normative messages: protecting environment (environmental responsibility), benefiting society (so -
cial responsibility) and saving money (self-interest). The fourth appeal was based on a descriptive norm with factual information given about the energy conservation behaviour 
of recipients’ neighbours. There was also an information-only control treatment – people were just told that they could save energy by taking the various actions without appealing to any specific motivation.
Actual energy use in home was the dependent variable and electricity meter readings 
were taken before and after the intervention. This reliance on objective information from meter readings prevented inaccuracies from self-reporting and/or imperfect memory bias. The data showed that normative social influence had a direct impact on conservation 166 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
behaviour and the social norm condition led to the biggest reduction in energy con -
sumption; people conserved more energy under the social norm condition than under 
the control condition or the other informational conditions; however, the householders did not detect the influence of these messages; they did not appear to realize that they were affected by the descriptive norm. Nolan et al . conclude that these findings suggest 
that naïve psychology-based beliefs about energy conservation are inaccurate. Trying to encourage people to be socially responsible/protect the environment rarely succeeds in increasing pro-environmental behaviours – perhaps because people have already adjusted their behaviour to these factors. In changing the behaviour of the recalcitrant, new moti -
vations and messages are needed so that normative messages can reach new populations who might not otherwise want to conserve energy.
Allcott (2011), drawing on research from Goldstein et al.  (2008), Schultz et al.  (2007) 
and Nolan et al.  (2008), focuses on the role played by social norms in guiding energy 
conservation strategies and identifies three pathways via which social norms play a role: a tournament pathway via which people gain utility from outperforming their neighbours’ frugality; a conditional cooperation pathway via which people contribute to a public good if others do too; and a social learning pathway. Allcott notes that boomerang effects can be explained most easily in terms of the second and third pathways though he does also emphasize the role of feedback.
Allcott analysed data from a randomized natural field experiment using Home Energy 
Reports (HERs) in collaboration with OPOWER – electricity utility in Minnesota. The electricity consumption of 80,000 treatment and control households was analysed. Each household was sent a HER with two features: an Action Steps Module giving energy-
 sa
ving 
tips; and a Social Comparison Module – comparing a household’s energy consumption with that of its 100 geographically closest neighbours. The monthly programme lead to decreases in energy consumption of 1.9–2.0% but with decay effects; impacts decreased in the period between receiving one monthly report and the next but then increased again once the next report was received.
Allcott infers that this reflects an interaction of social norms and bounded rationality/
heuristics, in particular the availability heuristic. There is an “attention channel”. People do know about energy conservation strategies but they need reminders because attention is malleable and non-durable. Receiving a HER reminded people about the strategies that they should be taking. Given bounded attention to social norms, social norms will only affect behaviour when norms are at the top of the  mind.
nudges for healthy living
One of the key policy issues of our time is declining health reflecting lifestyle choices in -
cluding bad eating habits, excessive alcohol consumption and insufficient exercise. These problems reflect the fact that we are not always good at doing things that are unpleasant in the short term to deliver good outcomes in the long run. We are susceptible to pres-ent bias, lack of self-control, temptation and procrastination. Healthy lifestyle involves exercise and eating nutritious foods and an increasing volume of behavioural research is focusing on when and why these good habits can be uncommon.
Parkin, Boyd and Walker (2011) estimate the fraction of cancers in the UK in 2010 
which could be attributable to exposures to lifestyle and environmental risk factors and  167 nUD gES For H Eal tHY lIV Ing
therefore were to some extent preventable. Tobacco was the major risk factor but diet 
and lifestyle factors, including low consumption of fruit and vegetables, excessive con -
sumption of alcohol, salt and red meat together with insufficient exercise and being over -
weight/obese were also major risk factors.
Healthy food
Chapter 8 explored the ways in which economists and behavioural economists explain bad habits and addictive behaviour. We all know which bad habits we should avoid: smoking, eating too much fat and sugar, drinking too much alcohol and/or caffeine; not getting enough exercise – a sedentary habit. There have been numerous studies of un -
healthy behaviours that have significant impacts on people’s lives. These behaviours reflect the impact of a range of behavioural factors. Social norms play a key role, for alcohol and marijuana consumption as well as cigarette smoking (Haines and Spear 1996; Hansen and Graham 1991; Thombs et al.  1997).
Adler and Stewart (2009) identify a range of factors affecting obesity including an 
“obesogenic” environment: areas where healthy, fresh food is difficult to find but un -
healthy takeaway food is quickly available. In addition, this unhealthy food is often adver -
tized using cues designed to exploit impulsive visceral instincts. These insights add weight to Laibson, Loewenstein, and Smith and Tasnádi’s analysis of the impact of environment cues on addictive behaviour, explored in Chapter 8. Solutions focus on making healthy food more widely available, particularly for children. A range of initiatives have emerged including healthy school meals campaigns in the UK and US – championed by UK chef Jamie Oliver and focusing on providing children with access to healthy school food.
Belot and James (2009) analyse the impacts of Jamie Oliver’s campaigns by studying 
the impact of diet on educational performance. They compared the performance of pri -
mary school children at schools in Greenwich, London. Jamie Oliver’s “Feed Me Better” school meals campaign was launched at some Greenwich schools. The quality of school meals was improved by  reducing the volume of processed foods and increasing the provi -
sion of fruit, vegetables and water and healthy, freshly cooked food. The performance of children at these schools was compared with performance by a control group of children at schools not participating in the Feed Me Better campaign. For children in the treatment group, educational outcomes improved significantly and absenteeism fell. Jamie Oliver’s campaigns had similar beneficial effects elsewhere including in the US and not only fo -
cused on increasing the quality of food but also on changing some of the social norms surrounding people’s attitudes towards food and healthy eating.
Understanding bad health habits: not going to the gym
For most people, getting enough exercise is one aspect of a healthy lifestyle that can be particularly hard to maintain – and encouraging more exercise is one promising route for a combination of economic insights and nudging policies. Encouraging gym member -
ship can be done by designing gym membership offers in ways that harness some of the behavioural decision-making styles outlined in previous chapters. Standard economic ap -
proaches to contract choice assume that people choose from a “menu” of contracts using a rational, optimizing approach incorporating exponential discounting. But DellaVigna and Malmendier’s gym evidence shows that this does not happen in the real world. DellaVigna 168 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
and Malmendier’s (2006) study of gym membership/use shows people paying far more 
for annual and monthly gym membership plans than is justifiable given their infrequent attendance. They analyse a natural experiment on gym membership which showed that people seem to be willing to pay not to go the gym.
DellaVigna and Malmendier assess data from three New England health clubs includ -
ing detailed attendance data for 7,752 and 8,273 enrolment spells focusing their analysis on the first enrolment spell. They also assess survey evidence from 97 health clubs. They analyse three choices facing people signing up for gym membership: pay as you go; an annual flat rate contract; or a monthly flat rate contract. Standard theory would predict that price per expected attendance should be lower for those signing up to a flat rate con -
tract than for those using pay-per-visit. The expected number of visits under the annual contract should exceed expected number of visits under the monthly contract; average forecasts of attendance should equal average actual attendance; low attenders should delay cancellation for at most a few days; people signing up for an annual contract should have larger survival probabilities, remaining as gym members for longer.
From their analyses of health club data, DellaVigna and Malmendier found limited ev -
idence in support of the predictions of a rational gym-goer. The average price per visit was over $17 for monthly contracts and $15 on annual contracts, yet the pay-per-visit fee was significantly lower at $10. So, consumers choosing monthly membership pay on average 70% more than if they were on the pay-as-you-go contract. Average attendance in months 2–4 was 10% higher under the annual contract than the monthly contract. The average forecast of attendance was more than twice as large as actual attendance for monthly con -
tracts. The average cancellation lag was 2.31 months between last attendance and cancel -
lation for monthly members. Survival probability (share still enrolled at 15 months) was estimated using Probit (conditioned on gender, age, etc.). People on a monthly contract were 17% more likely to stay enrolled beyond a year even though they were paying higher fees (than for the annual contract) for the option to cancel each month. Most of these findings were inconsistent with a rational optimizing approach.
DellaVigna and Malmendier suggest a number of behavioural explanations for the 
apparently anomalous behaviour of gym goers. Their decisions may have reflected risk aversion: a flat-rate contract minimizes variance of payments. Transaction costs of daily payments may have created a preference for flat-rate contracts. For flat-rate contracts there were additional membership benefits including psychological benefits. Preferences were varying over time and whilst there was rational updating, it was slow. Limited memory might have meant that people forgot to cancel their memberships. If health-club employ -
ees are incentivized to sell the more expensive flat-rate contracts, then persuasion might also have had an impact on the gym-goer’s choices.
The behaviour can also be explained using different assumptions about inter-
 tem
poral 
decision-making. Seemingly paradoxical choices may reflect pre-commitment strategies. Sophisticated consumers realized that they were vulnerable to problems of time incon -
sistency and so tied themselves using a pre-commitment device. By paying relatively large sums of money upfront they were hoping to encourage their future selves into going to the gym more often in the future. Time inconsistency may also explain the results for the naïve gym-goers. If initial attendance was high, overconfidence about future self-control meant that they overestimated net benefits, perhaps reflecting projection bias and the anchoring heuristic. 169 BEHaVIoUra l DE VEloPM Ent  PolICY
At the same time, there may be heterogeneity in overconfidence. Users paying a high 
price per visit on monthly contract are also the ones with a longer cancellation lag. Overall, 
DellaVigna and Malmendier’s findings suggest that observed health choices do not match actual behaviours , generating biases in decision-making. In designing nudges to encourage 
people to go to the gym more often, insights from DellaVigna and Malmendier’s research can be used in devising contracts that fit Thaler and Sunstein’s criteria for good choice architecture. An important policy implication is that, in the fight against obesity, it isn’t enough just to subsidize health clubs – whether via public subsidies or health insurance schemes. There is no guarantee that just because people have a gym membership they will actually go to the gym. Social nudges are likely to have an impact too  – not just via giving 
people information about the exercise of their neighbours but by encouraging people to engage in exercise as a social activity. Devices for regular feedback and reminders are likely to tap into people’s quick decision-making responses, so apps and other technology can be effective in this context. Other more standard economic insights can be used in combination with behavioural nudges, for example if people can build exercise into their daily route then the transaction costs and inconveniences associated with exercise will be reduced. Combinations of nudges will work, for example social exercise opportunities offered within the workplace and lunchtime group exercise, are likely to be effective.
Behavioural development policy
Behavioural public policy tools are applied particularly widely in development 
 po
licy-making, to reduce problems of severe poverty in developing countries. Often these 
policies are tested using large-scale randomized controlled trials, the principles of which are explored in Chapter 1. Some of the main forms of behavioural public policy used in development policy include nudges leveraging present bias and social nudges.
Present bias and farming habits
An influential study of pre-commitment tools is Duflo et al. ’s (2011) study exploring nudges 
to encourage farmers to use fertilizer to improve yields (see also Duflo and Banerjee 2011 ). 
Duflo et al. (2011) link time inconsistency to procrastination in agrarian working capital 
investment. They hypothesize that the failure of Kenyan farmers to buy fertilizer reflects not only liquidity constraints but poor inter-temporal planning reflecting time inconsist -
ency and procrastination. Duflo et al.  constructed a randomized control trial to test the dif -
ferential policy impact of a Savings and Fertilizer Initiative Program (SAFI). Farmers were offered access to SAFI in two ways: in the simple version of SAFI, the farmer was offered fertilizer on the spot at harvest time; in the second version of SAFI, the farmers were vis -
ited before the harvest season and were offered the option to buy fertilizer at a later point in time. Both versions of SAFI led to a significant increase in fertilizer use. If farmers were rational in a standard sense then, for the second version of SAFI, they would order the fer -
tilizer for a future date and invest their money in the meantime. If they were time-incon -
sistent and naïve, then they would overestimate their ability to save for a future fertilizer purchase and would agree to buy it at a late delivery date. A way to overcome this problem is to offer small, time-limited subsidies for fertilizer purchases as a way to overcome inef -
ficient farming practices, such as those emerging from problems of procrastination.170 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
Social nudges in Indian villages
We explored above how social nudges can be used in addressing policy questions around 
energy and the environment. Similar nudges have been used in behavioural development economics too. Social learning and peer effects from observing the actions of others can have a particularly profound impact, particularly because social capital and social net -
works can be vital when market institutions are not well developed. One area in which social pressures and social learning in networks can improve living standards is in the area of health and sanitation, a particular problem in rural, underdeveloped regions with high levels of infant mortality. Pattanayak et al.  (2008) explore the “shame or subsidy” 
debate: experts disagree about the relative impacts of monetary incentives/public goods provision versus shaming and social pressure as emotional motivator to encourage the development of healthy social norms. They hypothesized that social pressure and peer monitoring could be as effective as subsidies in encouraging people to develop healthier habits. Learning will also play a role and Pattanayak et al.  explored the effectiveness of san -
itation campaigns focusing on information, education and communication (IEC) about good sanitary practices.
They tested their hypotheses using randomized experimental design to explore the 
effectiveness of sanitation campaigns in the Indian state of Orissa. They selected 20 vil -
lages for a treatment trial and another 20 villages as a control group, with 1,050 house -
holds in total. The villages in the treatment group were exposed to an IEC campaign to educate people about sanitation, safe water and hygiene. In addition, all 40 villages (i.e. the control group as well as the treatment group) were given access to subsidies to enable villagers to buy latrines. Pattanayak et al.  postulated though that knowledge was 
not enough and that behaviour would not change without emotionally salient triggering events. They incorporated Community Led Sanitation into their experimental design in -
cluding three tools: a walk of shame – a community walk during which examples of poor hygiene were identified to the group; defecation mapping – in which villages participated in identifying the spatial distribution of defecation and its effects; and fecal calculations – in which the volume of fecal matter and its likely impacts were discussed.
They found that the IEC campaign had a strongly significant impact in increasing the 
adoption and use of latrines in the villages; latrine ownership increased from 6% to 32% in the treatment villages. They also found that shame and subsidies together were more effective than subsidies alone. There was significant heterogeneity across villages: lots of people participated in some villages; in others, very few participated, perhaps reflecting social complementarities. The more people in your network are choosing an action, the more likely you are to choose it too. They found that learning did not generalize however and there were no other significant sanitation behaviour changes. Having more latrines did not lead to hand washing for example. They concluded that sanitation worldwide can be improved via the implementation of “social marketing” tools such as social pressure and peer monitoring in policy design.
Identity, in-groups and out-groups
In behavioural development economics, insights about social preferences – as outlined in Chapter 6 – are applied to the analysis of post-conflict behaviours. For example,   171 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlI C PolI CY: C Hall EngES an D P ItFall S
Bauer  et al. (2011) explore egalitarian motives in children exposed to armed conflict and 
find that intergroup conflicts had significant impacts on children’s cooperative behaviour. 
They studied children soon after the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia for control of South Ossetia. They asked them to play variants of dictator games and envy games, with sweet treats as rewards. Envy games disentangle advantageous and disadvantageous inequity aversion , introduced in Chapter 2, by exploring what happens when players are 
facing higher total payoffs both to themselves and to the other player, but at a relative dis -
advantage to themselves. For example, a child choosing between offering two sweets to another child and keeping two for themselves versus offering four sweets to another child and keeping three sweets for themselves. Bauer et al.  find that the children’s experience of 
conflict during the Ossetia war had impacts on their other-regarding preferences, and was associated with increased egalitarianism and decreased competition when playing games with their in-group but parochialism and increased competition when playing games with the out-group. They find similar results for adults in Sierra Leone.
Alexander and Christia (2011) also analyse sociality in a post-war setting using evi -
dence from public good experiments. These were conducted on religiously diverse Catho -
lic Croat and Muslim Bosniak communities in post-war Mostar, Bosnia-
 He
rzegovina. 
Alexander and Christia found that cooperation could be achieved using sanctions but that the effectiveness of these sanctions depended on whether the communities were segregated or integrated. In mixed but segregated communities, participants contributed low amounts whether there were sanctions or not, but in integrated mixed communi -
ties, contributions were more than doubled even without sanctions and with sanctions, contributions were more than tripled. This evidence suggests that institutional environ -
ments play an important role in reintegrating post-war communities perhaps suggesting that post-war reconstruction should focus on building institutions designed to moderate 
 et
hno-religious differences in identity.
Behavioural public policy: challenges and pitfalls
Whilst behavioural nudging seems seductively simple, there are problems with the nudging approaches. Nudging is advocated as providing a blend of freedom and gov -
ernment intervention – but this makes it susceptible to criticism from two perspectives. Libertarians criticize the approach because they believe governments should limit their interventions in private decision-making and nudging seems, to them, to increase gov -
ernment control. From the opposite political perspective – nudging may be a weak instrument in enabling people to achieve a better situation for themselves. For these critics of nudging, nudging is a “cop-out” and an excuse for governments to reduce their commitments to intervention by putting the responsibility for reducing inter -
nalities and externalities in the hands of individuals. In this, nudging is somewhat contradictory in that it makes individuals responsible for their decisions whilst at the same time being grounded in assumptions about how people are not good at choosing for themselves. 
This raises the additional question of, if people don’t choose well for themselves, 
then how can behavioural public policy-makers know what’s best, if people don’t know themselves?172 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
Another key challenge for behavioural policy-making is to design policies that are 
both sustainable and scalable because behavioural public policy relies on engineering 
behaviour change at the microeconomic level of each individual decision-maker. This is both an advantage and disadvantage. Top-down macro policy applies to whole groups simultaneously. There is no need to worry about the individual.
Some nudges are superficial, quick fixes that may not lead to deep and lasting behav -
iour change. For example, in the context of the social nudges to encourage reductions in energy consumption, as highlighted above, some behavioural biases lead some consumers to use too much electricity, for example, but in controlling energy use it is not enough just to switch off some lights when heating is the major energy drain. Similarly, some-times policies will just change a single behaviour when whole sets of behaviours need to adapt. The studies of sanitation in India show that people will install more latrines but the awareness of the need for good sanitation does not necessarily generalize to other behav -
iours to improve sanitation, such as hand washing (Pattanayak et al.  2009).
The problem for policy-makers in designing ‘scalable’ nudges, that is, nudges that pos -
itively affect as many people as possible, is that individual preferences and attitudes will be affected by differences in age, gender, education, socio-economic status and political affiliation. Nudges may not be easily scalable if it is difficult to nudge large segments of a population to change their behaviour. Political attitudes can be a particularly strong bar -
rier. Costa and Kahn (2010) postulate that political opinions play a role reflected in rising polarization in environmental attitudes across political groups: they report that liberals and environmentalists are more responsive to environmental nudges than average and their econometric estimates indicate a 3–6% reduction in energy consumption in Demo -
crat households, against a 1% increase in consumption in Republican households, which may reflect the fact that nudges encourage Republican households to use more energy either because they are “defiers” or because of a boomerang effect. Fairness can be incor -
porated into individual utility functions – for example see Fehr and Schmidt (1999) on in -
equity aversion – but turning these theoretical and philosophical questions into guidance for practical policy makers is difficult, especially as subjectivity is still problematic as the question remains of how to assign weights to inequity aversion. Distributive preferences cover accountability, efficiency, need and equality (Gowdy 2008). Equality raises moral questions and accountability implies that polluters should pay proportionally to emissions.
More generally, given the growing influence of behavioural economics in policy-
 
ma
king, it is important for policy-makers to recognize not only behavioural economics’ 
insights but also its limitations. Sometimes, more traditional policies will be more effec -
tive in dealing with specific types of policy problem, for example traditional policy tools such as regulation and taxation might be better ways to encourage households and busi -
nesses to use energy more efficiently and/or to dissuade large retailers and manufacturers from exploiting impulsive, visceral reactions to food advertising and cigarette packaging. The key is a good balance between innovative but effective policy tools based on insights from behavioural economics alongside more traditional styles of policy-making.
A final limitation is that nudging policy has not yet addressed pressing problems 
of macroeconomic decision-making. Nudging is based around changing individuals’ be -
haviour. It follows that behavioural insights have not found their way substantially into macroeconomic policies and systemic financial regulation. We will explore some of these macroeconomic policy-making issues in the chapters on macroeconomics and financial instability, explored in Part III. 173 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlI C PolI CY: C Hall EngES an D P ItFall S
❖ Case study: behavioural poli Cie s for an online world
One key area which needs new behavioural public policy designs is online privacy 
and security. People are not good at balancing risks is their online decision-  mak
ing. 
Heuristics and biases – explored in Chapter 3- affect a wide range of real-world 
 de
cision-making by households and firms and this case study focuses on lessons from 
online nudging approaches for controlling online  problems of privacy and security . 
For computing decisions, absence of meaningful and available information about se -
curity threats leads to over-optimism and underestimating risks of privacy and secu -
rity breaches. These misperceptions of risk increase vulnerability to problems such as identity theft. For security and human behaviour, Acquisti (2004) and Acquisti and Grossklags (2006) explore a number of other misperceptions of risk specifically affect -
ing online behaviour including status quo and familiarity biases when people prefer the current situation generating status quo bias – a bias captured within prospect theory in which the status quo acts as a reference point (Acquisti 2004; Acquisti and Gross -
klags 2006; Thaler and Sunstein 2008). Some of these biases can be manipulated to encourage people to engage in more efficient behaviour – for example, status quo bias, which is about the fact that when online, people tend to favour the existing situation and will tend to avoid the effort involved in changing their choices. Setting online default options cleverly can exploit this misperception of risk. If the default option applies the maximum privacy protection then a large number of consumers may procrastinate in changing these options, thus protecting them from security violations.
For cybersecurity policies, understanding why and how people misperceive risks may 
lead people to decide that security is not a problem because they haven’t had a problem with it in the recent past. On the other hand, if recent news stories have focused on security risks then people may be disproportionately focused on protecting their secu -
rity. Stories about destructive viruses and malware and/or perils of cloud computing/unsecured information sharing might encourage more people to be careful about how they use privacy settings on Facebook and Twitter.
Anchoring around the reference point may also be relevant: if someone’s friends 
and colleagues are all talking about the benefits of some new software, then a per -
son’s judgement of that software may be anchored around these opinions. Another type of decision-making bias that deserves particular attention is the present bias, introduced in Chapter 7. People’s behaviour may be inconsistent over time: plans to do something to enable their computing (e.g. backing up files) in the future change as the future becomes the present because people procrastinate and they lack self-control.
Bias is not necessarily irrational and may reflect a softer style of rationality than that tra -
ditionally associated with economics, for example if people are treating different financial 
decisions in different ways using different “mental accounts”, for example if online buying is put into the fast account. Acquisti and Grossklags have analysed the implications of bias for people’s choices about privacy and security (Acquisti 2004, Acquisti and Grossklags 2006). They also build on the behavioural economics literature on procrastination and self-
 
co
ntrol (e.g. see O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999; O’Donoghue and Rabin 2001  and DellaVigna 174 BEHaVIoUra l P UBlIC PolICY
and Malmendier 2006). When using the internet, people will procrastinate about setting 
up effective security systems in much the same way as many ordinary people procras -
tinate about backing up files. Procrastination is potentially a key policy issue particularly if the most effective privacy and security solutions are to be driven by individual choices. Assuming that people suffer biases but are sophisticated enough to realize that this might generate security and privacy problems in the future, then they can be encouraged to set up pre-commitment devices such as identity verification systems and/or computer default options which exploit the status quo bias. Employing these devices enables sophisticated users to pre-commit to protecting themselves from security violations in the short term when they might be tempted to act impulsively.
The problem for internet security is that people do not necessarily learn fast about 
their biases. Emotions have an impact because they are quick and impulsive and en -
gage automatic decision-making systems. To enable faster learning, if group leaders can be identified and encouraged to adopt appropriate online protections then others will follow their example. Alternatively, if information about the adoption of safeguards by others is prominent then this normative influence will encourage people to do what others are doing. Cooperation between self-seeking individuals will lead to the evolu -
tion of new social norms (Axelrod 1990). For security and human behaviour, decisions are made in a multidimensional space and reflect contradictory goals and so trust and control are central; effective security and privacy systems will allow transparent communication between trusted parties but will be closed to the “bad guys” (Clark 2010). Attitudes to privacy and security are changing; for example, it is widely believed that the younger generation is more vulnerable to identity theft because they are far more willing to reveal important personal information. In terms of policy implications, perhaps people can be encouraged to take more care in their online decision-making if learning leads to new social norms via advertising, social networking and other forms of social interaction.
Chapter summary
 •Behavioural public policy in economics is based around concepts of libertarian pater -
nalism and choice architecture.
 •Libertarian paternalism captures the idea that nudging policies can be both 
 pat
ernalistic – advocating government intervention via nudges to reduce internalities 
and externalities – whilst also preserving liberty by allowing individuals freedom to 
choose about whether they want to go along with these nudges or not.
 •Effective nudging relies on good design of choice architecture to ensure that nudges are easy and simple to navigate, enable learning via effective feedback and are sticky so that nudges are not just quick fixes.
 •Behavioural public policy suffers from a number of limitations and so nudging is most useful when it is used as a complement to, not a substitute for, conventional economic policies such as taxes and subsidies. 175 rEVISI on q UE StIo nS

neuroeconomics I
Principles
In the exploration of microeconomic principles, so far we have focused on relatively con -
ventional experimental and econometric evidence to illustrate how social and psychological 
influences interact with economic incentives and motivations. A problem with this type of evidence is that it necessarily focuses just on observed actions and choices. These types of data are relatively objective, as much as any scientific study is objective, at least. But in fully exploring the drivers of behaviour we need to know more about what propels people’s ac -
tions. One reason for this is that it is not easy objectively to measure thoughts and feelings. 
Until recently, economists have analysed our decision-making focusing on what we 
do without looking too deeply at empirical evidence about how and why people behave as they do. Partly this is because economists have traditionally assumed that asking people how and why they reached their decisions was fraught by subjectivity and, for 
 pe
rsonal  
reasons experimental , participants have  incentives to conceal their true motivations. As 
Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec (2005) observed, standard economics treat s the brain as 
a “black box”. Information goes in and decisions come out but we do not know what hap -
pens in between. Neuroscience is, however, changing this because it allows scientists to see more about how our brains are processing information. More generally, tools and insights from cognitive neuroscience are now being amalgamated with those from economics to give a much richer account of what underlies our decision-making and, in this and the next chapter, we will explore some of the neuroscientific evidence and its underpinnings.

cision-making, we need to outline some of the key principles of neuroscience. 
Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, its anatomical structure 
and physiology and in the past was regarded as just a branch of biology. However, in the last 50 years it has become an interdisciplinary science which now includes neurochem -
istry, medical neurology and surgery, psychology, linguistics, logic, electronics, computer science and neuroimaging. Neuroscientific methods are used in the analysis of cognitive psychology including studies of perception, memory, comprehension, judgement and ac -
tion, and neuroeconomics is emerging as a new member of the family of neurosciences. 177 PrInCI P lES oF nEUr oSCI EnCE
What are nerves and how do they work?
The human nervous system comprises the central nervous system; the brain and spinal 
cord within the cranium and vertebral spinal canal, and the peripheral nervous system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The nervous system carries signals from sense receptors in skin, ears and other tissues to the cord and brain. It also deliver s motor signals 
from the brain to muscles and glands throughout the body.
The basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron, or nerve cell which transmits 
electrochemical signals as nerve impulses. The human brain is a complex neural network comprising billions of neurons. Neurons are discrete cells but they are linked to one an -
other by synapses, or neural junctions. Nerve impulses travel down neuron fibres as waves of electrical depolarization known as action potentials but are not able to cross synapses between neurons. Instead, the nerve impulses travel from one neuron to the next, trigger -
ing a response in an adjacent neuron.
Neurons have four structural features; dendrites, cell bodies, axons and axon terminals. 
Dendrites are multiple slender fibres which transmit impulses towards the cell body. The cell body is an integration zone where signals in the form of action potentials from many different dendrites are integrated. Axons are fibres that conduct signals from the cell body to axon terminals adjacent to synapses. When a nerve impulse from one neuron arrives at a terminal it triggers the release of a chemical neurotransmitter into the synapse. This at -
taches to the receptors in the dendrites of the next neuron and initiates a nerve impulse (ac -
tion potential) in the postsynaptic neuron. Synapses link axonal fibres to dendrites within a neuronal network, as shown in Figure 11.1, a schematic diagram of a neuronal network.

The neurotransmitters released into synapses can be either excitatory or inhibitory. 
If excitatory, they will promote the ongoing nerve impulse; if inhibitory, they will stop 
it. Different neurotransmitters are associated with different functions, as outlined in Box 11.1. Most synapses in the nervous system release acetylcholine but specific parts 
of the brain use other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, or noradrenaline which affect emotional behaviours  – all of which are important drivers of our behaviour .
Box 11.1 neurotransmitters and hormones
Neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic gap, as explained above. Some of the neu -
rotransmitters and impacts relevant for decision-making include: 
neurotransmitter Imp licated in
Dopamine Reward processing, reward prediction error 
Serotonin Well-being, happiness
Acetylcholine Attention, arousal, reward
Noradrenaline Stress, attention, fight-or-flight impulses
Hormones are chemical messengers secreted from the glands of the endocrine sys -
tem into the blood stream in order to modulate bodily functions. The ones probably 
most interesting to economists include: 
Hormone Implicated in
Oxytocin Trust, social bonding 
Testosterone Risk tolerance, aggression
Cortisol Stress, fear, pain
Some of these substances have a dual function, e.g. oxytocin is a hormone released into the blood stream from endocrine glands and is also a neurotransmitter.
To summarize: signals pass through the neural networks of the brain and cord, mediated 
by a combination of electrochemical impulses modulated by each neuron and by the re -
lease of synaptic neurotransmitters.
anatomy of the brain 
The anatomy of the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves is very complex. The human nervous system can be divided into three structural and functional levels:
1. The higher brain or cerebral cortex.
2. The lower brain and brain stem.
3. The spinal cord and peripheral nerves.
The brain is also divided into lobes including frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal lobes and cerebellum – as illustrated in Figure 11.2. 179 PrInCI P lES oF nEUr oSCI EnCE
The cerebral cortex and the subcortical nuclei are of greatest interest for cognitive 
studies and psychological investigations including those used by neuroeconomists.
It has been estimated that there are approximately 100 billion neurons in a healthy 
human brain. The brain shows regions mainly of two kinds, comprised of either grey 
matter or white matter. 
Grey matter is composed of numerous nerve cell bodies, interconnecting dendrites, 
short axons and supporting cells called neuroglia. It is rich in synapses and very active metabolically requiring a constant supply of glucose and oxygen, so it is well supplied by blood vessels and is highly vascular. The most striking grey-matter region of the human brain is the folded outer covering of the cerebral hemispheres called the cerebral cortex , 
containing six layers of cells and measuring 2 to 5 mm in thickness. 
A prominent cerebral cortex is evolutionarily a feature of mammal brains. If a human 
cortex were unfolded it would cover an area of a quarter of a metre. Packing this into the cranium produces folds, known as convolutions or gyri, with fissures or sulci between them. The two largest cortical fissures on each side are between the temporal and parietal lobes of the cerebrum – the Sylvian fissures, and between the frontal and parietal lobes – the fissures of Rolando. These are important because the motor areas lie in front of, and sensory areas behind, these fissures. The prefrontal lobes are those portions of the frontal lobes that lie in front of the motor areas. 
Grey matter is also present in subcortical areas of the brain, such as basal ganglia, nu -
clei in the brain stem, hind brain and extending into the spinal cord. The limbic system of nerve tracts and nuclei lies closely adjacent to the cortex and includes basal nuclei and tracts connecting with the hypothalamus and the amygdala. FRONTAL LOBEPARIETAL LOBE

Neuroeco Nomics i: pri Nciples
White matter is composed mainly of myelinated long axons which connect different 
regions of the brain and spinal cord. These long axons are coated with a whitish myelin 
sheath which insulates the axon from surrounding neurons and improves transmission of nerve impulses (electrical action potentials). White matter is much less metabolically active than grey matter and so is less vascular.
Given the complex confusion of anatomical structures in the human brain, some 
conventions have emerged to enable identification of specific areas. Korbinian Brodmann devised maps of the cerebral cortex and key neural structures are now often categorized using Brodmann’s areas, some of which are noted below. Often, a neuroscientist will be interested in identifying specific regions of interest (ROIs), for example in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, as explained below. 
Brain areas and functions
Evolutionary biologists focus on the rough division of brain regions reflecting evolu -
tionary development. In these approaches, the brain is divided roughly into three main areas  – the triune division into reptilian, mammalian and hominid parts. The triune ana -
tomical division can be loosely associated with some broad functions: the reptilian parts of the brain are often associated with basic instincts and impulses; the mammalian parts associated with basic perception and social interaction; and the hominid part associated with higher cognitive function (Jerison 1973, MacLean 1990; Camerer et al.  2005). 
As noted above, a prominent cerebral cortex is a feature of mammalian brains and the 
significant enlargement of the cerebral cortex is most developed in hominid brains and the prefrontal cortex is often associated with deliberative thinking in neuroeconomic studies. Reflecting the triune division, some neuroeconomic insights about brain structure reflect evolutionary themes, for example some neuroeconomists postulate that violations of stand -
ard utility theory have been replicated with animals perhaps because behaviour is pro -
pelled by older, less evolved circuitry rather than more highly evolved cognitive structures.
A list of some key brain areas and functions are set out in Box 11.2.
Box 11.2 Some brain areas and functions

Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) Executive function, conflict resolution

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) Planning, cognition 
PFC – Brodmann area 10 Theory of mind, mind reading 
Temporal cortex Memory, recognition, emotion  181 PrInCI P lES oF nEUr oSCI EnCE
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with planning and cognition, the parietal 
lobe with motor action, and the occipital lobe with visual processing, the temporal lobe 
with memory/recognition/emotion. There is also evidence that areas in the PFC are as -
sociated with social cognition, for example Brodmann area 10 in the PFC is associated with ‘mind reading’ and empathy. Limbic structures are associated with emotional be -
haviour, subconscious motivations and sensations of punishment or pleasure. A number of neuroeconomic studies, particularly studies exploring interactions between cognition and emotion, have identified a role for limbic structures, including the amygdala, insula, nucleus accumbens (which forms the main part of the ventral striatum) and the anterior cingulate cortex. The amygdala is implicated in the processing of fear and the insula with pain, disgust, and also social snubs, inequality and unfairness; the anterior cingulate (ACC) performs executive functions and resolves conflicts. Some of these neuroanatomi -
cal structures are identified in Figure 11.3.

Modularity 
Some neuroscientists focus on modularity in the brain – certain functions are associated 
with specific anatomical areas, though many of these functions will interact and over -
lap. The visual system is, perhaps surprisingly, particularly important in decision-making because it is integral to accumulating and processing information and stimulating the motor system to make “winner takes all” binary choices. Areas associated with language, religion and humour have been identified (Camerer et al.  2005). Another area of poten -
tial interest to economists is the mirror system and “mentalizing” modules, activated when observing other persons recreate similar internal states in the observer. Studies have shown that mirror neuron systems in the premotor cortex of monkeys are activated when the monkey makes a movement and are also activated when the monkey observes another 
monkey making the same action. If mirror neurons are responding to internally generated representations of actions and not to the actions themselves, then potentially they are also implicated in sympathetic responses to social situations (Rizzolatti et al.  2002). 
Functions may also be coordinated. In many cases, a number of areas will be im -
plicated in specific neural processes, for example brain imaging studies have identified a distributed network involved in arithmetic reasoning , including  the lateral and ventral 
prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal lobe, and subcortical regions such as  the caudate nu -
cleus and cerebellum. There may be interactions between automatic versus controlled functions and between cognition and affect. Cognition may dominate in “top-down sense-making”, when we use our cognitive powers to fit the world to our expectations, impose order, imagine patterns, miss unexpected changes and overwrite old information . 
This can explain hindsight biases. For example, experimental subjects watched a video of 
basketball passes made by one team. In the video, a gorilla walks on for 40 seconds. One half of the subjects were oblivious to this (Simons and Chabris 1999, cited in Camerer et al.  
2004a). O’Shea (2005) explains that we engage unconsciously in top-down sense, making using of our experience to recognize patterns that, on strictly objective terms, should be unfamiliar. For example, we can see a paragraph in which all the words are jumbled – with only the first and last letter retained in the right place, and still we can understand it. O’Shea illustrates with an example: “I cdnulot blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdgnieg. It deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod aer, the olny ip -
rmoatnt thing is taht eth frist dan lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae…” (O’Shea 2005, p. 7).
neuroscientific data and techniques
Economic decisions and choices can be analysed using a range of neuroscientific tech -
niques including psychopathology, neuroimaging and brain stimulation, physiological measurement and genetic studies, as explored below.
Psychopathology studies
Psychopathology, the study of psychiatric disorders, can be used to make inferences about how the absence of normal function is related to particular neural systems and responses. The sort of abnormalities studied include brain lesions; mania (which leads to more unconventional behaviour if people are ignoring social signals); eating disorders, which link with testoster -
one – associated with risk tolerance; Huntington’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease are associ -
ated with damage to dopamine neurons and reward structures; Alzheimer’s,  associated  with  183 PrInCI P lES oF nEUr oSCI EnCE
loss of memory function; and autism, associated with constraints on empathy, amongst oth -
ers. Insights about depressive illness have also been linked by economists to stock market 
performance, for example Kamstra et al. ’s (2003) and Hirshleifer and Shumway’s (2003) stud -
ies of  the links between stock market performance, seasonal affective disorder and weather 
patterns.
Lesion patient studies analyse the behaviour of patients with lesions to specific brain 
structures in order to make some inferences about the function of that area. If a lesion in a specific area impairs decision-making in particular contexts, then it is inferred that this area is implicated. 
As explored in Chapter 9 in the context of emotions and decision-making, lesion 
patient studies are particularly important to neuroeconomics because early studies by neuroscientists including Antonio Damasio established a link between brain damage and impaired financial decision-making function. He used these insights to develop the so -
matic marker hypothesis asserting that bodily signals guide action. Somatic markers are links between stimuli and somatic (in the body) emotional responses. Emotions become associated with past events and in new situations these learned emotional responses will guide behaviour. Antonio Damasio and colleagues have studied a range of lesions includ -
ing lesions similar to Phineas Gage’s (Damasio et al.  1996). For example, Adolphs et al. ’s 
(1995) study of lesion patients revealed that amygdala lesions were associated with im -
pairments of emotional processing, particularly fear processing. More recently, the amyg -
dala is an area studied by neuroeconomists interested in negative emotional processing in risky situations, for example fear in financial markets, as explored in Chapter 15. 
neurometrics 
Many neuroeconomic studies use neuroscientific techniques to map and measure brain function. Shibasaki (2008) analyses a range of neuroscientific tools used to capture brain activity in conscious subjects, either at rest or when undertaking cognitive tasks. Some, like electroencephalography, are more than 60 years old. In the last ten years, highly sen -
sitive electronic, computer and imaging techniques have improved in accuracy, making non-invasive functional assessments of conscious brains an exciting and expanding area of neuroscience. These techniques can be divided into two groups reflecting different physical aspects of the functioning brain – electrophysiological and haemodynamic.
Electrophysiological methods draw on the fact that neurons transmit nerve impulses 
as electrochemical action potentials. Modern electroencephalography (EEG) can detect cerebral electrical activity (action potentials) as impulses pass to different brain regions. It can do so with great accuracy and with a temporal resolution of milliseconds. Sets of EEG scalp electrodes are easy to apply, subjects are comfortable and the equipment is relatively cheap. However, spatial resolution is poor so it can be difficult to map electrical activity to brain regions precisely.
Magnetoencephalography(MEG) is not dissimilar to EEG but requires a magnetically 
neutral environment which can be difficult to create in a behavioural experimental labo -
ratory. More recently, it has become possible to stimulate brain areas non-invasively, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
Haemodynamic techniques capture blood flows. The brain takes 15% of the blood 
supplied from the heart to the whole body in basal conditions. It uses a disproportion -
ately large amount of energy compared to other organs, to support neuronal and synaptic 184 
Neuroeco Nomics i: pri Nciples
activity, especially in grey-matter areas like the cortex and basal ganglia. Therefore, brain 
activity requires a constant supply of glucose and oxygen to maintain its metabolism. In turn, this  requires an efficient system of arteries, capillaries and veins to provide blood 
at constant pressure and temperature. Reduced cerebral blood flow, low blood oxygen or glucose, and hypothermia quickly lead to loss of consciousness.
Functional brain imaging techniques map either blood flow, glucose and/or oxygen 
usage in different brain regions as experimental subjects are performing specific tasks. The maps can be superimposed on anatomical brain scans to give spatial resolution of active areas. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) depends on the emission of characteristic positron gamma rays from radioactive tracers within the brain. Spe -
cial gamma cameras are needed to detect these gamma rays and radioactive material has to be injected intravenously during the scan. Positron-emitting water (15 oxygen H
2O) can be used to map cerebral blood flow and a positron-emitting glucose analogue 
(18  flu
orine-deoxyglucose) can map areas of markedly increased brain metabolism. PET 
has the advantage that it can make quantitative measurement of activity in specific regions however, whilst it has good spatial resolution its temporal resolution is poor because of the rapid decay of radioactivity. Newer PET compounds, which bind to neurotransmit -
ter receptors, can demonstrate the distribution of serotonin or dopamine in the brain. Though valuable for specific uses, PET is time-consuming, expensive and requires close access to a cyclotron to produce the short-lived positron radioactive tracers. Its use for cognitive studies is therefore limited (Shibasaki 2008).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is another technique designed to 
capture brain activity whilst subjects are engaged in specific tasks. It has developed dra -
matically over the last ten years. It depends upon the physical principle that oxygenated haemoglobin in red blood coming from the lungs is magnetically different to deoxy -
haemoglobin in blue blood whose oxygen has been used up. The change in signal from red to blue blood demonstrates the parts of the brain which are metabolically active and receiving larger amounts of blood oxygen. Functional MR images of the brain are there -
fore blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD). Functional images can be mapped easily onto standard anatomical images of the brain, which can be made in any plane, so that it is easy to identify activity in small brain regions such as the amygdala and hypothalamus as well as localized cortical areas. Functional MRI scans need high field magnets which are expensive, claustrophobic and noisy, so that it is initially difficult for the subject to per -
form cognitive tasks. Also, it can be difficult to interpret the data because a BOLD signal response may be capturing an inhibitory response, not an excitatory response. However, fMRI is safe and does not use X-rays or radioactive tracers, so scans can be repeated.
In brain-imaging studies information is usually communicated visually in the form of 
a brain “map” identifying significant areas based on the average of structural images from all subjects in the sample. An example of an fMRI scan is shown in Figure 11.4
This scan captures fMRI differential activation in the visual cortex in response to a 
complex moving visual stimulus versus a rest condition (viewing a black screen). 
Brain images can also be mapped from the specific plane or perspective of the scan, 
as illustrated in Figure 11.5.
The planes are named using visual associations. The sagittal plane captures the direc -
tion of an arrow flying into the face (from sagitta, the Latin for arrow) and is the vertical plane through or approximately parallel to the nose towards the back of the head. The coronal (=crown) plane slices vertically through the crown of the head from the top of Figure 11.4   An fMRI scan

the skull towards the spine and perpendicular to the tip of the nose. The horizontal or 
axial (=axe) plane is from the front to the back of the head, as if the top of the head has been cut off with an axe. 
Overall, despite their sophistication, brain imaging techniques are not infallible. 
Some critics observe that just because an area of the brain is picked up within a scanner does not mean that it is the primary area responsible for functioning. There may be other areas, systems and processes involved and it can be difficult precisely to attribute causality using some neuroscientific techniques. Choosing which neurometric techniques to use will depend on the questions to be answered and the availability of equipment. For  cog-
nitive psychological studies, such as those used in neuroeconomics, a combination of EEG or MEG studies mapped onto fMRI scans might represent a good compromise in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
Brain stimulation
It is difficult to establish causality with brain imaging techniques but other neurophys -
iological techniques including brain stimulation, are less susceptible to this limitation. Brain areas can also be directly stimulated in a number of ways. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves electromagnetic induction to temporarily activate specific areas of the brain and has been used in neuroeconomics to study empathy and trust (e.g. Baumgartner et al. 2011). The brain can also be studied directly using electrical brain 
stimulation (EBS) – the direct stimulation of neurons using electrodes. EBS studies show that rats and drug addicts will work hard for EBS and will trade other rewards for EBS (Camerer et al. 2005).
Physiological techniques
Psychophysiological measurement includes measurements of involuntary bodily responses including eye movements or “saccades”, heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response (GSR), sweating response, pupil dilation and facial musculature. Neurophysiology can also be used to inform the use of drugs, for example alcohol affects specific neurotrans -
mitter systems associated with stress and reward. Impacts of administering or measuring hormones can also reveal some of the neural correlates of decision-making, as identified by Zak and colleagues in their studies of oxytocin (for example Zak et al. 2005) and by Coates and Herbert in their studies of testosterone and financial risk-taking (for example Coates and Herbert 2008; Herbert 2018) – as we will explore in more depth in Chapter 12
genetic analysis
Economists are increasingly interested in the genetic correlates of behaviour. With the hu -
man genome project, our knowledge of genes and their make-up has grown rapidly, and Blumenthal-Barby et al. (2015) have highlighted how important it is to bring insights from behavioural economics into genetic research. Before then, the main method for testing genetic influences was twin studies, which exploited the fact that some twins are iden -
tical or monozygotic (twins from the same egg and sharing the same DNA) and others are non-identical or dizygotic (from different eggs). When identical twins are separated at birth it is possible to make inferences about the influence of genes versus environment  187 PrInCI P lES oF nEUr oSCI EnCE
according to differences later in life. There are limitations with twin studies however, 
and the perennial question of whether to attribute these differences to nature or nurture remains unresolved. 
With the human genome project, it became possible to investigate the genetic cor -
relates of behaviour in a lot more depth and to link phenotypes and polymorphisms, including individual characteristics such as personality traits and risk preferences , with a 
person’s genotype or genetic make-up. Another way to correlate behaviour with genetic information is via gene “heat maps” which capture the level of gene expression. Geno -
types determine the level of gene expression and give rise to phenotypes depending on the level of gene expression and gene heat maps pick up the level of expression of genes, for example by linking features of DNA with observed behaviour such as risk-taking. Studies have also been done linking genotypes to neural activations. Haynes finds that variability in risk preferences is  associated with particular genotypes which, in turn, are 
associated with differences in amygdala activation (Haynes 2011).
What is neuroeconomics? 
Now that we have set out some of the relevant principles and techniques from neuro -
science, we can start to explore how neuroscience and economics come together in the relatively novel sub-discipline called neuroeconomics .
Neuroeconomics brings neuroscientific tools and insights together with behavioural 
economics. As a discipline, it has emerged from recognition by behavioural economists and economic psychologists that cognition and perception amongst real people does not 
fit the strict model of rational behaviour, especially when perception does not match an objective reality. The problem can be to establish an objective scientific basis for cognition and perception and neuroeconomics offers a solution. Whilst behavioural economics is distinct and perhaps less controversial than the growing field of neuroeconomics, neuro -
economics is, in essence, a development of behavioural economics but one which focuses (largely) on insights and techniques from positivist, objective analyses of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Some would argue that the approach is too reductionist – human behaviour is more complex than can be captured just by studying brain function; others argue that neuroeconomics isn’t really economics, as explored in the controversies section below.
Camerer et al. (2004a, 2005) give some good early surveys of the essential ideas, tools 
and techniques. Neuroeconomics applies the tools, insights and findings from neuro -
science and biological psychology to the analysis of economic decision-making. It is an eclectic approach combining and extending methods from behavioural and experimental economics with those from neuroscience and psychology, including experimental, evolu -
tionary, cognitive, ecological and social psychology.
neuroeconomic data
Neuroeconomics offers an answer to the economist William Stanley Jevons’ scepticism about capturing feelings. Neuroeconomics offers methods of measurement – blunt ones, admittedly, at this stage, but as techniques increase in sophistication finer measurement will become easier (Camerer et al . 2005; Camerer 2007). Rustichini (2005a,b) agrees that 
neuroeconomics provides new data and methods to test useful predictions about various 188 
Neuroeco Nomics i: pri Nciples
aspects of economic behaviour including incentives, preferences and feasibility con -
straints, and to explain deviations from the axiomatic theory of subjective expected utility.
Neuroscience offers alternative objective  methods of measurement. Money as a measure 
has limitations: it has its own utility and various neuroscientific studies have shown that 
it is directly rewarding in itself, which raises the question of how to separate the utility of money from the utility of the things that money buys. Studying neural responses can illuminate questions of value that may be less prone to some of the contradictions implicit in using monetary measures of value. 
Neuroscientific measurement is also more direct and therefore more reliable than 
self-report (Camerer et al.  2005). Neuroeconomics can identify empirical links between 
games and choices and can provide more insight than revealed preference theory provides. 
Neuroscientific techniques can add precision because knowing the neural mecha -
nisms helps to explain the behaviour. For example, the  fact that raising oxytocin “exoge -
nously” increases trustworthy behaviour enhances our understanding of how hormones affect moods and behaviour. The recognition in neuroscience that choices are not prede -
termined, and that biological states affect choices, deepens our understanding of choices especially as choices do not necessarily reflect preference.
Neuroscience can also deepen our understanding by identifying when the same brain 
circuitry is involved in apparently distinct economic and financial decisions. If there is a common neural correlate, then this may reflect the fact that similar systems are engaged in different types of decisions. For example, the insula is activated when people feel that they have been treated unfairly in experimental games. It is also activated with ambiguous gambles and with poor strategic thinking. Some common mechanism may be unifying seemingly distinct behaviours.
Whilst the prospects for neuroeconomics and its tools may look promising, it is none-
theless important to recognize the limitations. The field is young. Tools are new and rel -
atively crude. Just because we can measure neural activations does not necessarily imply that we can directly measure thoughts and feelings (Huang 2005).
neuroeconomic models and theories
Whilst neuroscientific tools offer neuroeconomists new measurement methods, neuroe -
conomics offers more than a toolkit. It may help us to understand the links between brain and economic behaviour. Neuroeconomists emphasize, in particular, the importance of consilience and dual systems thinking, as explained below.
Consilience
Consilience represents the fact that neuroeconomics is an eclectic approach bringing neu-
roscience together with economics, evolutionary psychology, cognitive psychology, be -
havioural psychology/ecology and social psychology to form a general theory of human behaviour, possibly allowing the development of a unified approach. Glimcher (2011) and Glimcher and Rustichini (2004) envisage neuroeconomics as a unifying mathematical the -
ory. Economics brings the analytical structure of decision theory, psychology brings the deeper understanding of cognition and emotion, and neurobiology the study of mechanism. Similarly, Camerer et al. (2004a, 2005) suggest that neuroeconomics has the power to unite apparently disparate subjects: “Anthropologists emphasise acculturation.  Psychologists  189 PrInCI P lES oF nEUr oSCI EnCE
emphasise cognition and contexts. Sociologists emphasise social norms and constraints. 
[Most] Economists emphasise rationality. Neuroscience has the power to unify them all” Camerer et al. (2005).
Glimcher, Dorris and Bayer (2005) focus on understanding how the neural archi -
tecture generates decisions. Just as neuroscience can illuminate economic questions, economics gives ideas and theories for neuroscience, for example the insights from mi -
croeconomics and game theory about models of strategic thinking, mixed strategy equi -
librium and subjective expected utility theory. Overall, Glimcher et al. (2005) conclude that is a two-way exchange filling important gaps: economists have overly simplistic views of brain function; neuroscientists have underestimated the complexity of human 
 de
cision-making. Unifying economics and neuroscience may provide better answers if 
the disciplines can engage in effective dialogue. 
Empathy and theory of mind
In developing these theories, one  theme that receives a lot of attention in neuroeconom -
ics is the role of empathy in economic decision-making, and this links to literatures on social motivations and models from behavioural game theory, as well as theories of so -
cial influence, as explored in Chapter 8. A key concept in these models is the concept of theory of mind (ToM). ToM involves making inferences about the beliefs, feelings and action of others (Frith and Frith 2003; Camerer et al.  2005). ‘Mentalizing’ involves guessing what 
others will do. Social emotions such as empathy play a role in theory of mind. Theory of mind may be associated with a special “mentalizing” area controlling reasoning about others’ beliefs and actions are associated with increased activation in Brodmann area 10 when playing games involving trust, cooperation and punishment (McCabe et al.  2001). 
Autistic patients are thought to have deficits in Brodmann area 10 and about a quarter of autistic adults offer nothing in ultimatum games, perhaps because of empathetic de -
ficiencies ( Sally and Hill 2006). There is also evidence that cognitive control has evolved 
within a social context. Research shows that human children and chimpanzees use sim -
ilar cognitive skills when dealing with physical tasks but human children have more sophisticated cognitive skills when dealing with social tasks, including social learning and theory of mind (Herrmann et al.  2007).
A lot of economic action, especially in a strategic context, involves mentalizing. Sim -
ilarly, empathetic behaviour may lead to herding and imitation when people make de -
cisions on the basis of mentalizing responses and there is some experimental evidence to support this. Singer and Fehr (2005) argue that mentalizing and empathizing explain people’s responses to situations involving incomplete information. Singer et al.  (2004) re -
veal that empathizing with the pain of others activates areas associated with the affective processing of pain. They also confirmed that individual differences can play a role. They found heterogeneity in empathetic abilities across people. 
It is possible that humans have a “mirror system” that helps us to understand the ac -
tions of others and the analysis of mirror mechanisms parallels elements of the analysis of sympathy and empathy in Adam Smith’s (1759) Theory of Moral Sentiments  (Sugden 2005). 
There are different conceptions of sympathy: Smithian sympathy draws on insights from The Theory of Moral Sentiments , especially ideas about the role played by feeling sympathy in 
ensuring societal stability. Introspection in games can also be explained in terms of sym -
pathy: sympathy allows the individual introspectively to consider the actions of others.190 
Neuroeco Nomics i: pri Nciples
Experiments on monkey imitation show that monkeys’ socialized instincts are pro -
pelled by the activity of mirror neurons. These ideas have been extended to describe 
human instincts to follow others as the outcome of mirror neuron activity (Rizzolatti et al. 
2002; Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; Iacoboni 2005) though analysis of the role played by the mirror system in a human context is limited by the fact that the single neuron exper -
iments required to verify mirror neuron theories cannot easily be conducted on human subjects for ethical reasons. Rustichini (2005a) focuses in particular on sympathy, draw -
ing on ideas from neuroscience about mirror neuron systems, as explored above. Sympa -
thy is an affective state but it is also sophisticated, not naïve (see also Glimcher et al.  2005). 
Dual systems thinking
Neuroeconomic theories make an important general contribution to economic theory in offering alternative ways of modelling behaviour that are less dependent on the strict, monolithic versions of rationality seen in standard mainstream approaches. Neuroscience is not dependent on simple distinction between rational and irrational – a limitation that has in many senses plagued the development of economic theory. Glimcher uses a metaphor of a clockwork digesting duck, constructed by 18th-century French inventor Jacques de Vaucanson. Glimcher observes that mainstream economics often assumes that we process information as if we are mathematical machines, as if we were Vaucanson’s clockwork duck (Glimcher, 2003). In reality, human cognition is more complex. 
One way to capture this complexity is to take a multiple systems approach focus -
ing on the insight that the brain is composed of different interacting systems. Some neuroeconomic analyses take Plato’s metaphor from classical philosophy. Behaviour is like a chariot pulled by two horses of appetite and spirit, guided by the “charioteer” of reason (Glimcher 2003). Neuroeconomics abandons the strict dichotomy between the rational and the irrational, for example neuroscientists recognize the important role played by emotions in guiding decisions, an issue explored in the context of Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis (Damasio 1994/2006). Overall, neuroeconomics presents a model of the interconnected mind in which choices are not strictly dichotomous and the world is not understood in terms of black and white. Rather, there are shades of grey as different functions and areas interact and interconnect. The brain is not just the sum of its parts. 
Daniel Kahneman – whose work with Amos Tversky on heuristics, bias and prospect 
theory forms an important foundation for behavioural economics, as we explored in Chapters 3 and 4 – sets out some important insights about how cognition and emotion 
come together. Kahneman’s cognitive maps are a development of his collaborations with Tversky on heuristics and biases (e.g. Tversky and Kahneman 1974) and prospect theory (e.g. Kahneman and Tversky 1979). If behaviour is strictly rational in a standard economic sense, then fast thinking in the form of heuristics has no place and biases are ruled out. 
Dual-system models: System 1 versus System 2 thinking
These ideas from Kahneman form the foundation for his influential analyses of System 1 versus System 2 thinking. Kahneman’s structure of how different thinking systems interact links to Romer’s (2000) distinctions between decisions based on thoughts and  191 DUal S YS tEM S tHInkIng
decisions  based on feeling. Kahneman draws on early psychological analyses of sys -
tems thinking – including interactions between cognition and emotion, and between 
controlled versus automatic systems. Schneider and Shiffrin (1977) Stanovich and West (2000) . Building on his maps of bounded rationality in Kahneman (2003), Kahneman 
(2011) maps a structure for thinking processes which blends elements that fit relatively well with standard economic conceptions of rationality with emotional drivers to set out an architecture of thinking systems. Kahneman (2003) maps the brain into two different brain systems: System 1 (automatic, quick, intuitive) and System 2 (cognitive, deliberative, controlled). There are different systems for emotion and deliberation and these are associated with automatic versus controlled processing. Emotions are the low-level physiological processes that rapidly elicit stereotyped and valenced behavioural responses, 
 en
gaging different neural structures than those engaged during cognitive 
processing.  Sa
nfey et al. (2006) also argue that economic behaviour can be understood 
in terms  of “dual  pro
cess models”  which make a distinction between emotion and 
deliberation.
The essence of each system is that System 2 is about thinking via reasoning and Sys -
tem 1 is about deciding via intuition. System 1 includes cognitive operations which are spontaneous, effortless and fast. They operate automatically and are often affected by emotions and habit. System 1 processing is not deliberative in nature and this, together with the impact of emotions and visceral influences, means that System 1 operations are difficult to control. System 2 processes are effortful and rule-governed. They reflect deliberation and control and, whilst they operate more slowly than System 1 processes – because they are the outcome of careful conscious thought, they are more flexible and adaptable. Automatic functions are quicker and therefore more neurologically efficient. Controlled functions are slower but more deliberative and careful. On a basic level there will be primacy of affect: “affect gets there first” because affective systems are designed to ensure survival and therefore evolve in response to selection pressures. Emotions and visceral factors will play varying roles depending on the level of emotional intensity. At low levels of emotional intensity, affect is advisory. At medium levels, conscious conflict is resolved via effort (e.g. self-control). At high levels, affect is overpowering. However, in the battle between affect and cognition, the winner takes all and whether the winner is affect or cognition will be determined by the context.
The interactions between these different systems is not a manifestation of irration -
ality: emotional and cognitive systems can operate together and emotional systems may have evolved as effective adaptations to past environments and circumstances. Insights about these interacting systems are important in understanding choices and behaviour. There will be coordination of affect and cognition reflecting the inter -
action of different neural areas in economic decision-making. For example, lesions to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are  associated with dampened emotional re -
sponses, for example in card gambles, perhaps because the coordination of affective and cognitive processes has been disconnected (Bechara et al. 1997). Other evidence 
that emotional and cognitive systems interact is seen in social decision-making. When people feel that they have been treated unfairly, this creates conflicts between cog -
nition and emotion. Neural tussles have also been observed in brain imaging stud -
ies of inter-temporal and social decision-making, as we will explore in Chapter 12. Specifically, in neuroeconomic analyses of decision-making, dual systems approaches 192 
Neuroeco Nomics i: pri Nciples
have been developed to  reflect emotional intensity in economic decision-making, 
for example Bernheim and Rangel’s models of “hot” versus “cold” systems in ad -
diction, and Brocas and Carillo’s (2008) conception of the brain as a dual system 
prone to  co
nflicts in the face of asymmetric information, impatience and misaligned 
incentives . 
Cognition dominates with effortful cognition and studies show that emotional reac -
tions can be blocked by deliberative thinking. Experiments exploring students’ preferences for posters have shown that students will appreciate the posters on their walls less if they’ve had to think too carefully about why they like them; emotions will affect memory and dominate cognitive processes in wishful thinking (Wilson and Schooler 1991; Camerer et al. 2004a, 2005; Urry et al.  2006). Also, cognition often dominates in perception in top-
down sense-making. We fit the world into our expectations of it, sometimes imagining order where there is none and missing unexpected changes (Camerer et al.  2005). 
Dual systems: evolutionary influences
Why have these dual systems evolved? Evolutionary themes are particularly relevant to 
 du
al-systems models  and neuroscience more generally too. They can explain why the 
instinctive affective system interacts with the deliberative cognitive system. Human be -
haviour is often a compromise between highly evolved animal emotions and instincts and more recently evolved human deliberation and foresight (Loewenstein 1996). Dual systems can also be understood in evolutionary terms by analysing which areas of the brain are associated with specific functions – linking to the insights about the evolution of brain structures, as introduced earlier in this chapter. Higher-level, recently evolved cognitive functions are more general and flexible and are used in reasoning and planning. These may be a “critical substrate for the standard economic conception of a rational ‘ homo 
economicus’” (Cohen 2005). Cohen also postulates that increased capacity for reason and control was associated with the development of specific areas of the brain, in particular the prefrontal cortex, and this reflected adaptations to profound changes in the social as well as physical characteristics of human environments. 
Ironically, this may have generated social and evolutionary instability because ancient 
emotional responses were less well-adapted to modern conditions than ancient environ -
ments: the development of technologies may have accelerated the maladaptation of old emotional processes. For example, limbic structures in the brain are often associated with impulsive emotional responses and these may have been appropriate in a world in which immediate rewards were important. In primitive environments, basic resources were scarce and perishable and so quick, instinctive action was essential to avoid starvation; but in a modern context, these instincts may not serve a useful purpose and may in fact gener -
ate perverse behaviour such as addiction. Cohen argues that more recently evolved areas of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, have developed to interact effectively with older structures in circumstances in which our emotional mechanisms are not well-suited. In this way, we can override inappropriate emotional responses using control and reasoning. Evolution has “vulcanized” the brain, increasing its strength and resilience. Reason and control have balanced primitive emotional responses, for example by allowing humans to develop pre-commitment devices such as savings plans and nicotine gum, to moderate the influence of impulsive, self-destructive emotional decision-making

hen 2005). 193 DUal S YS tEM S tHInkIng
Dual systems thinking in neuroeconomic analyses
A number of neuroeconomic models and theories develop the idea that economic de -
cisions can be explained in terms of dual systems processing, focusing on the neural 
correlates of interactions between deliberative/cognitive and automatic/affective systems (e.g. see Camerer 2007; Camerer et al.  2004a, 2005; Rustichini 2005a,b; Loewenstein and 
O’Donoghue 2004). Also, Glimcher and Rustichini (2004) focus on the dual roles of emotion and reason as manifested in the consilience of economic and neuroscientific approaches to decision-making. Frith and Singer (2008) develop ideas about the interac -
tion of reason and emotion in a socio-economic context. When social motivations and emotions compete, they propel our sense of fairness, altruistic punishment, trust and framing  effects. 
Distinguishing between automatic emotional systems and deliberative cognitive sys -
tems is also an essential theme in neuroeconomics, particularly in neuroeconomic anal -
yses of emotional processing. Concepts from neuroscience can be used to capture these interacting neural systems and to reconcile emotional versus cognitive and controlled versus automatic processes (Camerer 2007; Camerer et al.  2004a, 2005; Cohen 2005):
The neuroeconomic theory of individual replaces the (perennially useful) fiction of 
a utility maximising individual which has a single goal, with a more detailed account of how components of the individual – brain regions, cognitive control, and neural 
 cir
cuits  – interact and communicate to determine individual behaviou r.
(Camerer 2007)
~
The main lesson to be taken from this chapter is that psychology and neuroscience have a 
lot to offer in extending economists’ understanding of these influences. Interdisciplinary approaches bringing together psychology, neuroscience and economics remain contro -
versial amongst economists, however. Whilst neuroeconomics as a discipline is growing rapidly, it has confronted significant scepticism, particularly initially. Perhaps this reflects the fact that economists used to working with abstract, parsimonious mathematical mod -
els regard neuroeconomics as rather too alien and quirky in its approach. Some econo -
mists working within a standard approach argue that embedding a deeper understanding of what underlies observable choices and decisions is an anathema. For them, the focus should be on objectively measurable data and for many mainstream economists this is observed choice. 
This point is debatable however, especially as the increasing sophistication of neuro -
scientific techniques means that simple choices are no longer the only phenomena which can be measured objectively. There is an enormous, highly regarded neuroscientific liter -
ature on decision-making. Neuroeconomists are just drawing parallels between the neural responses seen whilst people are making economic choices with established neuroscientific evidence about what people are doing when making other sorts of choices. Neuroscien -
tists have established that rewards such as food, addictive substances, and so on, activate dopamine pathways . It is not such a leap to infer that money, as a reward, is activating sim -
ilar pathways, allowing neuroeconomists  (carefully) to consider similar inferences about 
making money that a neuroscientist might make about eating food. At their best,  models 194 
Neuroeco Nomics i: pri Nciples
and data collection techniques from neuroscience allow us rigorously and scientifically to 
test hypotheses about the cognitive and/or emotional decision-making systems implicated in economic decision-making.
Gul and Pesendorfer (2008) make a case for “mindless economics”, justifying ap -
proaches that treat the brain as a black box and concentrate just on observed choices. They criticize (their perception of) the focus in neuroeconomics on physiology and psychol -
ogy and neglect of utility and choice. Ironically, this seems essentially to be a normative  
critique from a positivist  perspective. There are  neuroeconomists, and an increasing number 
of them. Are Gul and Pesendorfer saying that there shouldn’t  be? Camerer (2008) responds 
by making a case for “mindful economics” justifying the role of non-choice data in devel -
oping analytical models of choice. He illustrates with a range of examples and argues that boundaries between disciplines do not need to be as sharp as Gul and Pesendorfer suggest. 
In resolving some of these tensions, Glimcher (2011) observes that neuroscience 
and economics can appear to have little in common because they focus on different “
 pr
imitives”: the primitives in neuroscience are brain activations, neurons and synapses; 
primitives in economics include choice, preference and utility. Links between them can be forged however because, potentially at least, there are common elements, for example neural activations in the medial prefrontal cortex can link choice to expected utility. Be -
haviour is the unifying phenomenon.  Neuroeconomists are starting to make some inroads 
with approaches that combine the primitives from the difference disciplines, for example Fehr and Rangel’s (2011) analyses of the links between choice, experienced utility and neural responses. There is significant added value to be found in combining theoretical and empirical insights from neuroscience, psychology and economics.
Caplin and Dean (2008b) also defend neureconomics against Gul and Pesendorfer’s 
critique which they interpret as having two elements: first, the assertion that economic models are only designed to illuminate choice and so data which is not about choices is not a good test of economic models; and second, the assertion that economists are inter -
ested in choice and so won’t be interested in models that cannot be differentiated on the basis of choice data. 
Caplin and Dean argue against this conception of neuroeconomics via a couple of 
illustrations. First, in models of information search, any set of choice data can be recon -
ciled using a simple model of information search. Standard models cannot differentially capture observed choices. On the other hand, a behavioural model incorporating in -
consistencies and biases from behavioural economics can discriminate different choices. Second, Schultz et al. ’s (1997) analysis of reward prediction error can be used to construct 
an objective neuroeconomic model of choice. Dopamine neurons encode reward which can be linked to utility and thus to a model of choice. 
Neuroeconomic models of reward prediction error from Schultz onwards provide 
the basis for testable predictions about choice. Also, many economists from a range of perspectives would probably agree that an economist should not be forced exclusively to focus on observed choices, especially as neuroscientific techniques are developing to enable objective measurement of the physiological processes propelling decision-making. If economics is to be useful, understanding that the same choices may be propelled by different factors is important. Adjusting an example from Romer (2000) and Camerer et 
al. (2005), if I offer someone a peanut and they choose not to take one, it is important 
that I know whether their choice merely reflects a dislike of peanuts versus the knowledge  195 rEVISI on q UE StIo nS
that it will induce a life-threatening allergic reaction. The difference is important. Just 
observing choices, as is the tradition in mainstream economics, misses out important information that could guide us in making good decisions. Data from neuroeconomic experiments can start to fill these gaps. 
Unifying scientific disciplines does have a better historical pedigree than Gul and 
Pesendorfer admit. Other disciplines also have more in common than their separation into silos might imply. Glimcher (2011) notes the development of consilience between chemistry and biology in the early 20th century. Also, whilst there has always been an objective link between our physiology and the physics of the material world around us, historically, physicists and medical physicians operated independently until the develop -
ment of medical technologies, particularly imaging technologies, enabled the integration of physics and medicine ( H. Baddeley 2008). So the path of scientific analysis can and does 
change as research technologies evolve. Similarly, as the techniques for monitoring our neural responses improve we will be able to link economic decision-making with brain function and that will allow us properly to break down the barriers between economics and neuroscience. 
Chapter summary
 •Neuroeconomics brings together insights from neuroscience and economics to con -
struct a transdisciplinary subject, i.e. a subject that blends together different insights from existing subjects into a whole new subject.
 •Economics contributes an analytical structure around which insights from neurosci -
ence can be tested.
 •Neuroscience contributes tools and techniques for the measurement of neural acti -
vations during economic and financial decision-making, opening the “black box” of the brain so that economists no longer have to rely just on observed choices for evidence.
 •There are a wide range of techniques used – the most well-known is probably neu -
roimaging but there are a number of other techniques too, varying in expense and sophistication.
 •Theoretical insights from neuroscience have also been used to enhance economists’ models – especially by analysing emotions more comprehensively in multiple-system models.

Evidence
How do neuroeconomists use neuroscientific tools to explore what drives our 
 de
cision-making? In the previous chapters, we set out some of the techniques that neu -
roscientists use, and the links between insights from neuroscience and economics. How 
useful are these insights in practice? Neuroeconomics can do much to unravel how our brains process complex decisions – especially when we are faced with conflicts between cognitive and emotional influences. To illustrate some of the ways in which neuroecono -
mists explore these themes, in this chapter we will outline some case studies – including neuroeconomic analyses of prospect theory, time inconsistency, addiction, learning, so -
cial preferences and social emotions.
neuroeconomic analyses of prospect theory
As we saw in Chapter 4, reference points are a key element of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory and some neuroeconomic studies have focused on the neural activations associated with reference points. In these studies, insights from neuroscience can be em -
bedded into the analysis to improve our understanding of some of these characteristics of decision-making under risk, as explored in prospect theory. Using biological/physio -
logical metaphors and physiological principles, Kahneman and Tversky argue that, phys -
iologically, we are adapting all the time to change. Biologically, homeostasis, the internal bodily equilibrium, is the reference point. Generally, physiological responses are a con -
cave function reflecting diminishing marginal responses. If we hold our hand in cold wa -
ter, for example, then the initial impact on our comfort of a degree change in temperature is likely to be large. As the water gets warmer, however, our comfort will increase at a de -
creasing rate, at least until the shape of our utility function shifts again, for example when the water temperature starts to approach boiling point. Feelings of pleasure and pain reflect departures from the homeostatic setpoint. Perception adjusts to restore homeostasis via a process of alliesthaesia – the temporary distortion of preferences which occurs as the body attempts to restore equilibrium, for example placing a hand in warm water feels good when it’s cold weather but uncomfortable in very hot weather (Camerer et al.  2004a, 
2005). Overall, biological principles of homeostasis and alliesthesia reflect the fact that  197 nEU roECono MI C an alYSE S oF tIM E InConSI StEnC Y
perceptions are relative and Kahneman and Tverksy argue that the same principles apply 
to people’s evaluation of monetary changes. Economic choices are driven by changes in the same way that perception and judgement are driven by changes. Kahneman and Tver -
sky are saying that a similar phenomenon affects thinking and 
 de
cision-making which 
means that changes are more important than levels.
Other neuroeconomic analyses of prospect theory have analysed the evolutionary 
roots of decision-making by exploring the behaviour of our close relatives. Chen et al.  
(2006) examine the behaviour of capuchin monkeys exploring whether or not they be -
have according to the law of demand and also assessing the degree of reference depend -
ence and loss aversion in their choices. The capuchins were given a fiat currency in the form of coin-like disks which they were conditioned to associate with food rewards; they could exchange these coins for rewards. They found that the capuchins did adjust their purchases to wealth and price shocks and, in this, the capuchins’ behaviour fitted with standard economic models.
However, when the information was framed in terms of gains and losses, the capu -
chin monkeys’ choices exhibited signs of reference dependence and loss aversion, as pre -
dicted by prospect theory. They chose gambles in which payoffs were framed as gains but rejected gambles in which payoffs were framed as losses – even though the actual payoffs were identical in both scenarios. A similar study identified a reflection effect. When pre -
sented with a potential gain in terms of food rewards, the monkeys preferred to avoid risk but when facing a potential loss they were more prepared to gamble and take risks (Santos and Chen 2009). The fact that monkeys and humans behave in similar ways suggests that some common evolutionary mechanisms underlie behaviour in both species.
Windmann et al. (2006) studied the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in standard and in -
verted form. For the standard IGT, subjects are presented with decks of cards and each time they pick a card they usually win a small reward but for some cards they incur a punishment. The decks are constructed so that there are some bad decks (incurring a net loss in the long run) and some good decks (awarding a net gain in the long run). Normal subjects usually learn to identify the good decks reasonably quickly. Windmann et al.  stud-
ied subjects playing the standard IGT (in which good decks involved taking small constant rewards to avoid large punishments ) and also an inverted IGT ( in which the good decks 
involved taking large constant punishments for large rewards).
They used fMRI to capture activations and identified asymmetries in orbitofrontal 
cortex activations. For the inverted IGT incorporating large constant punishments to ob -
tain large rewards, orbitofrontal cortex activations, associated with emotional processing of reward, were greater for the rewards than punishments. In some cases, for the standard IGT, the activations were reversed with differential orbitofrontal activations for rewards versus punishments. This suggests similar value responses for rewards in the inverted IGT and punishments in the standard IGT and this result is consistent with the S-shaped form of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory value function, as illustrated in Chapter 4 in Figure 4.2.
neuroeconomic analyses of time inconsistency
We set out the key principles of different behavioural models of time discounting in Chapter 7, and some of the key principles from these models of time inconsistency can 198 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
be captured using neuroeconomic analyses. In this context, neuroeconomists have used a 
series of brain imaging studies – though the findings from these studies can be interpreted in different ways, as we shall see.
One of the seminal neuroscientific studies of choices over time is McClure et al . (2004). 
They look at fMRI evidence on the neural correlates of time discounting. Experimental subjects were offered a series of monetary reward choices varying by delay to delivery. 
McClure et al. test for the involvement of two separate neural systems: first, the limbic sys -
tem including the midbrain dopamine system, particularly the paralimbic cortex which is preferentially activated for decisions involving immediately available rewards; second, the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activated for all inter-temporal choices (irrespective of delay). They find greater relative activation of fronto-parietal cor -
tex when subjects choose longer-term options.
In constructing their analysis, they draw on one of Aesop’s fables – the story of the ant 
and the grasshopper. The ant works hard all summer long collecting food for the winter whilst the grasshopper sings away the summer amusing himself. This fable illustrates the conflict between impulsive desires to consume now versus recognizing the future benefits of patience. As explained above, existing evidence shows large discrepancies be -
tween time discounting in humans versus other species. There is limited evidence that other animals make inter-temporal choices deliberatively (according to McClure et al. ). 
Consumers behave impatiently today but are prepared to plan for the future: if given the choice between $10 today and $11 tomorrow, most choose the former; but given a choice between $10 in a year and $11 in a year and a day, most choose the latter. As introduced in Chapter 7, this generates dynamic inconsistency: inter-temporal choices are not dis -
counted exponentially and rewards available in the immediate future are valued dispro -
portionately consistent with impulsive preference reversals
In terms of background neuroeconomic evidence, lesion patient studies show dam -
age to the prefrontal cortex is associated with more impulsive behaviour. As explained in 
 Ch
apter 7, quasi-hyperbolic discounting functions that splice together two different 
discounting functions by incorporating the present bias parameter β into an exponential 
discounting specification provides a good fit to experimental data. McClure et al . develop 
this approach to assess the role of different neural systems involved in inter-temporal decision-making. They set out their 
β δ− model following Phelps and Pollack (1968) and 
Laibson (1997). The present discounted value of a future reward is equal to the standard discount factor multiplied by the present bias parameter 
β. This means that more immedi -
ately available rewards are valued relatively highly. Their neuroeconomic evidence shows how the discrepancy between short-run and long-run preferences reflects differential ac -
tivation of distinguishable neural systems and they hypothesize that distinct neural pro -
cesses are interacting in the following way: short-run impatience is associated with a beta  
system and is mediated by limbic structures; long-run patience is associated with a delta  sys-
tem and is mediated by the lateral prefrontal cortex and associated structures – with higher cognitive functions associated with evaluation of trade-offs between abstract rewards.
They test their hypothesis using an fMRI imaging study in which they scan par -
ticipants making inter-temporal choices between early and later monetary rewards. Immediate rewards activate the beta areas, that is, the classic limbic structures as -
sociated with the midbrain dopamine system – including the ventral striatum, me -
dial orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, also implicated in processing  199 nEU roECono MI C an alYSE S oF tIM E InConSI StEnC Y
reward  expectation/delivery. Choices involving delayed rewards, that is, the delta sys -
tem, are associated with activations in the lateral prefrontal cortex and also in the 
primary visual and motor cortices. These delta areas were differentially activated for longer-term choices but not for more immediate rewards. As expected, visual/motor cortices were activated, as in most decisions.
McClure et al. also screened delta areas for the difficulty of tasks by comparing acti -
vations when the inter-temporal differences in monetary amounts were relatively small and so harder to process. They identified differential activations in the frontal and parietal 
 cor
tex – areas implicated with higher-level cognitive functioning. This is consistent with 
findings about the role of the prefrontal cortex in deliberation and the parietal cortex in mathematical processing. They also found significant activations of the inferior parietal cortex and this is an area also engaged during numerical processing.
Their interpretation draws on insights from evolutionary biology and suggests that 
inter-temporal decision-making in humans, our unique capacity to postpone reward, is associated with higher cognitive functioning engaging the delta system. Overall, 
 in
ter-temporal choice is the outcome of competition between lower-level, automatic pro -
cesses reflecting evolutionary environmental adaptations (engaging the beta system) and 
a more recently evolved, uniquely human capacity for abstract planning (engaging the delta system).
Glimcher et al. (2007) present an alternative neuroeconomic interpretation to McClure 
et al. They analyse hyperbolic/quasi-hyperbolic discounting and agree with McClure et al.  
that it gives a better understanding of inter-temporal choice than exponential discount -
ing models but reject McClure et al. ’s 
β δ− model arguing that inter-temporal decision-  
ma
king is not the outcome of an intra-personal conflict between a patient’s long-term self 
and an impulsive short-term self.
They conduct two experiments. For their first experiment, they use ten human sub -
jects, making 576–720 binary inter-temporal choices between payments with different waiting times. The responses were used to construct individuals’ indifference curves and Glimcher et al.  (2007) found that these were consistent with hyperbolic discounting. 
 Gl
imcher et al. arranged payment via debit cards because these are nationally accepted, 
it is easy to monitor consumption with debit card information and transaction costs are negligible. One set of data was for three behavioural sessions per subject each offered  144 
choices between certain, immediate gain of $20 versus a larger gain but with a delay of be -
tween six hours and six months. They scanned 1–2 additional sessions in a brain scanner.
From the behavioural sessions, they identified the amount of money at which each 
subject was indifferent versus an immediate reward of $20. Hyperbolic discount func -
tions gave a better fit for these choices. They found considerable variation, up to an order of magnitude in rates of discounting between the most patient and most impatient sub -
ject. They used their estimates of the discount function to calculate the discounted utility of each delayed option for each subject. This was correlated with brain activation and they found clear correlation between estimates of discounted utility and brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum (associated with processing reward) and the posterior cingulate cortex. But they found no evidence of differential activation in the beta areas identified by McClure et al.
Glimcher et al. conducted another experiment to investigate further. They used the 
same design as for their first experiment but with a 60-day front-end delay to prevent 200 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
impulsive decision-making. The results from both the behavioural and scanning data 
were the same as for their first experiment showing significant activations in the ven -
tral striatum and anterior/posterior cingulate cortex but no differential activation in the limbic system. Immediate, potentially impulsive choices were no more hyperbolic than choices involving delayed rewards of at least 60 days. Contrary to McClure et al. ’s findings, 
they argue that their  study does not support the hypothesis that discount functions are 
the product of multiple selves within the human brain. Glimcher et al.  argue that dynamic 
inconsistency is not about impulsiveness, it’s about getting things as soon as possible – perhaps reflecting temptation rather than impatience. More generally, they argue that neurobiology is most useful in helping us to understand the revealed preference approach in terms of the algorithmic structure of the brain.
neuroeconomic analyses of addiction
In Smith and Tasnádi’s (2007) study , presented in Chapter 8 , they emphasized the role of 
dopaminergic pathways. They also noted that insula plays a role in conscious feeling by anticipating bodily effects of emotional events so the insula may play a role in propelling addiction by anticipating the bodily effects of addictions such as smoking. Animal studies show that addiction in rats resembles human addiction and this suggests that human ad -
diction is propelled by primitive reward circuitry engaging the dopaminergic pathways. Evolution may also play a role, raising the question: do addictive substances hijack primi -
tive reward circuitry to create phenomena of reinforcement, tolerance, craving and with -
drawal? There have been a range of neuroeconomic studies of addiction which illuminate some of these issues.
naqvi et al. ’ s lesion patient study
McClure et al. (2004) (whose study of the neural correlates of time inconsistency we’ve ex -
plored above also ) make the connection between present bias and addiction. Immediacy, 
impulsivity and drug addiction lead to similar activations of dopaminergic limbic structures.
This is explored in more detail in a neuroeconomic study of lesion patients by Naqvi 
et al. (2007). They argue that addiction reflects long-term adaptations. Many brain systems 
are implicated in addiction, such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Citing fMRI evidence, Naqvi et al.  observe that exposure to drug-associated cues activates the ante -
rior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula. They hypothesize that the insula is a critical neural substrate to addiction and therefore damage to the insula will disrupt addiction. Their focus on the insula is justified by the fact that it plays a key role in processing emotion and is associated with representation of bodily states/conscious urges/emotional feelings. Also, activity in the insula is shown to correlate with subjective cue-induced drug urges.
To test their hypotheses, Naqvi et al.  conduct a lesion patient study of 69 lesion pa -
tients, all smokers, 19 of whom had insula damage – six patients with right insula damage and 13 with left insula damage. The remaining 50 smokers had lesions but no insula damage. From patients’ responses to questionnaires about their habit they found that there were significant disruptions to smoking in four situations: first, if the subject had reported quitting less than a day after lesion onset; second, if they did not start smoking  201 nEU roECono MI C an alYSE S oF lEar nIng
again after they quit; third, if they had low ratings on difficulty of quitting; and fourth, if 
they reported no urges to smoke since quitting. They estimated the probability of smok -
ing disruption for insula damage patients and non-insula damage patients and estimated an odds ratio of 22.05 with a probability value of p=0.0005 so quitting smoking  was 22 
times more likely if a patient in their study had an insula lesion versus a lesion elsewhere.
Specifically for the extent of smoking disruption in quitters: 12 of 13 insula patients 
had smoking disruption; 4 of 19 patients with non-insula damage had smoking disrup -
tion giving an odds ratio of 136.46 [p=0.00008]. The insula damage patients were 136 times more likely to give up smoking. Some patients also had damage to adjacent areas and there were also significant effects if they had suffered damage to the dorsal striatum (putamen). There were no similar results for other behaviours such as eating, perhaps because smoking is a learned response and people have to learn to overcome the aversive effects. Overall, patients with insula damage were significantly more likely to quit smok -
ing easily and to remain abstinent. One patient observed that he quit because his “body forgot the urge to smoke”. Naqvi et al. conclude that the insula is a critical neural substrate 
in nicotine addiction.
Post-mortem studies
Hope et al. (2007) analysed post-mortem brain tissue from human smokers and former 
smokers and looked at enzyme levels in different areas of the brain; they found elevated levels in the nucleus accumbens (part of the ventral striatum) and ventral midbrain dopa -
minergic regions. Specific enzymes  are associated with activation of the reward system by 
stimulating dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens and with learning processes. They found higher enzyme levels in ventral midbrain dopaminergic regions for smokers and former smokers which suggests that repeated use of addictive drugs caused changes in the dopamine system and target neurons in the nucleus accumbens. This also suggests that smoking-induced brain neuro-adaptations can persist for long periods of time, which would explain frequent relapses in former smokers.
neuroeconomic analyses of learning
Neuroeconomic studies can illuminate the biases that underlie decision-making in uncer -
tain situations by identifying the neural correlates of analytical thought and assessing the extent to which these areas are engaged during ordinary decision-making and learning. For example, Yoshida and Ishii (2006) use fMRI techniques to analyse how people navi -
gate under uncertainty and how they adapt their existing beliefs using Bayesian reasoning. They find that areas of the prefrontal cortex are engaged during Bayesian updating and this evidence is consistent with standard models of Bayesian decision-making.
Neuroeconomics can help illuminate some of the connections between belief learn -
ing, reinforcement learning, social learning and other learning models explored in 
 C
hapter 5 . Tools such as fMRI can be used to establish links between learning and differ -
ential brain activation, exploiting parallels with research in economics, experimental psy -
chology and neuroscience. In addition to providing new research tools, neuroeconomics may offer new theoretical approaches that blend insights from different economic models and escape the binary classification of herding into rational versus non-rational.202 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
Belief learning and reinforcement learning
Neuroeconomic testing of belief learning models is more difficult because of the problem 
of empirically capturing the belief learning function. Nonetheless, Lohrenz et al.  (2007) 
have associated fictive learning with activations in the caudate nucleus, an area impli -
cated in neural processing of reward. In working-shirking games, Hampton et al.  (2008) 
identified neural correlates of sophisticated learning/strategic reasoning in the superior temporal sulcus, an area implicated in perception and emotion. Bhatt and Camerer (2005) found that poor strategic thinking in the second stages of beauty contest games was as -
sociated with differential activations in the insula, an area implicated in self-awareness as well as negative emotional processing, perhaps reflecting the fact that self-focus harms strategizing.
reward learning and reward prediction error
Reward learning (RL) models from economics are broadly associated with rewards and link to insights about reinforcement from psychology, including Thorndike’s laws of ef -
fect, recency and exercise – explained in Chapter 5 . Schultz et al. ’s (1997) study of reward 
prediction error is developed from the same psychological insights about reinforcement learning and captures the adaptive nature of learning (see also Schultz 2002, 2006, 2008 and Schultz et al.  2008) . Neuroeconomic insights about learning develop from an appli -
cation of neuroscientific models of reward learning and reward prediction error to eco -
nomic scenarios.
Reward prediction error is similar to adaptive expectations in macroeconomics: neu -
ral activations correlate not with a stimulus but with the difference between prediction and actual occurrence of an event. This enables reward learning when events are un -
expected . Learning  from “mistakes”, that is, the divergence between the predicted and 
actual outcome, triggers reward mechanisms. Single neuron experiments on monkeys have shown that dopaminergic neurons in the ventral striatum, a neural area associ -
ated with reward processing, also encode reward prediction error. There is also evidence of cue-conditioning. Initially, neurons fire when rewards are received but over time re -
sponses become cue-conditioned so that neurons fired with the cue not with the reward. The inference is that the dopamine neurons are not simply encoding the rewards but are also capturing predictions about the likely time and magnitude of the reward. Caplin and Dean (2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2009) have applied these insights from neuroscience in developing a neuroeconomic theory of learning based on rigorous analytical foundations.
observational learning
Insights from the neuroeconomic analysis of reward learning have also been applied to observational learning following models of reward prediction error in which prediction errors are used to increase the accuracy of predictions in the future via a process of learn -
ing (Schultz 2006). Burke et al . (2010a) conducted an imaging analysis of social learning 
to identify subjects’ neurological responses to observed actions and outcomes from others versus their individual actions and outcomes. Burke et al.  postulate that, in social learning, 
individual prediction errors are supplemented by observational prediction errors. This ap -
proach has elements of RL in its focus on individual action and outcome prediction errors  203 nEU roECono MI C an alYSE S oF lEar nIng
and also captures social learning from observing the actions and outcomes of others. This 
connects  analyses  of observational action and outcome prediction errors, linking into BL 
models and neuroscientific models of fictive, vicarious learning, as explored in Chapter 5 .
In this experiment, there is a two-stage learning process: observing others’ actions 
allows the player to imitate that action and observing others’ outcomes allows the player to refine the values associated with each stimulus. These hypotheses were analysed us -
ing fMRI and a simple “two-armed bandit” game incorporating  one “good” stimulus 
generating a reward and one “bad” stimulus giving no reward. If, for example, stimulus A is associated with an 80% probability of reward and stimulus B is associated with a 20% probability of reward then the subjects’ task is to learn to choose the best stimulus. Behavioural findings showed that more observable information about others’ outcomes as well as actions (versus actions alone) led to more correct choices and higher earnings. Imitation was observed in 66% of trials even when only others’ actions (not outcomes) were observed. Imitation was observed in 41% of trials when both outcomes and actions were observed because players were able to observe when others were getting it wrong.
The individual outcome prediction error was correlated with activity in the ventral 
striatum, associated with processing reward (as mentioned above), the dorsolateral pre -
frontal cortex (DLPFC) which is associated with cognition and attention, and the ventro -
medial prefrontal cortex, implicated in risky decision-making (VMPFC). This links with other studies identifying DLPFC activations with prediction error, conflict and uncertainty over which action to select. For the action prediction error, there was no response in the ventral striatum.
Observational action prediction error correlated with activity in the DLPFC. Obser -
vational outcome activations came from observing others’ outcomes and may reflect vi -
carious or fictive learning about rewards that have not been experienced but could have been experienced. Observational outcome prediction error correlated with positive ac -
tivations in the VMPFC. In other studies the VMPFC has been implicated in processing of reward expectations derived from diverse sources of information and the VMPFC may be one of the areas involved in the mirror system that allows us to understand others’ intentions. A particularly interesting finding was identified for observational outcome prediction error when negative activations in the ventral striatum were iden -
tified: when the subjects observed others’ actions delivering losses, the ventral striatum was activated. Whilst this finding may suggest that observing others’ losses drives a process of prediction error learning, it is also possible that watching another person lose is rewarding in itself. This would be consistent with other studies suggesting that the ventral striatum is implicated in social competition, punishment of others and in situations of advantageous inequality when a person sees someone else receiving less money. Behavioural models of inequity aversion can capture some of these phenomena, as explored in Chapters 2 and 6 .
More broadly, neuroscientific insights may illuminate some of the counterbalanc -
ing influences driving  herding behaviour , including social learning versus peer pres -
sure. Social pressure may emerge from imagined and empathetic responses as well as 
real and direct responses. Singer and Fehr (2005) and Singer et al.  (2004) analyse the 
motivations for responding to others and suggest that imagining experiences of others is associated with a similar neurocognitive response to direct experience 
 it
self. This 
suggests that unravelling some of the neurocognitive foundations of social behaviour 204 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
may illuminate how much of our copying and herding behaviours are driven by more 
impulsive and instinctive socio-psychological processes, versus more cognitive and de -
liberative learning mechanisms (Baddeley 2018).
neuroeconomic studies of social preferences
There has been a relatively large number of neuroeconomic studies of social decision-  
ma
king. This reflects the growth of social neuroscience, the increasingly successful collab -
orations between neuroscientists and social economists and also the fact that behavioural game theory can give a clean and tight experimental context in which relevant social factors can be controlled to study their neural correlates. For example, Sanfey (2007) observes that the study of social decision-making can be enhanced by using formal math -
ematical approaches from economics constrained by known neural mechanisms.
Cohen (2005) also argues that the evolution of the brain has been formed by social 
influences; with smaller groups, the chances of repeated interaction were greater. As so -
ciality evolved, strong emotional responses to selfish and exploitative behaviour increased fitness; worrying about reputation was a necessary adaptation to a world in which indi -
viduals had a high chance of repeated interaction with a small group of people. As we saw in Chapter 2, evidence for the operation of ancient emotional structures in the context of social influence includes evidence from ultimatum games, in which altruistic behaviours are associated with activations in areas associated with emotional processing , for example  
the insula (Sanfey et al.  2003). Evidence from neuroscientific analysis of economic games 
suggests that social rewards are associated with activations in areas associated with pro -
cessing of rewards, for example the ventral striatum, and these activations are in addition to activations from financial rewards. Also, activations are particularly pronounced when cooperation is reciprocated (Rilling et al.  2002, Sanfey 2007).
De quervain et al. ’ s analysis of altruistic punishment  
in the trust game
As explored above, players who violate social norms and defect in trust games inspire in their opponents a desire to punish altruistically. A classic neuroeconomic study of altruis -
tic punishment (AP), is de Quervain et al .’s (2004) brain imaging study. They focus on the 
social brain and associated moral emotions noting that human cooperation has evolved without modern law enforcement institutions, occurring even between unrelated indi -
viduals who will never meet again, and so therefore reflects mechanisms encouraging strong reciprocity.
De Quervain et al.  identify a role for altruistic punishment and reward. ‘Altruistic’ 
punishment (AP) occurs when people voluntarily incur costs when they punish defec -
tors for violating social norms and models incorporating AP give better predictions than models assuming self-interested preferences. AP can help to explain evolutionarily un -
precedented levels of cooperation in human societies but where does it come from? De Quervain et al. focus on evolutionary roots. They define biological altruism as costly acts 
for the individual in the present which confer economic benefits on others in the future. This enables the survival of the species. But why would someone be biologically altruistic if there’s no direct personal gain? The answer is that we have evolved to feel pleasure from  205 nEU roECono MI C StUDI ES oF SoCIal  PrEF ErEnCE S
AP and here de Quervain et al.  make a distinction between biological and psychological 
altruism: if we derive real psychological satisfaction from altruistic punishment (AP), 
then it is not psychological altruism but it does mimic the effects of biological altruism. In this way, de Quervain et al.  argue that AP has deep evolutionary roots and has evolved 
as a proximate mechanism. Proximate mechanisms are the present, immediate factors responsible for a given behaviour and reflect the evolution of internal physiology in re -
sponse to natural selection. AP bestows social benefits and so is a proximate mechanism that has been selected to ensure that people get hedonic/psychological rewards from AP. If punishment gives relief/satisfaction to the punisher then that is a beneficial action for the species in evolutionary terms.
In structuring their neuroeconomic study, de Quervain et al.  outline a series of hy -
potheses. Norms evolve to encourage cooperation, reciprocity and fairness even between unrelated individuals. In trust games, norms encourage A to trust B by sending money to B. B reciprocates, demonstrating trustworthiness when he/she sends money back. Social norms between genetically unrelated individuals are enforced through altruistic sanctions and these have a neural basis. Satisfaction from AP will be associated with activation of brain areas associated with goal-directed reward processing, including the striatum.
De Quervain et al.  incorporate punishment into an experimental design based around 
a trust game similar to Berg et al. ’s (1995) trust game (described in Chapter 2). Two hu -
man players, a trustor (A) and a trustee (B) interact anonymously in a trust game. They are rewarded with real monetary payoffs converted into monetary units (MUs). Each player starts with 10 MUs and if A gives 10 MUs to B, the experimenter quadruples the amount so that B receives 40 MU. Then B can either keep all 50 MUs, or can send 25 MUs back to A.
Extending the Berg et al.  experimental design, de Quervain et al.  also incorporate a 
third stage into the game in which if A perceives B to be an untrustworthy defector then A is given the opportunity to punish the violation of the reciprocity norm using up to 20 punishment points (PPs). Two types of punishment affected the punished defectors: symbolic punishment in which the PPs had no monetary equivalent and so did not reduce the defector’s payoffs. Effective punishment led to a real reduction in defectors’ payoffs of 2MUs per PP. For the punishers, there were two scenarios: costly punishment for which the punishers had to pay 1 MU per PP and free punishment in which the PPs incurred no monetary cost on the punisher.
There were four different treatment conditions used in a randomized sequence, cov -
ering scenarios in which B’s choice to defect was made freely determined by a random device; and punishment was/was not costly for A and B. These treatment conditions were:
a. Intentional, costly (IC): B is intentionally untrustworthy and A can use PPs to punish B with effective punishment. In this case, punishment is costly for both A and B. Twelve of 14 A subjects punished B subjects.
b. Intentional, free (IF): A does not have to pay to punish defectors. All 14 A subjects punished B if he/she kept all the money.
c. Intentional, symbolic (IS): for intentional defections by B, punishment was sym -
bolic and was free for both A and B.
d. Nonintentional, costly (NC): B’s decision determined randomly and punishment was costly. Only three of 14 A subjects punished B in the NC scenario.206 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
The experiment was run with 15 healthy, right-handed male subjects. Each player A 
played the game seven times with different player Bs and 14 out of 15 times A trusted B, so these findings broadly confirm Berg et al.’s finding that people generally exhibit trust. 
However, for all players A, B was trustworthy in three of seven trials and untrustworthy in the remaining four so there is less evidence of trustworthiness and reciprocity than there is of trust. Questionnaires were completed during the ten-minute interval between brain scans: player A indicated on a 7-point Likert scale (from -3 to +3) whether he per -
ceived B’s action in the previous trials to be fair or unfair.
De Quervain et al.  (2004) use PET scans to test their hypotheses. As explained above, 
positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans monitor blood flow following injections of substances (usually glucose) containing radioactive isotopes . These  emit gamma rays as they 
decay and the radiation is monitored by the PET scanner. Brain scanning was used only to analyse the trials in which player A trusted but player B did not reciprocate leading A to punish untrustworthy behaviour; de Quervain et al.  were interested specifically in subject A’s neural 
responses whilst deciding whether or not to punish B for being untrustworthy so scans were done of subject A for the one-minute deliberation period when he/she decides whether or not to punish B. In brain imaging studies, contrast conditions are used to allow quantitative comparisons of brain activation under different scenarios and if the differential activation in a particular area is large enough then it is inferred that that area of the brain is implicated.
The main hypotheses were that there would be differential activation in reward-
 
re
lated areas in the brain for five ‘contrast’ conditions:
1. IF–IS contrast between free versus symbolic punishment when B has defected inten -
tionally. Effective punishment is likely to be more satisfying than symbolic punish -
ment because it is perceived to be fairer and more just than symbolic punishment. Those with the strongest activation in reward-related areas for the IF–IS condition should also be those who incur the largest punishment costs.
2. IC–IS contrast between costly and symbolic punishment when B has defected in -
tentionally. If punishment is satisfying, then subjects should be willing to incur punishment costs leading to greater differential activation for the IC–IS contrast.
3. IF–NC contrast: NC condition shouldn’t stimulate any desire to punish because B’s behaviour is determined randomly by factors outside their control and so has not defected intentionally so in that sense is not at fault.
4. IC–NC contrast: again, B’s behaviour is unintentional and so would not be perceived as unfair.
5. Combined contrast [IC+IF]-[IS+NC]: this captures the coincidence of the desire and opportunity to punish captured by [IC+IF] versus no opportunity to punish in IS and no desire to punish in NC. [IS+NC] will not be satisfying and so will not activate reward-processing structures.
The PET imaging results revealed that the caudate nucleus played a prominent role with a lesser role for the thalamus and prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex.
Caudate activations
For all five contrast conditions there was increased blood flow to the caudate nucleus of the dorsal striatum (an area of the basal ganglia system associated with goal-directed  207 nEU roECono MI C StUDI ES oF SoCIal  PrEF ErEnCE S
reward processing). There were below average activations in IS and NC conditions in 
which there was neither opportunity nor desire to punish and a positive correlation be -
tween brain activation and actual punishment in the IC condition.
The caudate nucleus is known to play a prominent role in processing rewards and in 
particular reward expectation. One pathway for dopaminergic cells is through basal gan -
glia including the caudate nucleus. This is connected by dopamine pathways to the orbital cortex, and areas associated with higher-order planning of action. Caudate activations have been identified in lesion experiments with rats (Martin-Soelch et al.  2003), 
 si
ngle-neuron 
recordings in non-human primates (Apicella et al.  1991; Hikosaka et al.  1989), neuroimag -
ing studies (e.g. Koepp et al.  1998) and studies of cocaine consumption (Breiter et al.  1997) 
and nicotine (Stein et al.  1998).
To capture expected satisfaction from punishment, de Quervain et al.  compared cau -
date activations for the IF versus IC condition for 11 of the subjects who all punished at the same level. In the IF condition, because these 11 subjects punished at the same level (the maximum punishment) it follows that differences in caudate activations must reflect expected satisfaction from punishment; it cannot reflect differences in punishment be -
cause punishment levels were the same. If higher activation in the IF condition predicts larger investment in punishment in the IC condition, this is consistent with the hypothe -
sis that activations in the dorsal striatum reflect expected satisfaction. If so, these subjects will be willing to invest more in punishment. Results confirm this hypothesis: higher caudate activation in the IF condition correlates with higher activation in the IC condition too. Other neuroimaging studies with positive correlations between caudate activations and increases in monetary rewards suggest that the positive correlation between caudate activation and size of punishment in this study is explained by expectations of greater sat -
isfaction from punishment. This is consistent with the caudate’s role in integrating reward and behavioural information in goal-directed behaviour.
other neural activations
Other significant activations were found including higher activations in the thalamus in IC and IF conditions relative to the IS condition, but no significant differential thalamus activation when IC and IF are compared to NC, when the desire to punish should be absent. There were also significant differential activations in the prefrontal and orb -
itofrontal cortex. In the IC condition, punishers face a trade-off between the emotional satisfaction versus the monetary cost of AP. Reconciling this conflict requires integration of separate cognitive operations in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. Significant activations were found in Brodmann’s area 10, associated with integration of different cognitive operations in achieving higher behavioural goals and difficult choices requir -
ing reward value coding. The role of the orbitofrontal cortex indirectly supports the idea that punishment is satisfying. If it were not, no benefits and costs would have to be weighed against each other in the IC condition, and so the orbitofrontal cortex would not be activated.
Overall, de Quervain et al.  conclude that their findings are consistent with the ideas 
about proximate mechanisms: evolution has ensured that we respond in biologically al -
truistic ways even though we experience no objective benefits ourselves. These results also support tests of social preference models, e.g. from Rabin (1993), Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Camerer (2003a,b).208 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
neuroeconomic studies of social emotions
Neuroscientific evidence can help us to understand the roles played by socio-  ps ychological 
factors in economic decision-making and, developing ideas from psychology, evolution -
ary biology and neuroscience, neuroeconomists argue that understanding brain organ -
ization and function can help us to understand economic and financial behaviour. As 
explained above, Damasio (1994/2006) pioneered the neuroscientific analysis of the role of emotion in economic and financial decision-making, arguing that the impact of emo -
tional factors does not necessarily preclude rational thought. Mood and emotion do not necessarily work against reason, instead they may work in concert with it. Lesion patient studies established that brain lesions associated with damage to emotional processing led to constraints on rational behaviour.
One of the pioneering neuroeconomic studies of links between social preferences and 
social emotions was Sanfey et al.’s (2003) study of the neural basis of decision-making in 
the ultimatum game. Incorporating experimental design elements from Güth et al . (1982) 
and linking this into social utility models outlined in Chapter 2 – including models from Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000), Sanfey et al.  study the ultima -
tum game using fMRI imaging to investigate neural substrates of cognitive and emotional processes involved. As explained in the previous chapter, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) sig -
nal, as blood passes through an area of the body and the signal variation is detected by the fMRI scanner.
We introduced the ultimatum game in Chapter 2 and Sanfey et al. draw on the exper -
imental evidence from ultimatum games showing modal offers by “proposers” of around 50% of the total amount, with moderately low offers rejected by respondents in approxi-mately 50% of cases. But why would people knowingly reject monetary reward? It’s not a failure to understand or conceptualize because the ultimatum game is very simple. Sanfey et al. hypothesized that emotional responses to unfair treatment are fundamental adaptive 
mechanisms but they generate conflicts between motivations: cognitive processes push towards acceptance; emotional processes push towards rejection. So, the interaction of these processes when respondents reject unfair UG offers will be represented in brain ar -
eas associated with cognition, emotion and mediation of conflicting goals. Sanfey et al. are 
careful to use the intuitively accessible word “cognitive” rather than “rational” because they argue that emotional responses may have a rational basis too, mirroring some of An -
tonio Damasio’s insights about the somatic marker hypothesis, as explained above. A fear response is often rational in the face of physical threats, for example. They acknowledge that tighter, consistent use of terminology must develop as the field develops.
a neuroeconomic study of the Ultimatum game
Sanfey et al.’s experiment was designed so that 19 subjects met ten people before playing 
in the scanner. They were playing for a split of $10. Subjects were told that they would play a one-shot game and each subject completed 30 rounds with three “treatments” (of ten rounds each). In the first round they would play against the humans whom they’d met earlier. In the second round they would play against a computer. The third treatment was the control treatment; the subjects received money just for pressing buttons. This was to capture responses to monetary reinforcement independent of social interaction. For all  209 nEU roECono MI C StUDI ES oF SoCIal  E Mo tIonS
treatments (including those against humans), offers made were the same and were in fact 
determined by an algorithm designed to generate offers mimicking those typically made in an ordinary experimental context. For each round, the offer algorithm generated fair splits of $5:$5 for five offers and uneven splits for the remaining five offers in each round. The uneven splits were further divided into two offers of $9:$1, two offers of $8:$2 and one offer of $7:$3.
Sanfey et al.’s fMRI study is somewhat controversial (for experimental economists at 
least) because it uses a contrived offer algorithm involving limited deception. Subjects were told that they were responding to decisions from real people when they were re -
sponding to offers artificially generated by the experimenters. In experimental econom -
ics, incorporating deception is often regarded as taboo because of fears that it might lead to “dirty” experiments. Deception is more likely to be seen in psychological experiments and may be essential in neuroeconomic studies. Sanfey et al.  argue in defence of their 
experimental design that their deception was necessary given the “heavy logistic de -
mands” of fMRI studies and demonstrate that their limited deception has not affected the interpretation of results. As noted in Chapter 1, limited deception may be unavoidable in neuroimaging studies because of the technical, logistical and financial constraints.
Behavioural results
The behavioural results (ignoring the fMRI findings for the moment) showed unfair of -
fers from human proposers were rejected more frequently than unfair offers from com -
puters, perhaps reflecting a stronger response during human interaction. Participants’ reports from the debriefing stage revealed that standards of fairness were salient: when participants were asked what they thought would have been an unfair offer: 58% said that an offer less than 50% would be unfair; 42% said that an offer less than 30% would be unfair. Subjects reported feeling angry when they were made an unfair offer and they were prepared to sacrifice financial gain to punish their partner.
For the fMRI analysis, Sanfey et al.  specifically study three main areas of potential ac -
tivation and for these they find that unfair offers elicited activity in the bilateral anterior insula – a brain area often associated with emotional processing; the dorsolateral prefron -
tal cortex (DLPFC) – an area often associated with cognitive processing; goal maintenance and executive function; and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) – an area associated with conflict resolution.
Insula activations
The magnitude of activation in the insula was significantly greater for unfair offers from humans versus computers, perhaps because activations were not solely a function of amount of money offered but were also sensitive to the context (perception of unfair treatment). The responses in the bilateral anterior insula were also sensitive to a degree of unfairness in the offer. There was greater activation for unfair offers and the magnitude of activation scaled monotonically: activations for $9:$1 were stronger than for $8:$2 which were stronger than for $5:$5. Insula activation also correlated with subsequent decisions to reject; participants with stronger insula activations rejected a significantly higher proportion of unfair offers. The left anterior insula showed the strongest reaction to the most unfair offers. Overall findings from analysing insula response are consistent 210 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
with a general hypothesis that neural representations of emotional states guide behaviour. 
Activation of the anterior insula is associated with negative emotional states such as pain, distress, hunger, thirst, anger and disgust and Sanfey et al.  suggest that there may be links 
between the physical and social catalysts to emotional states. Unfair treatment including insultingly low offers in the ultimatum game generate “moral” disgust and anger , and 
engage the same neural structures in the anterior insula as are engaged when someone smells a bad smell.
DlPFC activations
In the DLPFC, there was activation to unfair offers but not to fair offers and DLPFC ac -
tivation was relatively constant across the unfair offers. There was no significant simple correlation with acceptance rates so DLPFC activation is not sufficient to explain accept -
ance of unfair offers but a differential comparison of brain areas leading to unfair offers subsequently rejected have relatively greater anterior insula activation relative to DLFPC activation. Unfair offers subsequently accepted have relatively greater DLFPC activation versus anterior insula activation. Overall, heightened DLPFC activation when playing the ultimatum game suggests that unfair offers are more difficult to accept and so impose higher cognitive demands to overcome the emotional tendency to reject.
Sanfey et al. emphasize that it is not possible to make meaningful quantitative  compar -
isons across different brain regions but they nonetheless analyse the patterns qualitatively . 
There are no significant simple correlations with acceptance rates for DLPFC activation. DLPFC activation alone cannot explain accepting unfair offers. However, a differential comparison of brain activations for unfair offers subsequently rejected  shows relatively high 
anterior insula activation relative to the DLFPC activations. Unfair offers subsequently accepted  have relatively greater DLFPC activations relative to the anterior insula activations. 
Overall, heightened DLPFC activation in response to unfair offers in the ultimatum game may suggest that unfair offers are more difficult to accept because they impose higher cognitive demands in overcoming the emotional tendency to reject.
anterior cingulate cortex activations
There were also significant activations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area associated with conflict resolution – as noted above. Sanfey et al.  suggest that this may 
reflect a conflict between the twin goals of resisting unfairness and accumulating money. The ACC may be implicated in resolving the conflict between the twin goals of resisting unfairness – associated with emotional responses and insula activation; and accumulating money – associated with cognitive processing and DLPFC activation.
Overall Sanfey et al. ’s findings suggest that emotional influences are an important, vi -
tal, dynamic component of decision-making. Sanfey et al.  conclude that the evidence from 
neuroeconomic studies provides a quantitative analysis that “may be useful in constrain -
ing the social utility function” but more research is needed on characterizing emotional responses, their neural substrates and the social context.
Linking to the neuroeconomic studies of social preferences explored above, sociality 
in decision-making is propelled by empathy and trust. Economic action is often about “mentalizing”, that is, guessing what others will do. Theory of the mind involves making inferences about the beliefs, feelings and action of others (Frith and Frith 2003; Camerer  211 nEU roECono MI C StUDI ES oF SoCIal  E Mo tIonS
et al. 2005). It is possible that herding emerges from such empathetic behaviour if people 
make decisions on the basis of mentalizing responses. Empathy and theory of mind are 
connected with emotional processing and so these aspects are also explored in Chapter 9 on moods, emotions and happiness.
Some experimental studies are surveyed in Singer and Fehr (2005) who argue that 
mentalizing and empathizing can explain how people respond to situations involving incomplete information. Singer et al. (2004) uncover evidence revealing that empathizing 
with the pain of others activates areas associated with the affective processing of pain. They also found heterogeneity in empathetic abilities across people. Avenanti et al.  2005 
use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques which, as explained in Chap -
ter 11, involve stimulating specific neural areas to find out how this affects behaviour. Us -
ing TMS, Avenanti et al.  identified motor responses associated with empathetic inferences 
about others’ pain. Previous research shows that children with autism or Asperger’s syn -
drome have trouble understanding emotions and social cues. This inability to empathize has been linked to relatively low levels of activation in the medial prefrontal regions and higher levels of activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Asperger patients, with higher activation in the ventral PFC suggesting perhaps that some sort of compensation is being made in patients who realize that their ability to empathize is constrained (Camerer et al. 2005; 2003a,b).
To investigate the hormonal dimensions of trust on social settings, a number of re -
searchers have studied the impact of oxytocin associated with social bonding. For exam -
ple, Zak et al . (2005) analysed a trust game with 212 individuals, males and females. Blood 
levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured and significant sex differences were found: men responded to distrust with increased levels of DHT, women didn’t. In other studies, higher oxytocin levels are found during online social networking; the 5% of peo -
ple who do not release oxytocin on stimulus are likely to be less trustworthy. Testosterone may also play a role in altruistic punishment  by inhibiting oxytocin release. Zak came 
to identify oxytocin as the “morality” hormone and the role of oxytocin was established either by measuring its levels or by administering it using nasal sprays.
Kosfeld et al. (2005) analysed the trust game and risk experiments with 194 healthy 
males who were given intranasal doses of oxytocin in spray form. The experimenters also measured demographic and psychological characteristics. They found that administering oxytocin significantly increased the average transfer levels in the trust game, inferring that oxytocin is involved in prosocial behaviour. Conlisk (2011), whilst sympathizing with the overall approach of these studies, does however identify a number of empirical shortcomings in the analyses and, similar to Binmore and Shaked’s (2010a,b) critique of Fehr and Schmidt’s analyses described above . Conlisk  concludes that Zak and colleagues 
are forming strong conclusions on the basis of limited evidence.
King-Casas et al.  (2005) conducted a hyperscanning experiment to capture the neural 
correlates of trust for repeated games. They found significant differential activations in the caudate nucleus which, as explained in Chapter 11, is implicated in the processing of 
reward expectation. King-Casas et al.  postulate that trust is just about expectations of fu -
ture reward and the concepts of reward expectations and trust are connected because the caudate nucleus modulates thinking about both.
Interactions between fairness and self-interest can also be captured using neuroeco -
nomic techniques. For example, Baumgartner et al.  (2011) explored social norms around  212 
Neuroeco Nomics ii: evide Nce
decisions relating to fairness using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninva -
sive brain stimulation technique – as explained in Chapter 11 . They used TMS to generate 
a “deviant” case and found that the deviant subjects were less likely to reject unfair of -
fers in an ultimatum game. They compared the deviant subjects’ neural activations with 
those from normal subjects. When there was a conflict between fairness and self-interest, normal subjects had significantly greater activations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC).
Neuroscience can provide a quantitative analysis that is useful in constraining so -
cial utility functions but more research is needed on characterizing emotional responses, their neural substrates and social context. However, as noted above, it is important to be cautious when interpreting imaging results, especially as there may be many systems and processes involved, not just the neural regions of interest  selected by the experimenters 
and for this reason it may be difficult precisely to attribute causality.
neuroeconomic studies of empathy  
a
nd theory of mind
Another aspect of social emotions is capacity for empathy, and this connects with models of theory of mind and mentalizing explored above , where we also introduced the neu -
roanatomical structures – mirror neurons. There have been a number of neuroeconomic studies of mirror neurons. Mirror neurons are located in the premotor areas of primate brains. They are activated without conscious control and generate imitative behaviour in primates. The discovery of human mirror neurons has lent some scientific support to biological explanations for imitative behaviour (Rizzolatti et al.  2002). If so, then the 
mirror system may be the neural basis for Smithian sympathy: observing others involves internally reproducing the mental processes of the observed person. 
 Si
ngle-cell record -
ings in monkeys have identified mirror neurons in the premotor cortex (PFC) which fire as monkeys perform grabbing movements themselves, and when they observe similar 
movements performed by experimenters (Rizzolatti et al.  2002). Baddeley et al.  (2005) 
suggest that such mirror neuron activity may explain imitation and herding in socio-eco -
nomic contexts. There is evidence that socialized instincts to imitate in humans are as -
sociated with mirror neuron activity (Iacobini 2005; Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004). The fact that similar responses are seen in our primate ancestors may indicate that herding behaviour is automatic and “hard-wired” and the outcome of primitive emotions such as impulsiveness.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimula -
tion (TMS) studies have tested hypotheses about theory of mind and empathy: empathy allows us to understand and share emotions and theory of mind allows us to understand others’ beliefs and desires. When experimental subjects observe their partner receiving painful electrical shocks, their empathetic responses engage automatic, emotional pro -
cessing circuits such as the insula. Furthermore, empathetic responses seem to be gen -
erated by making representations of our own internal feeling states in response to pain observed in others and heterogeneity in brain activation across subjects is strongly corre -
lated with heterogeneity in the responses to empathy questionnaires (Singer et al.  2004; 
Singer and Fehr 2005). 213 rEVISI on q UE StIo nS

Behavioural anomalies in finance
As we saw in Chapter 3, the literature on heuristics and bias is a dominant theme in 
behavioural economics, and much of the early work came from specific studies of anom -
alies in financial decision-making – and these formed the foundation of the new subject of behavioural finance. In fact, it could be argued that behavioural finance predated a substantial proportion of behavioural economics. A pioneer in behavioural finance was the behavioural economist Richard Thaler – who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2017. With a selection of his colleagues, he pioneered a series of studies of 
 “an
omalies”  – 
 vi
olations of traditional assumptions that economists used to make about how well and 
efficiently financial markets process information, as explained below. The Anomalies se -
ries was published in the American Economic Association’s journal Journal of Economic Perspec -
tives. In this chapter, we will introduce behavioural finance by focussing on some of these 
anomalies and related studies.
Behavioural finance provides an alternative to the microeconomic assumptions used 
by economists to capture financial decision-making based around key hpotheses:
a. The rational expectations hypothesis : in standard financial theory, rational agents are as -
sumed to use all currently available information efficiently and without making systematic mistakes. This means that their expectations of the future follow a ran -
dom path and fluctuations in asset prices are unpredictable because any useful in -
formation currently available is factored very quickly by rational agents into their expectations about the future.
b. The efficient markets hypothesis  that current asset prices fully reflect all currently available 
information and so asset prices follow a random walk, that is, they are not predict -
able because any predictable changes in asset prices would be arbitraged away.
An important point to clarify to prevent confusion is that, whilst behavioural economics and behavioural finance are often treated as separate albeit related disciplines, the distinction between them is largely artificial. This mirrors the parallels between more general theories in economics and finance. Both disciplines draw on the same basic economic assumptions. Similarly, many of the fundamental insights of behavioural economics such as prospect  215 HEUrIStICS In F Ina nCIal  D ECISI on -MakIng
theory, are applied widely in behavioural finance. Financial factors have profound impacts 
on economic decision-making, for example in planning for the future households will need access to financial institutions to enable borrowing or saving; financial instability has con -
sequences for the broader macroeconomy. Also, a lot of interesting new research covered in this book explores financial decisions as well as economic decisions. 
The origins of this separation of behavioural economics and behavioural finance re -
flect developments in mainstream neoclassical economics developing from Jean-Baptiste Say’s conception of money as a “veil” over real activity which includes assumptions such as the neutrality of money – that monetary and financial factors do not have long-term im -
pacts on the real side; and the Modigliani-Miller theorem of financing neutrality – given perfect capital markets, firms’ valuations are unaffected by financial structure because the financing costs associated with different financial instruments (loans, equity, bonds) are equalized. Given these assumptions, neoclassical economists is founded on the idea that finance is not a crucial variable in understanding investment and capital accumulation. 
More recently, especially with the arrival of a series of serious financial crises in the 
OECD, there is increasing recognition that real decisions are intertwined with financial decisions. One lesson the fallout from financial crises has taught us is that it is misleading to treat economics and finance as separate subjects; economic decisions affect financial decisions and vice versa – and it is important to understand how the two interact. There -
fore, as much as is feasible in one book, key developments in behavioural finance will be analysed in Part II, to complement the behavioural economics concepts we have already 
explored in Part I. For readers who are interested specifically in behavioural finance, key readings that focus on financial themes are outlined in the reading list in Chapter 1. 
Heuristics in financial decision-making
Whilst, as we have noted, it can be difficult to disentangle decisions that are “economic” from decisions that are “financial” – we will focus in this chapter on some of the heuris -
tics and biases that build on Thaler’s “anomalies” tradition – starting with some heuristics that have particular resonance when people are deciding about money and finance. As we saw in Chapter 3, Kahneman and Tversky identified a range of heuristics and related biases, and they divided the different types of heuristics into three broad categories of representativeness, availability and anchoring/adjustment. 
availability heuristic s
Gigerenzer and Goldstein’s (1996) insights about fast and frugal heuristics, introduced in Chapter 3, also have resonance for financial decision-making. When thinking about buying/selling shares from their portfolio, a potential investor may have little real knowl -
edge about what is going to happen to share prices in the future and given this limited information, they will adopt the heuristic of following the crowd. They will buy when the market is rising and others are buying and they will sell when the market is falling and others are selling. 
This links to the availability heuristic which is about the fact that we tend to make our 
decisions on the basis of information that is easy to retrieve and recall. There is therefore a crucial interplay between memory and decision-making in people’s use of heuristics.  216 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
The role of memory in decision-making has been studied extensively by cognitive psy -
chologists including Alan Baddeley (2002), and some of these insights have been applied 
specifically in the context of financial investment: Goetzman and Peles (1997) studied mutual funds investors’ perceptions of their performance. Using questionnaires, they explored the investors’ recollection of their performance and found a positive bias in investors’ recollections: the investors overestimated their own performance. The degree of bias also reflected previous choices, suggesting a degree of cognitive bias in investors’ assessments as well as their recollections.
representativeness, gambler’s fallacy and the illusion of control
Kahneman and Tversky also identify a number of biases reflecting “misconceptions of chance” and they link these to the representativeness heuristic because these biases emerge from making spurious comparisons between events. With misconceptions of chance, people judge that even very small segments of larger sequences are representa -
tive of the whole sequence, and this has an impact on gambling choices – a simple form of financial decision-making. Naïve gamblers expect the short sequence to represent the essential characteristics of a process and so will also expect to see those characteristics of the process locally – in each part of the sequence. For a series of coin tosses: they are asked to judge the relative likelihood of a series of coin tosses: for example, H-T-H-T-T-H versus H-H-H-T-T-T. In reality, small sequences that are locally representative, for example  
H-T-H-T-T-H, will contain too many alternatives and too few runs than would be ex -
pected from a random process. The representativeness heuristic also leads to a misconcep -
tion of chance known as gambler’s fallacy. The gambler’s fallacy is the belief that when a series of trials have all had the same outcome then the opposite outcome is more likely to occur next time, since random fluctuations seem more representative of the sample space. If there has been a long run of reds on a roulette wheel, then a gambler will often predict a black ball without reflecting that the roulette wheel has no memory and is not self-
 co
rrecting so will not know that it’s time to have a black ball win after a lot of red 
ball wins. Gamblers are ignoring the fact that each trial is independent of the next. As we explored in Chapter 3, this bias is seen even amongst scientists in what Tversky and Kahneman call the “law of small numbers”. Small samples are falsely assumed to be as representative of a population as large sample and so results from small samples will be overvalued and overinterpreted. The gambler’s fallacy also links to another form of bias: the illusion of control. This occurs when people act as though they can influence a sit -
uation over which they have no control. If lottery ticket holders have chosen their own numbers rather than using random number selection then they will value their lottery tickets more highly even though the probability of a win is identical in both cases. 
loss aversion, endowment effects and status quo bias
Thaler (1980) identified the endowment effect as a loss of utility from giving up a valued good greater than the gain in utility from acquiring the same good. This creates diver -
gences between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA). Knetsch (1989) conducted an experiment to capture endowment effects. Students were asked to choose between mugs and pens. Imagine a choice in which you won a mug and then were given the chance to trade it for five pens and you decided to keep the mug. Imagine  217 HEUrIStICS In F Ina nCIal  D ECISI on -MakIng
if this choice is reversed: you have five pens and are offered a mug; if your preferences are 
consistent and reversible then you will again choose the mug. 
Knetsch found students’ choices were not consistent and reversible. He divided a 
group of students into two groups which essentially captures different incarnations of their indifference curves: a WTA curve and a WTP curve. In standard theory, these curves should coincide. The WTP group started with $4.50; the WTA group started with five pens. The students were offered a series of trades: the WTP of the first group was assessed by giving the students opportunities to buy a pen at a range of prices; the WTA of the second group was captured by giving the students opportunities to sell their pens at a range of prices. Knetsch found that the preferences were determined by initial endow -
ments: those who started with more pens on average valued pens more highly than those who started with money. The WTP and WTA versions of the indifference curves were intersecting, violating the standard assumption of transitivity. This behaviour could not be attributed to subjective preferences for pens because those who started with pens did not rate pens more highly than the group who started with money. Valuations  will also 
be affected by disparities between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA). Knetsch observes that in valuing the loss of duck habitat WTP is only appropriate if the duck habitat is absent; stated WTP will undervalue environmental resources and WTA should be used instead (Knetsch 2010; Brown and Hagen 2010).
Divergences between WTP and WTA have been attributed by some behavioural econ -
omists to an endowment effect. People value things they own much more than things they do not own. This creates problems in markets because what a seller is prepared to accept may be much higher than what a buyer is willing to buy – a problem that has been explored in the context of housing markets. This can be explained as an endowment effect : 
people disproportionately value things they already own. Lakshminaryanan et al. (2008) 
find that capuchin monkeys are prone to endowment effects when trading treats given in the form of chunks of fruit. The monkeys required higher compensation to forgo a treat 
they already had than an equivalent treat that they did not have. Lakshminaryanan et al.  
postulate that this evidence may show that biases may be evolved behaviour. 
Endowment effects link to status quo bias. This is a phenomenon identified by Sam -
uelson and Zeckhauser (1988) capturing preferences for the current state of affairs. Sam -
uelson and Zeckhauser use an example of an economist who owns an expensive bottle of Bordeaux wine. He does not want to buy another bottle, nor does he want to sell the bottle he has. Kahneman et al . (1991) explore these effects in the context of car insurance 
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: two policy options are offered – a cheap option with restricted right to sue; and an expensive option with unrestricted right to sue. In New Jersey, the cheap policy was the default option. In Pennsylvania, the expensive policy was the default option. When offered the chance to buy the right to sue, only 23% of people in New Jersey took that option; they preferred to stay with the status quo. On the other hand, 53% of Pennsylvanians retain the right to sue and Kahneman et al.  also attribute this 
inconsistency to status quo bias.
Kahneman et al. (1990, 1991) and Kahneman and Tversky (1991) develop this analysis 
linking endowment effects to status quo bias and loss aversion. They did a range of ex -
periments to test the endowment effect. In one set of experiments they divided a group of 77 students randomly into three treatment conditions: Seller, Buyer or Chooser. The Sellers were given mugs and asked if they were prepared to sell those mugs at a range of 218 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
prices from $0.25 to $9.25. The Buyers were offered the mugs at the same set of prices. 
The Choosers were given a choice, at the same prices, between the money and the mugs , 
for example at p = $0.25 they could either have a mug or keep $0.25. The Sellers and Buyers are, in objective terms, in the same position yet there was a large divergence in reservation prices: the Sellers’ median price was $7.12 and the Choosers’ median price was $3.12. They attribute this inconsistency to the endowment effect. 
Aside from loss aversion and status quo bias, Kahneman et al . (1991) assert that loss 
aversion and related endowment effects can affect a wide range of decision-making in -
cluding job choice. They designed experiments in which people chose between two main aspects: commute time and social opportunities for contact with others. If people start a job that has many social opportunities then they will be reluctant to lose the job even if continuing the job involves significant extensions to their commuting times; if people start a job with shorter commute times then they are averse to losing this even at consid -
erable cost in terms of social life.
Kahneman et al. (1991) link status quo bias and endowment effects together as mani -
festations of the deeper tendency towards loss aversion, arguing that people are adjusting to changes  from a reference point given by the current status quo. The links between refer -
ence points and loss aversion, as we have explored in more detail in  Chapter 4 . 
Thaler (1980) identifies other manifestations of divergences between WTA and WTP 
including the fact that people are willing to pay for a vaccine to eliminate a small chance of death from a virus but less willing to accept money by participating in medical experiments when there is the same small chance of death. Viscusi et al.  (1987) describe an experiment 
in which consumers are shown cans of insecticide and asked about their  WTP to eliminate 
health risks, for example from poisoning. Then they are asked about their WTA if the in -
secticide was fine initially but they could have a price reduction if they were prepared to take an increased risk of poisoning. Divergences reflect more complex motivations  – legal 
distinctions between risk and failures of omissions versus commission, is an aspect that can be captured to an extent within regret theory, explored in Chapter 4. See also Plott and Zeiler (2005, 2007, 2011), and Isoni et al . (2011) on gaps between WTP and WTA.
Some studies attribute the endowment effect to experience, learning and context rather 
than to bounds on rationality and cognitive capacity. For example, List (2003) explores the impact of market experience on the endowment effect finding that behaviour converges to standard predictions as market experience increases. He concludes that market experience plays a significant role in eliminating the endowment effect and his findings are robust to institutional change. Endowment effects reflect people treating opportunity costs and monetary costs in different ways: “foregone gains are less painful than perceived losses”. This focus on actual losses rather than potential gains fits with legal principles: in tort law, a loss in expenditure is often given more legal weight that the failure to make a gain.
Neuroeconomic studies have used some of the techniques outlined in Chapter 11 and 
12 to capture how we seem to think around biases in willingness to pay versus willing -
ness to accept. Different neural responses are associated with divergences between will -
ingness to pay and willingness to accept. Knutson et al.  (2007) used fMRI techniques to 
analyse buyers’ decisions when they were exposed to a range of prices. They found that items purchased were associated with greater activations in the ventral striatum (associ -
ated with reward processing) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (associated with risk and decision-making). Anterior insula activations were lower for items purchased. This  219 MEntal a CCoUntIng a nD FraMIng
evidence suggests that reward processing and risk profiles are interacting when people 
experience conflicts between their willingness to pay and their willingness to accept.
Mental accounting and framing
Some of the financial anomalies outlined above can be understood within Thaler’s mental accounting framework – which captures decision-making specifically in the context of how we think about money and finance in different ways, depending on the context. This links to Kahneman and Tversky’s (1982) insights about framing , relevant in the context  of 
prospect theory. Kahneman and Tversky introduced the notion of “psychological ac -
counts” to capture the processes via which people frame and evaluate different outcomes. Thaler (1990, 1999) builds on this insight and also on other elements of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory including reference points, loss aversion and the non-linear value function, to propose a model of mental accounting which analyses how people economize on time and thinking by framing and bracketing their decisions and choices . 
Thaler (1999) connects mental accounting and framing arguing that people’s perceptions of different types of transactions will depend on the context in which they are made. 
Mental accounting
Thaler (1985, 1999) defines mental accounting as “the set of cognitive operations used by individuals and households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities”. The mental accounting approach captures the cognitive process via which people think about their transactions and sort them in their minds, depending on the type of expend -
iture involved. Thaler notes that individuals and households record and analyse their spending as businesses do, in order to track their money and keep spending under con -
trol. In the mental accounting model they do this not only using conventional methods such as computer and written records but also using psychophysical methods via which they sort expenditures into different mental accounts. 
Mental accounts provide a hedonic frame for “coding, categorizing and evaluating 
events” and this framing of choices means that decision-making is piecemeal and topical, affected by context. Mental sorting means that not all spending is perceived in the same way: “mental accounting matters” because the allocation of expenditures to different mental accounts has a significant impact on decisions and utility. Household spending vi -
olates the standard assumption of fungibility: expenditure in one mental account is not a perfect substitute for expenditure in another; and money cannot be costlessly reallocated between the mental accounts. The process of mental accounting is not neutral and will affect the utility gained from choices.
Thaler postulates three aspects to mental accounting, all designed to promote hedonic 
efficiency and maximize utility. The first aspect captures the process of evaluating deci -
sions and outcomes using both ex ante  and ex post  cost–benefit analyses. Expenditures are 
grouped into categories, sometimes constrained by explicit or implicit budgets. The second aspect involves the assignment of expenditures to different accounts and involves label -
ling and sorting spending into categories, and sometimes the different types of spending are constrained by implicit or explicit budgets. Stocks of cash, wealth and housing equity, are separated from flows of regular income and windfall gains. The third aspect relates to the frequency with which accounts are balanced and the bracketing of choices. 220 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
In terms of evaluating decisions and outcomes, people distinguish acquisition utility 
from transaction utility. Acquisition utility is similar to the concept of consumer surplus 
and captures the difference between the value of a good and its price. It is separated from transaction utility, which will be affected by perceptions of the value of a deal. In a sale for example, people will buy things not so much on the basis of their acquisition utility but because of transaction utility; they derive utility from snaffling a bargain. 
Thaler gives an example of a woman buying a quilt; she finds that quilts are on sale 
and all quilts (double, queen and king size) are on sale for the same price. The woman buys the biggest quilt even though it is too large for her bed. Some expenditures will be assigned to the mental equivalent of petty cash: framing a person’s choice, for example a charity donation, in terms of pennies per day rather than annual fees will mean that a cost will be less salient and therefore perceived as more manageable. Mental accounts are managed to maximize the utility of consumption and minimize the pain of expenditure. For example, a colleague of Thaler’s set up a charity account; he assigned a target donation to this regular account but then, when he experiences unforeseen losses, he draws from his charity account. In this way, unexpected costly expenditures seem less painful than if they came out of regular expenditure accounts. 
In sorting expenditures into mental accounts, choices may be bracketed broadly or nar -
rowly. Choice bracketing draws on insights from Read et al . (1999) who analyse the way that 
people combine choices either broadly, by assessing the consequences from groups or nar -
rowly, by assessing each choice on its own. In gambles, the attractiveness of two bets may be increased if they are bracketed together. Thaler gives the example of Paul Samuelson offering a colleague a bet by suggesting that they toss a coin and if the colleague wins the toss then they get $200; if they lose the toss they pay $100. The colleague offered to take the bet, but only if it was offered 100 times. This counter-offer does not make sense in terms of EUT but it can be explained in terms of mental accounting, bracketing and prospect the -
ory. If the bets are combined then the expected value of losses will be reduced and, given loss aversion, this will reduce the disutility of losses. Similarly, narrow framing, focusing on each potential loss in isolation will lead to myopic loss aversion and inhibit risk-taking. 
Choices will be updated and evaluated over different periods of time (daily, monthly, 
annually). The frequency of evaluation can explain share market anomalies such as the equity premium puzzle of persistent differences between the rate of return on equities versus bonds. Thaler argues that this reflects the fact that investors evaluate their stock purchases and update their reference points too frequently preventing them from adopt -
ing suitably long-term financial strategies. 
The mental accounting model is closely related to prospect theory and Thaler formu -
lates some “hedonic editing” hypotheses to capture how gains and losses are sorted. Given the concavity of the value function in the region of gains, he hypothesizes that it will be hedonically efficient to segregate gains to increase the sum of marginal value from sepa -
rate gains. Similarly, it would make people happier to integrate losses because, given the concavity of the value function in the region of losses, the sum of negative marginal values from losses will be less than if the losses are separated. Evidence shows that these hypothe -
ses are supported for gains, for example people prefer to win two lotteries paying $50 and $25 over winning one lottery paying $75. Separation of gains did seem to produce more happiness. However, people are also happier to separate losses and Thaler postulates that this is because loss aversion is even more pronounced than prospect theory allows: prior losses make people more sensitive to future losses and intensify the feeling of disutility. 221 MEntal a CCoUntIng a nD FraMIng
Mental accounts are opened and closed to minimize the pain of loss, and this explains 
the fact that investors are more likely to sell rising stocks than losing stocks. Sunk costs 
influence future decisions. Spending on an expensive pair of shoes will affect how many times the shoes are worn, how long they are stored unused and how long it takes before someone throws them away. Payments may be decoupled to reduce the perceived cost of a transaction and this explains credit card usage: paying for something using a credit card dis -
connects the buyer from the cost of the transaction by temporally separating purchase and payment and also because a credit card bill represents an amalgamation of many payments for different things, again reducing the salience of the cost of each particular  purchase. 
The violations of fungibility seen in mental accounting can reflect complex motiva -
tions. For example, people may underspend on particular categories for complex reasons such as to enable self-control. Consumers may pay premiums for smaller quantities of luxuries such as wine. People will accumulate money in funds that they mentally consider to be “off limits” thereby accumulating illiquid wealth whilst simultaneously running-up credit card debts in order to prevent consumption splurges, as explored in Chapter 7. 
Sources of income will affect how it is spent. Windfall income from a lottery win is often spent in a more frivolous way, on holidays for example, than income earned from work.
Understanding some apparent inconsistencies in choice can be enabled by recogniz -
ing that different expenditures are being assigned to different mental accounts depending on people’s perceptions of the context in which the transaction was made. Thaler (2000b) gives an example of Mr and Mrs L. and Mr and Mrs H. who went on a fishing trip, caught some fish and air-freighted them home but the fish were lost by the airline and so the airline gave them $300 compensation, which they spent on a dinner in a fancy restaurant at a cost which would be beyond their normal budget. In this case, the $300 was put into the “windfall account” and so could be spent in a way that the couples would not spend from normal expenditure account. Mental accounting approaches can also explain some apparent anomalies in inter-temporal decision-making , including in the context of pres -
ent bias and time inconsistency – as explored in Chapter 7.
Framing and bracketing 
We introduced framing and bracketing in Chapter 6 and these play a special role in Thal -
er’s mental accounting model, in which decisions about money and finance are evaluated relative to a person’s value function and its reference point – capturing the person’s percep -
tions of pleasure. The  process of mental accounting is affected by context but at the core is 
Kahneman and Tversky’s value function from prospect theory. As explained in Chapter 4 , 
this value function is assessed in terms of gains and losses relative to a reference point and assuming that people exhibit loss aversion. Then events are coded into a frame reflecting whether the transaction refers to the present or the future, whether it is a windfall gain, and so on. Thaler introduces the concept of hedonic framing in which people code joint outcomes to make themselves as happy as possible. They segregate gains and losses, as explained above. They separate acquisition utility from transaction utility. They may be reluctant to open and close these mental accounts depending on the context, for example traders are reluctant to close accounts that are in the red because of loss aversion. Opening and closing accounts also affects advance purchases; sunk costs and payment depreciation are treated separately. For example, people do not treat sunk costs in the way predicted by standard economics. Arkes and Blumer (1985) ran an experiment in which people could 222 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
buy theatre season tickets: one group paid full price, another group got a 13% discount and 
another got a 47% discount. Those who paid full price attended more plays in the first half of the season but all groups attended approximately the same number of plays in the sec -
ond half of the season. Thaler interprets this as people taking time to adjust to sunk costs.
Framing effects are a key source of cognitive bias and capture how people’s responses 
will be determined by the way/context in which questions or problems are framed. For example, people may exhibit disproportionate aversion to losses relative to their appre -
ciation of gains and so if warnings about the consequences of careless behaviour are framed in terms of the losses of irresponsible behaviour rather than the gains from being responsible, then they may be more effective. Also, there will be individual differences in personality traits and other characteristics leading some people to be overconfident about their knowledge and overoptimistic about future events. 
Kahneman and Tversky (1991) analyse endowment effects in the context of reference 
dependence: they argue that utility judgements are made with respect to changes from a reference point and perceptions of advantages and disadvantages. Kahneman and Tversky (1984) fit framing effects within a critique of standard assumptions but they find that choices from sets of gambles will depend on whether the gamble is framed as a gain or a loss, for example disease outbreaks. This violation of EUT rationality assumptions is seen in sophisticated as well as naïve subjects. 
❖ Case study: buying insuran Ce
In theory, insurance can be offered in two forms: probabilistic insurance (PI) and con -
tingent insurance (CI). An example of probabilistic insurance would be an insurance 
policy for which you pay a lower premium but the probability that the insurance com -
pany will cover your losses is reduced. For example, you pay half the regular premium and in return there is a 50% chance that the insurance will cover your loss, regardless of how that loss occurred. Your policy might cover you for any sort of loss but only on odd days of the month and not on even days of the month, for example . Kahneman 
and Tversky argue that people generally don’t want probabilistic insurance; they prefer contingent insurance. They want to be covered for losses contingent on a specific set of events. You insure your car in case of fire and theft and so if your car gets stolen, you are covered but this does not eliminate risk. There is still a chance that you’ll lose your car. For example, you might have an up-to-date fire and theft insurance policy but if your car rolls down the hill and crashes because you forgot to put the handbrake on, then that contingency is not covered. You bear the losses yourself. 
In expected utility theory ( EUT), which we explored in Chapter 4, people insure themselves 
against a wide range of risks involving both small and large losses and this reflects gen -
eral risk aversion and a concave utility function, but this cannot explain why people would 
prefer to insure themselves against a small set of specific contingencies. As explained in Chapter 4,  Kahneman and Tversky (1979) argue that EUT together with the assumption of 
risk aversion leads to the prediction that people should prefer probabilistic insurance (PI) to contingent insurance (CI). In terms of risk, CI is no more of a guarantee against loss than PI yet experimental evidence shows that real people seem to prefer CI.  223 MEntal a CCoUntIng a nD FraMIng
Kahneman and Tversky asked 95 students at Stanford University about their pref -
erences for CI versus PI. To test their hypotheses, they gave the students some in -
formation about a standard CI  policy which covered the policy-holder against losses 
from fire and theft. The students were also given information about the premiums 
and risks of particular events. The students were asked to start by imagining that they were at their indifference point, that is indifferent between taking out CI or no insurance at all. 
Then they were asked to consider an alternative PI  deal. They would pay a 50% pre -
mium upfront and if they suffered a loss then two possibilities followed:
A:
 A 50
% chance that the insurance company would request the remaining 50% of the 
premium and cover the loss, regardless of how that loss occurred.
B: A 50
% chance that the insurance company would refund the premium and not cover any 
of the loss.
The experimental results revealed that 80% of students rejected the PI offer, prefer -
ring to stick with a CI policy. Kahneman and Tversky argue that these choices cannot 
be explained using EUT. Kahneman and Tversky argue that the preference for CI over PI reflects a nonlinearity in preferences for risk and insurance captured within the prospect theory probability weighting function. Overweighting of probabilities of loss leads people to prefer CI over PI. 
The preference for contingent insurance of probabilistic insurance can illustrate a 
number of the biases and heuristics explored in Chapter 6. People may buy CI because they are suffering an illusion of control and believe that they have more control over some contingencies than others. It might also reflect a status quo bias because CI is the standard policy and people are more familiar with it. It may also link to availability and affect heuristics. People can imagine losing their car or house through theft or fire because the news is full of stories about fire and theft. Similarly, they can imagine being involved in accidents when they have been exposed to emotionally salient images of planes crashing and boats sinking. 
Overall, people can draw on examples of the contingencies offered in standard CI pol -
icies but are not affected by the thought that there might be causes of loss that they 
can’t imagine. 
On the other hand, they may suffer from choice overload. For example, the wide range 
of uncertainties surrounding health insurance including the chances of getting a wide range of different illnesses, and uncertainties about the monetary and non-monetary costs involved, means that it is difficult for people to form a clear judgement about whether they need health insurance and if so what sort of insurance is needed (Lieb -
man and Zeckhauser 2008). This sort of choice overload can lead people to decide that they want a simple, transparent policy that is easy to understand.224 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
trading puzzles
In the sections above, we have explored how some insights from behavioural economics 
can be used to explain anomalies in financial decision-making generally – the sort of fi -
nancial decisions that ordinary people make every day. These anomalies have much more impact once we take into account their role within financial systems, especially if they distort financial trading and speculation – that is, if they distort trading behaviour on financial markets for stocks, shares, commodities and currencies, and so on. Speculative bubbles and financial instability reflect an incomplete process of arbitrage : assets do not 
trade and markets do not clear at prices reflecting assets’ fundamental values. There are a number of observed market phenomena confirming that excess returns are not arbitraged away including seasonality effects, January effects, Monday effects, Labor Day effects, and so on. Specifically, in the context of equity markets, Barberis and Thaler (2005) describe a series of puzzles that characterize the historical performance of US stock markets: the equity premium puzzle – stocks have earned disproportionately high returns and yet in -
vestors are relatively unwilling to hold them; the volatility puzzle – stock returns are very variable with large dispersions; and the predictability puzzle – stock returns are predicta -
ble suggesting that persistent profits are not being eroded by arbitrage. 
These puzzles would not persist if financial markets were efficient because asset price 
changes would be inherently unpredictable. A rational arbitrageur would spot opportu -
nities for profit, would buy assets that were undervalued and, because financial markets move so quickly, any potential gains would quickly disappear leaving asset prices to fol -
low a random walk. 
Overall, limits to arbitrage can be explained in terms of misapplied heuristics and/
or prospect theory.
Anufriev and Hommes (2007) explore bounded rationality in financial trading exper -
iments and observe that traders use a small set of simple heuristics, including adaptive ex -
pectations, trend following and anchoring/adjustment. With learning, selection of simple forecasting heuristics evolves reflecting the forecasting performance of those heuristics and this generates path dependence. Developing these insights, Thoma (201 3) finds that 
increases in herding parameters generate speculative bubbles. 
Thaler and others analyse behavioural financial anomalies using insights from Tver -
sky and Kahneman’s (1974) analysis of heuristics and biases and Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory. There is a wide range of heuristics and biases specifically affecting financial markets and some of the more commonly identified financial biases are explored below. For a fuller analysis of heuristics and biases in financial markets, see Thaler (2005 , 
2016) for a comprehensive compilation of analyses.
overreactions and under-reactions
De Bondt and Thaler (1985) identify empirical evidence about overreactions in financial markets. They analysed monthly returns between 1926 and 1982 for portfolios of 35 New York Stock Exchange common stocks. They sort these portfolios on the basis of historical performance into winner and loser portfolios. Standard assumptions of rational agents and efficient markets generate a prediction that there should be no systematic tendency for either a winner or loser portfolio to outperform other portfolios because all relevant  225 traDIng P Uzz lES
information should already be captured by asset prices. Yet de Bondt and Thaler identified 
that loser portfolios outperformed the market by 19.6% on average and winner portfolios earned 5% less than the market on average. The overreaction observed was asymmetric and was larger for loser portfolios than for winner portfolios. Also, de Bondt and Thaler found turn-of-year effects and seasonality, consistent with other analyses and overreac -
tion was most common in the second and third years of the test period. They conclude that these anomalies reflect overshooting of fundamental values as a reaction to dramatic and unexpected news about particular stocks, with the overshooting followed by a grad -
ual reversion to mean.
overconfidence and overreactions
In Chapter 3, we introduced the problem of overconfidence in the context of representa -
tiveness heuristics. Overconfidence has particular traction in financial decision-making – for example, it is particularly problematic in the context of financial speculation. Camerer and Lovallo (1999) analyse overconfidence in the context of business planning mistakes, particularly excessive business entry. In experiments in which success depends on rela -
tive skills, most participants expect total profits to be negative but their own profits to be positive – without seeming to recognize that someone has to lose if total profits are negative. Overall, this inconsistency remains even when financial incentives are offered for correctly judging their own skill levels and skills are defined more clearly. Their hy -
pothesis is that the high rate of business failure reflects overconfidence and also reference group neglect: everyone knows that payoffs depend on skill and they know that everyone else knows that too. They should infer that others are self-selecting into the projects because they perceive their own skill levels are high and yet there is still excess entry. This phenomenon could also link into emotional reasons for participating, for example as captured by Keynes’s entrepreneurial animal spirits: the “spontaneous urge to action”, explored in more detail in Chapter 16.
Hong and Stein (1999) draw on attribution theory in attributing overreactions to over -
confidence and self-attribution biases. People tend to ascribe success to their own talents and ability, but will attribute adverse events to “noise and sabotage”. Paralleling these gen -
eral insights, Barberis and Thaler (2005) identify two aspects to overconfidence in financial markets: people underestimate the variance of asset returns leading to confidence intervals which are too narrow; and probabilities are poorly calibrated with people overestimating the probabilities of events that are very likely and underestimating the probability of events which are relatively improbable. Barberis and Thaler also note that overconfidence can reflect hindsight bias as well as self-attribution bias: after an event, people believe that they had predicted it beforehand (a common phenomenon in the fallout from recent financial crises). Barberis and Thaler also observe that confirmation biases may lead people to falsely assess contradictory evidence as confirmation of their prior hypotheses; in academic fi -
nance, people start with a belief in the efficient markets hypothesis and continue to believe it even in the face of contradictory evidence. Tuckett (2009, 2011) also addresses this type of effect in the context of a psychoanalytic approach to emotional finance.
Overreaction and overconfidence is observed not only in the decisions of financial 
traders but also amongst householders when householders overestimate their future abil -
ity to repay mortgages/payday loans/credit card bills even though they are struggling to 226 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
pay their bills today. When this pattern is repeated on a macroeconomic scale and inter -
acts with other financial market rigidities then it can precipitate financial instability, as 
was seen during the US subprime mortgage crisis. 
Under-reactions and the representativeness heuristic
Barberis et al. (1998) also analyse under-reactions  to good news and attribute them to conserva -
tism and/or misapplications of Tversky and Kahneman’s (1974) representativeness heuristic. With conservatism, people are slow to change their beliefs in response to new information and so whilst individuals may use Bayes’s rule to adjust their expectations, they adjust too slowly. Conservatism may lead people to disregard publicly available information, especially if it contradicts their private beliefs. As explained in Chapter 3 , the representativeness heu -
ristic can also lead people into gambler’s fallacy and/or neglecting sample sizes and base-rate probabilities, exacerbating biases in financial decision-making. Barberis et al.  (1998) identify 
the representativeness heuristic as a source of under-reaction occurring when people fo -
cus disproportionately on recently observed prices or prices paid by others because they perceive them to be more representative of expected future prices. As well as leading to under-reactions, representativeness may lead people into a gambler’s fallacy in which they expect a particular asset to “win” just because it’s been a loser in the past. Sample size neglect may encourage traders to focus on spurious patterns in very short series or small samples of financial data; for example, people may overrate the advice of a financial analyst who has picked a small, unrepresentative number of winning stocks (Barberis and Thaler 2005). 
Diversification biases and the availability heuristic
Financial instability may also be exacerbated by misapplications of Tversky and Kahne-man’s (1974) availability heuristic, also described in Chapter 3. People base decisions on recently available information and forget more distant, less salient events. During spec -
ulative episodes, they may only remember recent high prices, intensifying speculative euphoria. The availability heuristic and related familiarity biases can also lead to insuffi -
cient diversification and a common manifestation of this is home bias – the tendency for investors to hold a disproportionate number of domestically denominated assets in their portfolios. Various studies have identified home bias. French and Poterba (1991) found that Japanese, UK and US investors held 98%, 82% and 92% respectively of their equity investments in domestic equities. Barberis and Thaler (2005) attribute home bias to the role played by familiarity in the availability heuristic: information about domestic markets is more immediately available, familiar and salient.
Diversification biases can also emerge from choice bracketing. Thaler (1999) describes 
an experiment exploring children’s behaviour during Halloween trick-or-treating. Chil -
dren were offered opportunities to pick two treats either simultaneously at one house or sequentially at two different houses. More diversification was observed if the children were picking two treats simultaneously. Thaler concludes that when choices are bracketed together, people will opt for diversification. Benartzi and Thaler (2001) assert that a sim -
ilar approach of naïve diversification characterizes financial markets when people apply the “ 1/n heuristic”. When there are n investment opportunities, people will spread their 
budgets evenly with 1/n  of their funds allocated to each opportunity; the relative merits 
of the opportunities and/or investor’s initial preferences will often be ignored. 227 traDIng P Uzz lES
In financial decisions, when people are offered a range of investment vehicles then 
they will apply the 1/n heuristic by dividing their funds evenly across the investment 
vehicles even when one consistently outperforms the others. Bernatzi and Thaler (2001) analyse the 1/n heuristic using experimental techniques. They ask their experimental subjects to make choices in three different experimental treatments. In the first treatment, subjects chose between a stock fund and a bond fund; in a second treatment, they chose between a stock fund and a balanced fund, the latter comprising 50% stocks and 50% bonds; and in the third treatment, the subjects chose between a bond fund and a balanced fund. Bernatzi and Thaler observed naïve diversification across the two choices offered re -
gardless of what those two choices were and so the proportion of funds allocated to stocks varied depending on the pair of choices offered. With a simple choice between stocks and bonds, 54% was invested in stocks; with a choice between stocks versus a balance of stocks and bonds, 73% was invested in stocks; with a choice between bonds and a balance of stocks and bonds, 35% was invested in stocks. Standard financial theory predicts that people’s stock allocations will be determined purely by a person’s preference for stocks and whilst these preferences will be shaped by risk attitudes they should not be affected by the spurious pairing of choices.
Momentum trading
Bounds on rationality may lead traders to adopt simple heuristics in their trading de -
cisions and this can fuel momentum trading in which traders respond to market mo -
mentum rather than fundamental values, for example by buying into rising markets. Hong and Stein (1999) analyse momentum trading assuming two types of traders: news-watchers who make their decisions on the basis of private information and news, ignoring past prices; and momentum traders who engage in positive feedback trad -
ing and buy assets in response to increasing prices in those assets. With positive news stories, momentum may start to develop in the market, partly reflecting the impact of good news on the trading of news-watchers; however, given the presence of momentum traders, price rises will be magnified and will last long past the point at which prices attain fundamental values. Once doubt sets in amongst the momentum traders, the bub -
ble will burst and price reversals will precipitate destabilizing overreactions as traders rush to sell.
applications of Prospect the ory in behavioural finance
Some of the biases seen in financial markets can be explained in the context of Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory. Tversky and Kahneman (1974) analyse anchoring and adjustment around reference points. This insight is incorporated into Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory, as we explored in Chapter 4. Prospect theory postulates that perceptions of value are affected by changes relative to a reference point. Anchoring to subjectively determined reference points will mean that people’s expectations will be slow to adjust leading to sustained speculative episodes. Subjective perceptions will also be prone to framing effects: choices are determined by the context or frame within which decisions are taken, and this is consistent with Thaler’s (1985, 1999) analysis of framing within mental accounting models and Shefrin’s (2002) analysis of frame dependence in financial markets.228 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
loss aversion and the equity premium puzzle
In prospect theory, loss aversion occurs when judgements made relative to a reference 
point and losses are disproportionately painful relative to the pleasure from gains. Kah -
neman and Tversky’s prospect theory value function reflects the fact that losses are over -
weighted relative to gains and, in financial markets, this may lead investors and traders to hold onto assets even as asset prices are falling in order to avoid loss. When the current state of the world is used as a reference point, loss aversion will interact with anchoring generating status quo bias and familiarity bias favouring the current state of the world and/or things that are already familiar. Endowment effects will also distort people’s valua -
tions of objects, as explained earlier in this chapter. People will overvalue things that they already own leading to divergences between willingness to pay and willingness to accept: they will pay less for an object that they don’t yet own than they will accept when selling the same object that they already own. 
Loss aversion and endowment effects will have impacts on sale decisions within fi -
nancial markets and also in housing markets. Traders/speculators will not sell shares and homeowners do not sell their houses even when, financially, it would be wise to do so (Odean 1998; Genesove and Mayer 2001). Shefrin and Statman (1985) also identify a ten -
dency for people to sell winning stocks too easily whilst riding losers for too long, which may be a reflection of loss aversion. Benartzi and Thaler (1995) analyse short-termism together with loss aversion in an analysis of myopic loss aversion as an explanation for the equity premium puzzle, defined above as the persistence of relatively high returns on equities. Mehra and Prescott (1985) observe that, over the period 1889–1978, the average yield on the Standard and Poor 500 Index was 7%, six points higher than the yields on short-term debt which were less than 1% over the same period. 
Thaler et al. (1997) analyse myopic loss aversion arguing that it reflects a dispropor -
tionate sensitivity to losses relative to gains combined with frequent evaluations of out -
comes. They formulate two hypotheses. First, with myopic loss aversion, investors will accept risks more willingly if the frequency with which they can evaluate investments is limited and they may accept more risk if they evaluate their investments less often. Sec -
ond, if all payoffs are gains and losses are eliminated then investors will accept more risk.
Thaler et al. test these hypotheses experimentally using a task in which investors have 
the opportunity to learn from experience. They find that investors who can access feedback and information more frequently are more likely to avoid risk , but these risk-averse investors 
earned the lowest returns. Gneezy and Potters (1997) also argue that myopic loss aversion can explain the equity premium puzzle and the marketing strategies of fund managers. When in -
vestors evaluate returns more frequently they become more risk-averse. This is consistent with myopic loss aversion: people focus on short-term patterns when evaluating outcomes over time and are loss averse in the sense that they are more sensitive to stock market losses than to stock market gains  – this provides a behavioural explanation for the equity premium puzzle.
ambiguity aversion and the Ellsberg paradox
Ambiguity aversion and the Ellsberg paradox ( introduced in Chapter 4 ) can also be cap -
tured within prospect theory. In the probability weighting function of Kahneman and Tver -
sky’s prospect theory, ambiguity is discounted, certain probabilities are overweighted and low probabilities are underweighted. Barberis and Thaler (2005) observe that ambiguity  229 traDIng P Uzz lES
aversion will be a particular problem for financial markets because the probability distri -
bution of asset returns is unknown. Condie and Ganguli (2011) analyse ambiguity aversion 
in the context of Knightian uncertainty using simulation techniques. Ambiguous informa -
tion is often ignored within financial markets because traders exit or various forms of bias lead traders to ignore ambiguity in the data. 
Condie and Ganguli (2011) explore models incorporating ambiguity aversion when 
partial information is revealed. These insights can be applied to show that ambiguity aver -
sion in financial markets leads to phenomena not observed in standard models including increased trading volume and volatility, large price swings and “bad” signals not revealed to the market.
Overall, the range of biases and heuristics identified above will mean that financial 
markets do not automatically correct to fundamental values in the face of shocks. Various behavioural biases will lead to persistence and path dependency in asset prices. DeLong et al. (1991) show that noise traders can dominate markets and their errors are not neces -
sarily corrected. This means that they can have a strong impact because there will be no tendency for real-world traders to correct their errors. These biases may interact with so -
cio-economic factors such as herding as explored above, and also with psychological and emotional influences on financial markets, as we will explore in the following chapters.
time inconsistency and financial decision-making
Time inconsistency is particularly problematic in the context of financial decision-  ma king 
and pension planning because time plays a crucial role in these decisions and, as ex -
plored in Chapter 7, people who realise they are susceptible to self-control problems will implement pre-commitment strategies to limit their impulsive behaviours. For savings, Ashraf et al. (2006) discuss the role of pre-commitment strategies in banking: they exam -
ined savings decisions in an experimental treatment allowing people an option to open a savings account at the same time that they started a bank account. They were paid the same interest rate on the money in their savings account but their money was locked in. People who opted for this increased savings rates by 82%. This evidence suggests that pre-
 
co
mmitment devices may be an essential part of enabling people to save. 
The issue of present bias over long time horizons is particularly pressing in the con -
text of pension provision. To properly prepare for retirement, people may have to make decisions which will not affect their standard of living for 40 years (or more as retirement ages increase). Increasing pressures on government finances alongside increases in life expectancy mean that most governments will struggle to help their ageing populations and individual responsibility will become a stronger theme in pension provision. Whilst governments may not be able to provide retirement incomes to people, Thaler and Sun -
stein (2008) argue that governments could nonetheless adopt an approach of “liberal paternalism”: allowing people the freedom to choose whilst also nudging them in a con-structive direction. With greater attention to the “architecture” of choice, people may be able to plan more effectively over their lifetimes. In planning for retirement, present bias and time inconsistency may interact with others forms of bias, including status quo and familiarity biases. 
The current standard default for many people is that they make no contributions au -
tomatically; they have to opt in to make pension contributions. Madrian and Shea (2001) 230 BEHaVIoUral  ano MalIE S In F Inan CE
analyse the impact of adjusting these pension defaults. The architecture of choice could 
be adjusted to set default options so that individuals do contribute automatically and if they’d prefer not to contribute then they have to opt out. Madrian and Shea found that pension participation increased by 65–98% with opt-outs rather than opt-ins. Similarly, Thaler and Benartzi (2004) show that their Save More for Tomorrow scheme – in which people allocate a set proportion of their salary rises towards their pension – can also be very effective in encouraging people to save for retirement.
Chapter summary
 •Key insights from behavioural finance form the foundation for the analysis of heu -
ristics and bias in behavioural economics, developing from pioneering analyses by Richard Thaler of behavioural anomalies in financial decision-making.
 •Some financial anomalies can be explained by divergences between willingness to pay and willingness to accept – linking to endowment effects.
 •Thaler’s mental accounting model captures how seemingly irrational financial de -
cisions can be explained by relaxing the assumption of fungibility. Instead, people think about different financial decisions in different ways depending on the context – framing and bracketing different financial decisions into different mental “accounts”, including windfall accounts, income accounts and asset accounts.
 •Specific anomalies affect financial speculation in asset markets including myopic loss aversion, endowment effects, and so on.
 •Some financial anomalies are an amalgamation of different biases – for example, my -
opic loss aversion , a potential explanation for the equity premium puzzle, reflects  an 
interplay of time inconsistency and loss aversion. 
review questions 
1. Define Thaler’s concept of a financial anomaly and illustrate with some examples. 
2. What is mental accounting? Set out the model including the different types of mental accounts and how people use them differently in their everyday financial decision-making.
3. How do behavioural economists explain the fact that people will simultaneously save money and incur debt, and not use their savings to pay off debt even though they would save money by doing so. Are there any non-behavioural explanations for this behaviour?
4. What is myopic loss aversion and how does it affect financial decision-making?In the previous chapter, we explored how individuals’ decisions about money and finance 
are affected by behavioural influences. In this chapter, we shift our focus to the firm to explore the question: How are firms’ financial decisions affected by behavioural influ -
ences? Firms are affected by complexities that consumers do not have to worry about, so firms’ finances are more complex than householders’ choices, and behavioural influences magnify this complexity.
A key issue for businesses is financing their investment decisions so to fund fixed asset 
investments that generate profits for the future. In exploring how all these decisions come together, we will start with a long-established literature on the behavioural theory of the firm to capture some of the basics of how behavioural economics is applied in analysing firms’ decision-making, and then we will turn to the issue of financing investment by introducing novel approaches to investment appraisal, drawing on insights from behav -
ioural economics – specifically by incorporating behavioural assumptions about discount rates into investment appraisal tools.
neoclassical theory of the firm
To capture how behavioural economics brings in new, different perspective, we can start by outlining the key elements of conventional, neoclassical theory of the firm. Neo -
classical theory of the firm is built around principles of constrained optimization, in which businesses make their decisions given a specific form of production function – 
 co
nventionally a Cobb-Douglas production function (CDPF). In their production, firms 
are assumed to minimize cost functions subject to the production technology they are using, as captured in the specification of the CDPF where simple cost functions include the total cost of all labour inputs and all capital inputs. There are many conceptual prob -
lems with this constrained optimization approach – some of the most profound raise issues around what is capital and how do we measure it. These fundamental conceptual limitations are not essential to explore here. Instead, we will focus on elements of neo -
classical theory that are important to understanding behavioural theories of the business investment and  finance.Chapter 14
Corporate investment and finance232 Cor Porat E InVE StMEnt  an D F Ina nCE
A central issue is how businesses deal with uncertainty because, as we have seen in 
previous chapters, behavioural biases, and so on, have more traction when the paths for 
“correct” decision-making are not so clear. In building up productive capacity for the future, firms undertake fixed asset investment. In standard neoclassical versions of in -
vestment theory, the representative firm invests until the marginal productivity of capital is balanced by the user cost of capital which captures the relative cost of capital inputs (Jorgenson 1963). In the neoclassical world, the firm is a black box: inputs go in, outputs come out and what happens in between is not of interest. Firms are assumed to have easy access to finance and will borrow at rates that match their profit expectations. Standard models focus on the combinations and relative factor costs of capital and labour. Invest -
ment will also be determined by expectations of the future and in standard models, investment is the product of complex, forward-looking investment appraisal strategies. Whilst standard approaches allow subjectivity in entrepreneurs’ expectations it is assumed that these subjective judgments coincide, on average, with some objective probability distribution ensuring that mistakes are not systematic.
Another problem with standard neoclassical theories of production and investment is 
that they do not address very well the issue of how firms form expectations of the future. Tobin and Brainard’s (1977) q models of investment provide a solution by postulating that entrepreneurs form rational expectations of their future profits on the basis of stock mar -
ket valuations. This requires an additional assumption that financial markets are efficient with asset prices responding instantaneously to news and reflecting all currently available, relevant information about the profitability of firms.
A further problem, plaguing Tobin’s q models as well as the early neoclassical models 
is that they do not allow for uncertainty. The real options theories of Dixit and Pinyck (1994), for example, address this limitation by allowing that uncertainty and irreversi -
bility interact to constrain investment. Only when uncertainty and irreversibility occur together is there a problem for a rational entrepreneur running a business: if there is com -
plete reversibility but uncertainty, then there is no problem because the business person can costlessly change their mind. At the opposite extreme, if there is no uncertainty then a rational business person will get their decisions right the first time and so would never want to change their minds.
All this assumes that firms are run by perfectly rational agents who do not make sys -
tematic mistakes. Behavioural theories explore what happens when the people running businesses are not super-rational in the ways assumed in neoclassical economics.
alternative behavioural assumptions
The entrepreneurs in standard neoclassical theories of production and investment are characterized by ‘substantively rationality’, defined by Simon (1979) as the achievement of objective goals given objective constraints (Simon 1979). Standard approaches also imply organizational rationality: if a firm is monolithic then it can be treated as an individual and so the organizational rationality of the firm coincides with the individual rationality of a monolithic entrepreneur (Simon 1972). In this way, the firm in standard economic analyses is treated as a single simple entity.
The standard neoclassical theories focus on the use of complex mathematical tech -
niques and algorithmic styles of decision-making as opposed to the heuristical styles of  233 nEoClaSSIC al t HEorY oF tHE F IrM
decision-making seen in behavioural economics. Algorithmic approaches assume that in -
vestors, using the same information set, will form identical expectations centred around 
some objective probability distribution of outcomes. They will be forward-looking in incorporating discount rates into their investment appraisal techniques. If these meth -
ods are used correctly, then the firm will be optimizing some objective function, given constraints and investment will take place to the point at which the manager maximizes his/her profits by undertaking all investments with a net present value greater than or equal to 0. The discount rate used to derive the net present value will be equal to the real cost of borrowing, adjusted for risk. Algorithmic approaches are outlined in detail in conventional analyses of fixed asset investment activity, for example in Jorgenson’s (1963) neoclassical model, in Abel (1983) and others’ q theories; and in Dixit and Pindyck (1994) and Pindyck’s (1991) real options theories of uncertainty and irreversibility in investment. Despite some differences in analysis, these approaches can be understood as refinements of Jorgenson’s basic model with each refinement incorporating more thorough and com -
plex approaches to the analysis of expectations and uncertainty into a basic model of substantively rational profit-maximizing firms (see Baddeley 2003 for a survey).
real options investment appraisal
If investors are concerned about uncertainty then they will be more reluctant to invest – and so there will be a negative relationship between investment and uncertainty. The un -
certainty constraint is particularly pressing for industries experiencing rapid technological change, and when lags between planning and delivery are long and complex. Innovative energy businesses are an example – energy technologies are changing all the time and how can energy businesses build a business case to enable them to access finance?
Dixit and Pindyck draw an analogy with financial options: exercising an option to 
invest involves an opportunity cost. In the case of real options , this is the value of new 
information forgone when the option is exercised sooner rather than later. In an uncertain world, and when decisions are irreversible because of large sunk costs, the opportunity cost of investment is large, giving investors a rational reason to delay their decisions. When uncertainty and irreversibility are so intertwined, timing is crucial and the in -
frastructure investor’s question transforms from “Should I invest? Yes or no?” to “When should I invest? Sooner or later?” It may be in the best interest of the investor to post -
pone their investment whilst they collect more information. Dixit and Pindyck note that these investment opportunity costs can be large and so standard NPV investment appraisal tools, although almost universally applied by larger investors, may lead to large errors in decision-making.
Uncertainty problems are most pronounced for investments characterized by high 
degrees of irreversibility – when sunk costs are large. For reversible investments, with low sunk costs, uncertainty is less of a problem because an investor can change their mind and retrieve most of their costs – for example, a small business investing in a utility vehicle can relatively easily and costlessly reverse their decision by selling their vehicle. On the other hand, when there is no uncertainty, irreversibility is not a problem because the rational investor knows what to do from the start. If an investor is dedicating millions to a large-scale project but knows what will happen in the future (impossible in reality of course) then they will make the best decision from the outset; they will not want to 234 Cor Porat E InVE StMEnt  an D F Ina nCE
change their mind. So, the essence of the problem comes when uncertainty and irre -
versibility interact. With uncertainty, the best investment strategy is not obvious; with 
irreversibility, the opportunity costs of poor decisions are large.
Public infrastructure projects are exemplars of this interacting problem. Large-scale 
energy and transport infrastructure projects escape neither uncertainty nor irreversibility. They are characterized by very high sunk costs. When rapid technological change and technological risk are added to the mix, the problems created by interactions of uncer -
tainty and irreversibility are magnified. Innovative energy and transport infrastructures are often fixed in place, specialist and unlikely to find an alternative user. Even if there were alternative uses, standard asymmetric information problems around adverse selec -
tion and the “lemons principle” create difficulties for fixed asset investors. In order to sell their second-hand capital equipment, they face a challenge in convincing potential buyers that the capital equipment they are trying to sell is in good working order.
Together, uncertainty and irreversibility are a particularly significant barrier for large-
scale investment. Yet, in the real world, problems of uncertainty and irreversibility are not often addressed in investment appraisal. The standard investment appraisal techniques used in practice – even for large-scale infrastructure projects – are based around discounted cash flows – specifically net present value (NPV) investment rules. NPV is used ubiquitously in public infrastructure project appraisal, but it suffers serious limitations. One question is how to accurately identify an appropriate discount rate to use in an NPV calculation. But even if an appropriate and accurate discount rate can be identified, NPV rules do not explicitly allow for uncertainty, including uncertainties created by new innovations and technological risk (Baddeley 2003). NPV rules implicitly assume that investments are a “now or never proposition”: if the decision-maker does not invest in the project now, they will never do so (Dixit and Pindyck 1994, p. 6). NPV captures neither the potential bene -
fits of staging or postponing irreversible investment projects with large sunk costs nor the value of information forgone when decisions are made sooner rather than later.
The basic economic theory links to the literature of fixed asset investment appraisal. 
Firms can use a range of techniques, from simple rates of return, payback period rules, net present value and related techniques through to real options theory (Harcourt 1968; Baddeley 2003, 2006a). Simpler techniques are most widely used by small businesses. For large government and government-sponsored infrastructure projects, discounted cash-flow methods are preferred: projects with the highest benefit-to-cost ratio, as measured in terms of NPV, are prioritized for funding (Ehlers 2014). NPV appraisal techniques can capture some of the complexities of infrastructure investments in terms of externalities and social/environment impacts, but these methods do not capture the interacting prob -
lems of uncertainty and irreversibility as identified above. Real options ( RO) techniques 
fill this gap by extending the discounted cash-flow methods associated with NPV into a world in which investment decisions are not simple “one-off” decisions, where timing is important and where interactions between uncertainty and irreversibility act as a substan -
tial brake on innovative investment.
Economic theory has identified a number of problems with investment appraisal 
techniques that assume both that the future is somehow knowable and that the timing of fixed asset investment projects is not perturbed by fluctuations in uncertainty and imper -
fect information. Essentially, the problem with NPV techniques is that they do not allow for uncertainty and irreversibility, and this gap is a significant oversight especially for  big  235 nEoClaSSIC al t HEorY oF tHE F IrM
public  infrastructure investments for which timing is often a crucial dimension – for 
example, the ability to delay an energy or transport investment is especially important 
when the impacts of irreversible investment are difficult to predict in an uncertain 
world.
Behavioural theories of the firm
In the real world, entrepreneurs’ decisions will be affected by a multiplicity of factors and a crucial role is played by subjective factors such as business confidence and animal spirits. Keynes argues that profound uncertainty and fragile business confidence compromise the expectations-formation process, exacerbating volatility and pessimism in investor behav -
iour. Behavioural microeconomic analyses of real-world firms draw on themes from behav -
ioural economics. Austrian analyses of entrepreneurship and investment draw on similar concepts to animal spirits, for example Kirzner’s (1973) analyses of entrepreneurship as the product of alertness directed by interest. Behavioural concepts such as attention bias are introduced into some theories of the firm. Entrepreneurial and empire-building activities may involve attempts to manage the attention of others, as with the setting of agendas at meetings and via the design of advertisements and shopping malls (Earl and Potts 2000, 2016; Earl 2005). Similarly, Hart and Moore’s (1990, 2008) theory links with Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory, for example reference points are constructed around predetermined competitive contracts. Similarly, Fehr et al. (2011) incorporate prospect the -
ory into a model of firm behaviour by focussing on long-term contracts; using a market experiment which separates responses to rigid versus flexible contracts and good versus bad states they find empirical support for Hart and Moore’s (1990, 2008) theory of the firm.
Evaluation  biases will also distort firms’ decision-making – for example, when people 
are judging the likely success of investment strategies. Some investment strategies involve a step-by-step process of success or failure – an example would be new product develop -
ment in the pharmaceutical industry in which there is a chain-like series of events: a trial is successful, the drug is successfully patented, then it is effectively marketed, and so on. This series of events is conjunctive and Kahneman and Tversky predict that investors will be overoptimistic because they overestimate the likelihood of this series of related events. However, if it is a disjunctive event then there will be numbers of unrelated risks which do not develop sequentially over time. The new technology of “fracking” or rock-blasting to extract shale gas is an example. There are a series of risks involved in fracking. Fracking might cause an earthquake. It might contaminate groundwater. There may be industrial accidents. These events are not sequential and chain-like and together they form a disjunctive event. So, applying Tversky and Kahneman’s analysis, the overall risk may be underestimated.
Entrepreneurs’ heuristics
For businesses’ investment strategies, heuristics can outperform complex algorithmic methods of decision-making, an insight also confirmed in the analysis of investment decision-making: simple rules of thumb in investment project management approximate more complex algorithmic tools incorporating discounting methods and so, given the ease of the simpler methods, they are preferable in terms of economizing on information search and decision-making effort (Baddeley 2006a). Specifically, some heuristics cre -
ate problems for businesses. Evaluation biases emerging from anchoring and adjustment 236 Cor Porat E InVE StMEnt  an D F Ina nCE
heuristics were introduced as one of the biases explored in Chapter 3. Evaluation biases 
occur when people do not fully adjust their estimates of the chances of success for one strategy over another because they are distracted by prior information.
For investment theories, problems emerge in unifying the approaches to capture the es -
sence of investment behaviour. One of the differences is in the styles of decision-
 mak
ing. A 
key distinguishing characteristic of behavioural approaches relative to standard approaches is that behavioural approaches are more consistent with Simon’s (1979) definition of pro -
cedural rationality : decision-making as the outcome of 
 pr
oblem-solving, intuition and “ap -
propriate deliberation” than with substantive rationality which is associated with perfectly informed, utility/profit maximising decision-making . For entrepreneurs and investment, 
this implies that entrepreneurs will use heuristical methods rather than algorithmic meth -
ods in making their investment decisions (Baddeley 2006a).
Simon (1972) focuses on bounded rationality affected by constraints and limits to 
rationality. He also emphasized the importance of other goals; entrepreneurs are not nec -
essarily aiming to maximise. When complexity and uncertainty make global rationality impossible, firms will satisfice and settle for what’s satisfactory rather than what’s best (Simon 1972). Behavioural biases emerge at one or more of the three key stages of the investment decision-making process: gathering information; predicting future events (e.g. likely sales); and investment project appraisal. At each of these stages, businesses may make mistakes: information may be missing or misinterpreted; information may be pro -
cessed inefficiently to give misleading predictions. If inappropriate appraisal techniques are used, then even accurate predictions may be misused (Simon 1979).
Procedurally rational entrepreneurs will use heuristics and simple rules of thumb based 
on experience to guide their investment decisions. They will use simple heuristics (or com -
mon-sense rule of thumb based on experience) in deciding whether or not to invest in par -
ticular projects. In judging the value of investments, a procedurally rational entrepreneur will calculate how long it takes to pay off an investment project, that is, they use payback period (PBP) calculations. If they judge the value of a project in terms of its likely (undis -
counted) cash flow relative to its cost, then they will use the accounting rates of return (ARR) as an investment appraisal tool. PBPs and ARRs are based around simple assumptions about likely future events and do not require discounting methods (Baddeley 2006a).
Entrepreneurs will also use gut feel and common sense rather than complex mathe -
matical techniques in assessing investment plans. Different investors, faced with the same information, may form different expectations reflecting arbitrarily assigned margins of error. These errors will not cancel out because entrepreneurs’ judgements may be affected by herding and social learning (discussed in Chapter 6 ). In a world of incomplete infor -
mation, it will be procedurally rational to follow the crowd, as explained in Topol (1991), and/or to learn from past output signals about what other investors are doing (Acemoglu 1993). Herding and mimetic contagion will lead to non-random errors in expectations generating systematic trends and path dependency in aggregate investment.
The use of algorithmic techniques is problematic because net present value calcula -
tions require judgements about discount rates. Making these judgements about the value of expenditure today over income tomorrow are likely to be difficult in a world con -
strained by endemic and immeasurable uncertainty about the future. Given these prob -
lems with algorithmic techniques, identifying simple and reliable proxies for IRRs and/or NPV is important. A procedurally rational investor may decide not to incur the costs  237 nEoClaSSIC al t HEorY oF tHE F IrM
involved in identifying a discount rate either because they are ignorant that the value of 
money changes over time or because they judge that current information is fallible and that the future is too uncertain for calculations based around discounting procedures to be of much use. The use of simple heuristics can be effective in an investment setting and Baddeley (2006a) shows that, given some simplifying assumptions, applying heu -
ristics such as the ARR and PBP give approximately the same result as from algorithmic 
calculations including net present value and the internal rate of return. Judgements about complex and uncertain things such as discount rates may be unnecessary in some settings.
risk and uncertainty in firm decision-making
Entrepreneurs’ investment decisions will also be profoundly affected by immeasurable, Knightian uncertainty. This will prevent the application of clear and objective mathematical rules to guide their expectations of profit. Uncertainty creates a number of specific prob -
lems. First, information is incomplete and the data-generating processes dictating economic outcomes are often unknown; an investment decision is not like dealing a card from a pack of 52 cards or buying a lottery ticket when you know that one million tickets are being sold. Second, investment decisions are often about non-repeatable and unprecedented events and this means that information about past outcomes (e.g. as might be captured by frequency data) will be of little use. Third, endogeneity means that economic realities are complex and mutable; expectations affect economic events that determine expectations (e.g. stock prices go up because people believe they will go up because stock prices are going up).
Future outcomes will be affected by current decisions based on expectations of the 
future formed today: inter-temporal feedbacks between past, present and future will de -
termine reality. Given these three sources of complexity, the objective basis for probability judgements may be missing or unknowable and the third source of complexity will un -
dermine, in the investment context, even the more subjectively-based Bayesian probabil -
ity concepts. Furthermore, cognitive limits on human information processing mean that individuals’ subjective probability estimates are fallible (e.g. see Tversky and Kahneman 1982; Baddeley, Curtis and Wood 2004).
Entrepreneurial decision-making: survey evidence
There have been many survey analyses of firms’ real-world behaviour which provide some insight into whether firms and entrepreneurs are either procedurally rational or substantively rational. A lot of the survey evidence focuses on the use of investment ap -
praisal techniques investigating the real-world use of complex algorithmic techniques versus simple heuristics such as PBP and ARR (Gordon 1955; Harcourt 1968; Sarnat and Levy 1969; Ramsey 1970; Dudley 1972; Gronchi 1986). Survey evidence reveals that heuristics such as the payback period technique and average rate of return are the techniques most commonly used, especially by small businesses (Drury et al.  1992; Neild 1964; Baddeley 
1995, 2003, 2006a).
Neild (1964) found that only 3% of engineering firms used discounting algorithms 
(Neild 1964). The majority (88%) relied on heuristics such as pay-off periods (67%) or flat rates of return (21%). Baddeley’s (1995, 2006a) survey evidence shows that firms have a range of goals including maximising sales or profits, industry leadership and growth; many mentioned the personal satisfaction of running a business, which chimes with the 238 Cor Porat E InVE StMEnt  an D F Ina nCE
emphasis on animal spirits in behavioural macroeconomics, and the entrepreneurs in this 
survey were more likely to rely on heuristics such as ARR and PBP (81% of respondents). Not only were the firms not using the algorithmic techniques but even if they were, they weren’t necessarily using them properly: in one survey, 45% of the large firms using DCF methods did not realize the importance of a suitable discount rate, for example claiming that the question was ‘not applicable’.
In Baddeley’s (1995, 2006a) survey, gut feel was identified as a key factor, especially 
for smaller firms which were using gut feel as a substitute for mathematical algorithms’ reliance on business skills and common sense. This is consistent with a procedural ration -
ality hypothesis. Gut feel was used by 28% of large businesses, 50% of medium sizes and 63% of small businesses. These findings suggest that psychological motivations are likely to have a significant impact on firms’ decision-making.
In assessing the relative optimism or pessimism of investment activity, businesses 
were asked whether past investments had matched expectations or not. Business experi -
ence, instincts and gut feel are important when entrepreneurs are forming expectations and making the final decisions about whether or not to invest in a project. In a face-to-face interview, one MD commented that,
It is difficult to assess the right approach – you would like to rely on mathematical 
calculation but don’t believe that you can – although as a tool it’s a great asset. But there will always be a gut feel, business experience element as gut feel will tell you to base future expectations on historic information. The future is multifaceted, with many possible interactions and there can be no model to predict. Can you can come up with a model more predictable than people just pooling their gut feel reactions?
Businesses were not always good at judging their performance, perhaps reflecting prob -
lems of overconfidence and underconfidence. Underperformance of investment projects 
was a function of firm size: 8% of large firms, 14% of medium-sized firms and 32% of small firms underperformed relative to their expectations. In contrast, 10% of large firms and 14% of medium-sized firms and no small firms overperformed with their invest -
ments (Baddeley 1995, 2006a).
Behavioural investment appraisal
An alternative to these approaches to investment appraisal is to incorporate some be-havioural insights into standard models. Just as NPV techniques suffer from their neglect of the uncertainty–irreversibility problem, addressed in RO approaches, in turn the RO 
approach  suffers from a neglect of behavioural biases – specifically shifting risk and time 
preferences.
As Keynes observed: 
It would be foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to matters that 
are very uncertain … The outstanding fact is the extreme precariousness of knowl -
edge  … we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years 
hence of a railway, a copper mine … an Atlantic liner ... amounts to little and sometimes to nothing.
(Keynes 1936, pp. 148–150) 239 nEoClaSSIC al t HEorY oF tHE F IrM
This is an enduring insight. Today too, investment performance forecasts must be made 
on the basis of assumptions about an inherently unknowable future. If investors are con -
cerned about uncertainty, then they will be more reluctant to invest – and so there will be a negative relationship between investment and uncertainty. The uncertainty constraint is particularly pressing for industries experiencing rapid technological change, and when lags between planning and delivery are long and complex.
One approach to incorporating insights from behavioural economics into the analysis 
of businesses’ investment and financing decisions is to incorporate key elements from behavioural economics directly into investment appraisal tools. One way to do this is to use discount functions from behavioural economics, as explained in Chapter 7 , and incor -
porate these into corporate investment and finance strategies.
These insights can be used to analyse more deeply what constrains investors’ will -
ingness to invest, especially in innovative investments, for which uncertainty will be a particular problem – and the range of biases and socio-psychological influences we’ve covered in this book all have more traction when uncertainty is profound. There are many barriers but the most complex is uncertainty. Fixed asset investment is all about the future. We postpone consumption today to invest our money in productive capacity for a future we cannot know and so fixed asset investment is plagued by uncertainty.
Added to this neglect of the uncertainty–irreversibility problem, is a problem not 
addressed in economic theories of fixed asset investment – the problem of behavioural bias. Real options theories are grounded in a rational choice framework – in which fixed asset investors are assumed to systematically and rationally use the information that they do have in forming robust and unbiased decisions. Rational choice models embed the assumption that decision-makers have stable time and risk preferences. Theoretically, the strict assumptions about rationality associated with rational choice theory are convenient for model-building and enable abstraction, but by assuming away the behavioural biases associated with shifting time and risk preferences, the conventional rational choice frame -
works can lead infrastructure investors and policy-makers to overlook significant distor -
tions in real-world behaviour. Behavioural economic theorists, drawing on insights from psychology and sociology, have comprehensively explored how rational decision-making is impeded by shifting and unstable time and risk preferences. These shifting preferences create problems of time inconsistency, present bias, loss aversion and reference depend -
ence, leading to inefficient and distorted decision-making.
The current literature on behavioural bias in investment, particularly large-scale in -
frastructure investment projects, comes from project management – namely the literature on “mega-projects”. Whilst this does address some behavioural insights, these are not framed within a robust analytical model. Nonetheless, it identifies some important in -
sights. Cost overruns are much more likely than not, either because of “lowball” tactics or other gaming behaviours by potential contractors at tender stage.
This links to a key form of bias affecting business investment and financing – 
 opt
imism 
bias. Optimism bias can be a particular problem for construction businesses where it is difficult to predict and plan for future contingencies. Optimism bias is a particular theme in the academic literature on mega-projects and is defined in this literature as “a tendency to over-estimate benefits and under-estimate costs” (BITRE 2014). The Sydney Opera House is one of the most famous examples of mega-project blowouts – coming in at nearly 1,400% over budget. In their review of 258 large transport infrastructure 240 Cor Porat E InVE StMEnt  an D F Ina nCE
investments spread across 20 countries, Flyvbjerg et al.  (2014) found that costs were un -
derestimated on average by 20 to 45%, depending on the project.
The problem is that the behavioural economic theorists have not explored these 
insights within the framework of fixed asset investment theory. For investment deci -
sions, when these distortions interact with the distortions created by the uncertainty–  
ir
reversibility problem, then the biases and inefficiencies in infrastructure investment are 
likely to be large and complex. Better models of investment decision-making, which ex -
plicitly incorporate departures from rational behaviour, are needed, so that governments 
can better understand how potential investors might respond to changes in public policy, and what the public sector can do to encourage desirable investment outcomes.
To capture some of the complexities it is possible to combine insights from investment 
theory with behavioural economics, in providing an original theoretical framework in which forms of bias created by unstable time and risk preferences are drawn together with insights from real options theories about uncertainty and irreversibility to capture aspects of behaviour not fully addressed in standard NPV appraisal techniques, which incorporate un -
realistic behavioural assumptions about how investors plan for the future based on a rational expectations approach. This way impacts on fixed asset investment of interplays between uncertainty and irreversibility as explored by  Dixit and Pindyck and others can be blended 
with behavioural insights .
In fact, time inconsistency has been addressed within some of these literatures, it 
has been addressed in a limited way as an institutional or regulatory failure, rather than as a behavioural phenomenon. Whilst some analysts have identified a problem of time inconsistency, specifically in the context of energy infrastructure, these analyses look at time inconsistency from an industrial–regulatory perspective (e.g. Helm 2009), and not by drawing on insights from behavioural economics, even though behavioural models of time inconsistency could also be used to explain the optimism bias.
Chapter summary
 •Neoclassical theories of business investment finance are based around the idea that businesses maximize profits by minimizing costs, subject to the production technol -
ogies they are using but this approach is problematic because it does not allow for behavioural bias and other insights from behavioural economics.
 •More nuanced models of business investment and finance draw on behavioural the -
ories of the firm which replace the input–output approach associated with standard economic theory with a wider analysis of business motivations and incentives.
 •Another way to conceptualize these differences is via Herbert Simon’s distinction be -
tween substantive versus procedural rationality, where  procedural rationality is about 
a more complex, less mathematical style of decision-making.
 •Survey evidence suggests that small firms use simpler techniques such as payback pe -
riods and simple profit rates and larger firms are more likely to use net present value and other discounted cash-flow techniques – though under certain assumptions these different techniques will give the same answer.
 •Standard investment and finance models can embed behavioural insights by incorporat -
ing behavioural discount function s embedding  hyperbolic or quasi-  hy

Emotional trading
As we saw in Chapter 13, mainstream financial theory is grounded in assumptions of 
rational expectations and efficient financial markets. In standard financial models, market fluctuations are the outcome of decisions by rational agents in free markets, using ob -
jective information. These theories focus on a view of people as atomistic, independent, forward-looking and self-interested agents. These agents do not make systematic mistakes and they use all available information efficiently. It is difficult fully to reconcile these models with the behaviour of financial traders and speculators in the real world, when different traders’ decisions come together to magnify financial instability on an aggregate scale – for example, speculative bubbles – as we’ll see in Chapter 17. In this chapter, we will concentrate on the individual traders and specifically how these individuals are af -
fected by moods and emotions in their trading behaviours.
There is plenty of evidence that emotions are an important driver for individual 
traders’ decisions. This builds on the ideas explored in Chapter 9: that decision-
 ma
king, 
emotion and feelings are all intertwined in the economic and financial world, even though  – until recently – economic and financial theorists have neglected the role of emo -
tions in economic decision-making (Elster 1996, 1998). As we saw in Chapter 9, Elster (1996) and Loewenstein (1996) emphasize that emotions and visceral factors are neither rational nor irrational because they cannot be chosen. The role of emotions in economic decision-making has been confirmed by other neuroscientific evidence which shows that emotional circuits in the brain operate in response to ambiguity and during learning/information processing (Glimcher and Rustichini 2004; Houser et al.  2005; Shiv et al.  2005; 
Naqvi et al. 2007). Emotions do not necessarily interfere with rationality but may be im -
portant “tie-breakers”, for example when outcomes are indeterminate in rational choice models. The influence of visceral factors varies in intensity, exerting overwhelming in -
fluences when in a “hot state” but with cognitive factors exerting more influence during “cold” states (Bernheim and Rangel 2004). This dominance of emotions may reflect in -
teractions between decision-making systems. Financial traders are often making decisions at great speed which involve very high stakes and in this sort of context hot, intuitive, automatic emotional systems are more likely to prevail over cold, reasoning, deliberative cognitive systems. 243 EMo t IonS an D tr aDIng P ErForManCE
Some of the most fascinating evidence about what drives individual traders comes 
from neurofinance – applying the tools and insights explored in the neuroeconomics 
chapters (Chapters 11 and 12) specifically to financial traders’ behaviour. The role of emo -
tions in economic decision-making has been confirmed by other neuroscientific evidence which shows that emotional circuits in the brain operate in response to ambiguity and during learning/information processing (Glimcher and Rustichini 2004; Houser et al. 
2005; Shiv et al.  2005, Naqvi et al.  2007). In this chapter, we will explore some of the evi -
dence specifically about how emotions affect emotional trading and assess these ideas in the light of evidence from a range of neurofinance studies. As we have explored in previ -
ous chapters, emotions are difficult to measure using economists’ traditional tools, which are based around studying decisions they can observe and measure. Neuroscience offers some solutions, however, as we saw in Chapters 11 and 12. Some of the tools and insights from neuroeconomics can add depth and detail to our understanding of how emotions drive financial trading and speculation specifically. For example, neuroeconomics can add some valuable additional information to these debates because tools are developing which enable us to identify specific neural areas associated with emotion. Ultimately, if these studies show that people do not necessarily use objective information in a systematic way then rational expectations and efficient markets will no longer be at the core of theoret -
ical analyses of financial markets. On the other hand, if the behavioural economists and neuroeconomists can show that economic and financial decision-making is associated with logical, rational, cognitive responses, then we could conclude that the emphasis on rationality and market efficiency may be justifiable, at least as an approximation.
Emotions and trading performance
An overarching theme in studies of how emotions influence traders’ performance reflects the idea that cognition and emotions are interacting when we make financial decisions. This focus on interactions of cognitive and emotional decision-making systems links to Keynes’s early insights about decision-making as a reflection of interactions of deliberation and emotion:
It is our innate urge to activity which makes the wheels go round, our rational selves 
choosing between the alternatives as best we are able, calculating where we can, but often falling back for our motive on whim or sentiment or chance.
(Keynes 1936, pp. 162–163)
In terms of the impact of emotion on financial decisions, some of the earliest neuroeco -
nomic studies of emotion analysed financial decision-making by lesion patients, that is, 
patients with localized damage to specific areas of the brain known to be associated with processing specific emotions. The role of emotions in economic decision-making has also been confirmed by recent neuroscientific evidence showing that emotional circuits in the brain operate in response to ambiguity and during learning/information processing (Glimcher and Rustichini 2004; Houser et al.  2005; Naqvi et al.  2007).
One of the easiest and cheapest ways to capture emotional responses when traders 
are taking risks in buying and selling financial assets is to use relatively old-fashioned physiological measurement equipment to capture simple things such as heart rate, sweat 244 EMo t Ional tra DIng
response and skin conductance. One pioneering set of studies was implemented by Lo and 
Repin (2002). They used neurophysiological techniques to monitor the responses of ten professional derivatives traders by measuring skin conductance, heart rates, muscular re -
sponses, blood pressure, respiration rates and body temperature and EMG. They analysed the differences in physiological response between traders with high levels of experience versus traders with a low to moderate level of experience. In most cases, the experienced traders were better at controlling emotions though Lo and Repin do emphasize that this does not suggest that emotions are not valuable inputs to decision-making. Similarly, Lo et al. (2005) in a study of 80 day traders find that the trading performance was significantly 
hampered for those with more intense emotional reactions. Also, there is evidence that more primitive emotions, in the form of visceral factors, are implicated in some self-
 
de
structive behaviour, as explained below.
The fact that emotions influence traders does not mean that emotions are a prob -
lem that needs to be fixed. As we explored in Chapter 9, emotions are often valuable guides to effective decision-making. From some of the lesion patient studies mentioned above, Bechara and Damasio (2005) and Damasio (1994/2006) developed the somatic marker hypothesis: emotions provide important physiological cues that can help decision-
 
ma
king. Lo and Repin postulate that experienced professional traders often draw on intui -
tion in decision-making. Intuitive decision-making rules are often propelled by emotions. The implication of their findings therefore is that experienced traders have learnt not to overreact emotionally which does not imply that they shouldn’t react emotionally at all.
In support of this idea that emotions are an important guide to good decision-making, 
some lesion patient studies suggest that damage to emotional processing areas can improve performance in restricted scenarios. Shiv et al.  (2005) studied the performance of lesion pa -
tients with damage to emotional processing areas in the brain in 20 rounds of investment decisions and they compared the performance of the lesion patients with performance by normal subjects. The normal subjects learnt quickly to select more conservative, less risky strategies but for the lesion patients, the disconnection of emotional responses enabled the lesion patients to perform better. They earned significantly greater rewards from the investment games because they did not feel risk. Shiv et al.  interpret this as evidence that 
when the processing of negative emotions, including fear of loss, is disconnected people are more likely to adopt risk-seeking strategies which earn them higher returns.
Emotions and risk-taking
A key theme in behavioural finance and neurofinance focuses on how emotions feed into traders’ perceptions of risk. Emotions play a key role in driving risk-taking. The emotions most commonly identified as contributing to financial fragility and irrational exuberance include greed, hope and fear (Shefrin 2002). Slovic et al. (2004), Slovic (2010) and Loe -
wenstein et al. (2001) characterize risk as a feeling and argue that the risks that traders feel 
during their financial transacting can be characterized as a feeling of fear – with feed -
back effects and intensifying fear responses and precipitating panics. Other emotions will affect financial decisions more broadly, the irrational exuberance of traders, commonly seen in bullish markets, may reflect an interaction of hope and greed (Shiller 2000, 2003).
The role played by affect and emotions in driving financial decision-making has 
been confirmed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showing that  245 EMotIonS a nD rISk- tak Ing
risk-seeking and risk-aversion mistakes in financial decision-making are associated with 
activation of neural circuits associated with affect and emotion (Kuhnen and Knutson 2005). Similarly, Slovic (2010) connects the feeling of risk with impulsivity and addiction. Neuroscientific evidence has established that money stimulates the same dopaminergic reward-processing systems as are activated with more basic rewards including food, sex and drugs. Reflecting evolutionary processes, hardwired instinctive emotional responses may dominate even though they are not well adapted to modern conditions. The rapid development of technologies such as computerization may have accelerated the maladap -
tation of ingrained emotional processes. For example, primitive limbic structures in the brain are often associated with impulsive emotional responses appropriate in a world in which immediate rewards were important. In primitive environments, basic resources were scarce and perishable and so quick, instinctive action was essential to avoid starva -
tion. In a modern context, these instincts may not serve a useful purpose and may in fact generate perverse behaviours such as gambling addictions.
In financial markets, risk-seeking by financial traders may reflect interactions between 
neurological systems. If emotional systems encourage risk-prone traders to take impulsive decisions, then the amplification of impulsivity in modern computerized markets will increase the fragility of the financial system. As explained in Chapter 8 , in some contexts, 
impulsive behaviours such as overconsumption, for example of addictive substances, can be overridden by pre-commitment devices but with traders’ returns focused very much on short-term performance there is little incentive for traders to rein in impulsive in -
stincts if institutional safeguards limiting impulsivity are not in place.
As we explored above, emotions including fear and greed are significant drivers of 
financial traders’ decisions – and these connect with traders’ attitudes towards risk. Lesion patient studies have been used to explore links between traders’ risk-seeking behaviours and their tendencies towards impulsivity. Shiv et al.  (2005) studied the behaviour of lesion 
patients with amygdala, orbitofrontal and insula damage and found that damage to neural emotional circuitry was associated with an increased willingness to take risks. Patients with lesions in areas associated with emotion were more willing to take risks by investing money in gambling tasks and were able to make larger profits than normal controls, per -
haps because decreased affect ameliorates the problems of myopic loss aversion.
Some of these influences have also been captured using brain imaging techniques, 
for example functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Christopoulos et al.  (2009) 
used fMRI to study traders’ risk aversion. They used fMRI to analyse participants’ choices between risky and safe options. As explained in Chapters 11 and 12, fMRI is based around the measurement of the blood’s magnetic properties using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Specifically for traders’ risk choices, Christopoulos et al.  found 
that responses in the striatum increased with the probability of a risky choice and inferior frontal gyrus responses decreased with the probability of a risky choice. They also found increased BOLD responses in the inferior frontal gyrus, an area commonly implicated in risk aversion.
Using similar techniques, Kuhnen and Knutson (2005) and Knutson and Bossaerts 
(2007) explore the role of affect in financial decision-making using event-related fMRI techniques. Kuhnen and Knutson examined the behaviour of 19 volunteers offered safe stocks and risky stocks. The subjects had to learn which were riskiest choices and Kuhnen and Knutson identified two types of mistake associated with risk-seeking and risk-aversion. 246 EMo t Ional tra DIng
These correlated with activations in neural circuits associated with emotion and affect. 
They found that distinct anticipatory affect circuits are associated with different types of financial choices. Activations in the nucleus accumbens, which forms the main part of the striatum and is associated with reward learning, were correlated with risk-seeking mistakes. Conversely, activations in the anterior insula, associated with negative emotions and fear of failure and loss, are associated with risk-aversion mistakes.
Another way to capture neural responses to risk-taking is to study the impact of hor -
mones on financial decisions. Coates and Herbert (2008) , Coates et al . (2010) and 
 H
erbert 
(2018) identify a role for steroid hormones including testosterone – often associated with 
risk-taking, and cortisol – often associated with stress. They postulate that cortisol en -
codes risk and testosterone encodes rewards. They study hormonal profiles by taking saliva samples from 17 day traders from a London trading floor. They correlate the hormo -
nal data with traders’ profit and loss (P&L) accounts and also with market events and find that when a trader’s morning testosterone level is relatively high then this correlates with better P&L performance over the day. In addition, average daily cortisol levels correlate with the volatility of traders’ P&L accounts and also with market volatility overall. These findings are mirrored in Coates et al .’s (2009) study of prenatal androgens, associated with 
success in competitive sports. Finger length, specifically the 2D:4D ratio capturing the ra -
tio of the lengths of the second finger and fourth finger, are markers of prenatal androgen levels. Coates et al.  (2009) measured the 2D:4D ratio for high-frequency traders and found 
that traders’ long-term profitability correlated with their 2D:4Ds.
Emotions, heuristics and prospect theory
Insights about heuristics and bias, and concepts from prospect theory (as outlined in Chap -
ters 3 and 4), can be applied to give us a deeper understanding of how and why attitudes towards risk connect with financial decision-making; including links with emotional pro -
cessing. Damasio (1994/2006) emphasizes that emotions play a valuable role in a lot of decision-making, they may also intensify some of the behavioural biases discussed above. Emotional factors will play a role via heuristics, particularly the availability heuristic which, as we explored in Chapter 3, is about how people make decisions using the information they have which is easiest to access and remember quickly. Emotions are prime candidates in this context. They are often at the top of minds so exert a strong influence on our decisions. Similarly, emotions have a powerful influence on our memories and so will determine what is remembered and what is forgotten. In financial markets, this powerful role played by emotions is magnified by the fast speed at which trading decisions are often made.
In a fast-moving environment, the vividness of emotions will make them more sali -
ent. This is the essence of a specific type of availability heuristic – the affect heuristic . Emo -
tions also connect with forms of bias including ambiguity aversion, described by Shefrin as fear of the unknown (2002).
Some of the gambling behaviours associated with financial trading can be explained 
in terms of key insights from prospect theory – and some neurofinance studies have fo -
cused specifically on testing hypotheses from prospect theory using neuroscientific tools. For example, Fox and Poldrack (2009) explore a range of methods for eliciting the pa -
rameters of the value function from prospect theory and review some of the key neuroe -
conomic findings from the application of prospect theory. De Martino et al.  (2006) in an  247 EMotIonal tra D Ing  an D P ErSonal ItY
fMRI study of reference dependence in gambling tasks analysed the responses of people 
offered a choice between a sure loss versus a gamble and a sure gain versus a gamble. The reflection effect was observed confirming the predictions of prospect theory. In addition, the fMRI imaging results showed differential amygdala activations for sure gains and risky losses suggesting that amygdala is associated with the coding of value.
Emotions have a place in prospect theory and there are important lessons in under -
standing financial markets. Reference points dictate our choices and this links to frame dependence , introduced in Chapter 13: how we frame our decisions is determined by 
our reference points. This suggests a link between framing, emotions and financial deci -
sion-making: Shefrin (2002) argues that frame dependence means that decisions will be affected by the context in which they are taken and this will reflect interplay of cognitive and emotional factors. Emotion and cognition also interact in responses to ambiguity aversion – a feature of our behaviour that can be captured within prospect theory but not expected utility theory. Ambiguity aversion links to emotions; Shefrin analyses it as fear of the unknown.
Emotional trading and personality
Lo et al. (2005) separate the impact of mood and personality on financial decision-making 
by day traders by correlating responses to daily surveys of emotions and personality with traders’ profit and loss records. Subjects with more intense emotional reactions to mon -
etary gains and losses performed less well. Lo et al. conclude that extreme moods impair 
trading performance but that good trading performance is not significantly associated with specific personality traits. They focus on mood as a reflection of exogenous factors rather than individual differences and conclude that any individual can be a good trader if they have the appropriate training and experience.
Theoretically, the influence of personality on traders’ behaviour can be captured us -
ing psychoanalytical principles, for example, in David Tuckett’s Emotional Finance Model. Tuckett (2009, 2011) analyses traders’ emotions using a psychoanalytical approach, bring -
ing together some of these insights about the role of emotion in financial decision-making using psychoanalytical principles and insights from psychological interviews of real-world fund and portfolio managers. He argues that financial instability is created by emotional conflicts. Financial assets are perceived as something much more than a store of value. Traders pursue them as “phantastic objects” – objects imbued with superlative qualities. In pursuit of phantastic objects, whether these be tulip bulbs, houses or dotcom shares, traders are susceptible to divided state of mind and emotional conflicts because the excite -
ment of potential gains is separated from the anxiety, panic and fear induced by potential losses. In a euphoric phase, traders quickly forget the losses from previous busts. During a speculative bubble, traders forget quickly about the losses from previous busts and con -
struct stories to rationalize their impulsive behaviours. Bubbles and busts are generated as path-dependent emotional sequences. Euphoric booms are followed by emotional oscilla -
tions concluding in spectacular collapses of confidence as bubbles burst.
In their divided state, traders construct stories to exaggerate positive potential and 
rationalize negative experiences. This generates biases of over-optimism leading to un -
derestimation of risk and overvaluation of opportunities. Speculative frenzies may be propelled, at least partly, by these unconscious instincts – generating bubbles, booms and 248 EMo t Ional tra DIng
busts as path-dependent emotional sequences in which euphoric booms are followed by 
a period of emotional oscillation during which people struggle to reconcile reality with their beliefs , culminating in “spectacular” collapses of confidence as the bubble bursts.
These tendencies are exacerbated by “groupthink” within a “basic assumption group”, 
that is, a group formed around a common belief in some fundamental assumption(s); for financial markets, where the basic assumptions are rational agents and efficient markets. 
Mirroring psychological insights about cognitive dissonance, Tuckett postulates that the basic assumption group in financial markets does not challenge assumptions of rational expectations and efficient markets. Instead, contradictory information is rationalized or dismissed as noise; stories are constructed to ameliorate doubt and distrust. This means that no one takes responsibility for past failures and so learning from past mistakes is limited or non-existent.
Tuckett emphasizes that the impact of emotional factors does not reflect irrational -
ity. The problem is that financial market institutions have been distorted by emotional conflicts and this partly reflects the essential characteristics of financial assets. Financial markets are volatile. Financial assets are abstract and intangible; and it is difficult for a trader to judge their own performance. Leveraging, that is gearing up purchases of finan -
cial assets with borrowings to magnify the net returns, has exacerbated the potential for overinvestment during euphoric phases. Also, a lot of financial market activity has been directed towards securing comfort and reassurance rather than identifying the real rea -
sons why things went wrong. Tuckett suggests solutions that focus on extracting the glam -
our and excitement from people’s perceptions of financial trading. Developing statistical barometers of financial market temperature can be used to restrict financial innovations or increase capital ratios during fragile times when markets are heating up.
Financial herding
One key channel via which emotions affect traders’ decisions is via the phenomenon of herding. Financial traders are as prone to social influences (introduced in Chapter 6 ) 
as any other decision-maker – perhaps more so because they are dealing with scenar -
ios in which outcomes are fundamentally uncertain. Partly, traders’ susceptibility to fol -
lowing the crowd, as for anyone’s susceptibility to social influence, may reflect the fact that tendencies to follow the crowd reflect socialization: from childhood onwards, we learn to respond to others around us, building on our hardwired evolved instincts to imitate – an essential part of our character as social animals. These responses manifest themselves in financial markets too , meaning that social emotions encourage traders to 
respond to group pressure (Baddeley 2018). In financial markets, emotions have par -
ticularly strong power, partly because modern financial markets move so fast and also because of uncertainty about what might happen next with asset prices – will they go up or down? Most of the time this is impossible to predict, and so what others are doing has a disproportionate  impact.
In volatile markets, when an individual trader panics then their panic can precipi -
tate “social panics”, reflecting an interplay between risk, anxiety and fear (Loewenstein et al. 2007).
Neuroscientific techniques can enable the identification of the neural correlates of 
these social influences. Various studies have tested hypotheses about the theory of mind  249 FInan CIal  H ErDIng
and empathy and these have implications for understanding herding in financial markets. 
There is evidence that socialized instincts to imitate are associated with mirror neuron activity (Iacobini 2005; Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004). This may suggest that herding re -
sponses are automatic and “hardwired” and the outcome of impulsiveness. Single-cell re -
cordings in monkeys have identified mirror neurons in the premotor cortex (PFC) which fire not only when monkeys perform grabbing movements but also when the monkeys observe similar movements performed by experimenters (Rizzolatti et al.  2002). Extend -
ing this finding, experiments show that monkeys’ socialized  instincts are also propelled 
by the activity of mirror neurons and these insights have been extended to describe hu -
man instincts to follow others (e.g. see Iacobini 2005; Rizzolatti et al.  2002; Rizzolatti and 
Craighero 2004). Baddeley et al . (2005) suggest that mirror neuron activity may explain 
imitation and herding in socio-economic contexts too.
Herding can also be conceptualized as the outcome of interacting thought processes 
linking into neuroeconomic insights about the interaction of the cognitive, controlled, emotional and automatic responses (Baddeley 2010). Learning from others using Bayes’s rule would be an objective way of deciding but a cognitive impression formed via Bayes -
ian reasoning may interact with less objective emotional processing. If economic behav -
iour, herding and other forms of social influence included, reflect interactions of different neurological systems then a neuroeconomic approach, which blends economics, psychol -
ogy and evolutionary biology with social neuroscience, will provide an explanation of herding as the product of both cognition and emotion. An interdisciplinary approach is essential to understanding how and why herding and social influence evolve in an eco -
nomic and financial context.
In distinguishing social learning from social influence more generally, there are a 
number of neuroeconomic studies that explore some of the neural correlates of social influence. Berns et al. ’s (2005) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies 
of visual mental rotation tasks incorporate Asch’s ideas about social conformity (de-scribed in Chapter 6 ). Berns et al.  found that conformity is associated with activation in 
the occipital-parietal network, particularly when following incorrect signals from oth -
ers. On the other hand, amygdala and caudate activation is associated with independent decision-making.
Klucharev et al. (2009) identify a link between social conformity and learning using 
an fMRI study to show that conformity draws on mechanisms that reflect reinforcement learning principles. They found that conflict with social opinions led to differential ac -
tivations in the rostral cingulate and the ventral striatum, areas also activated in models of reward prediction error, as explored in Chapter 5 . Klucharev et al.  (2011) extend these 
insights in a study of social influence applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques. As explained in Chapter 11 , these techniques involve applying electromag -
netic induction for temporary, benign stimulation of specific neural areas.
Klucharev et al.’s subjects were sorted into three groups: a control group; a “sham” 
TMS group receiving sub-threshold levels of TMS; and a TMS group. Then, they were asked to participate in a two-stage “seeing beauty” task: they were asked to record their perceptions about the attractiveness of a series of photos of female faces. In the first stage, they were asked for an initial rating of the attractiveness of the faces on an 8-point scale. They were then given social information about others’ perceptions of attractiveness using the average ratings from all the experimental subjects. In the second stage, the subjects 250 EMo t Ional tra DIng
were asked again to rate the attractiveness of phases. The TMS group received TMS inhib -
iting the activity of the neurons in the posterior medial frontal cortex – an area involved 
in reward prediction – before they gave their second-stage ratings. Overall, Klucharev et al. found that the ratings from the control and sham groups were responsive to the in -
formation about average perceptions; however, the TMS group experienced significant reductions in conformity in their ratings of attractiveness after receiving TMS. Klucharev et al. conclude that this confirms the link between social conformity and reinforcement 
learning.
Burke et al. (2010b) develop these neuroeconomic analyses of social learning and 
conformity specifically in the context of financial herding. They use fMRI techniques to analyse social influence in financial decision-making. They show that when subjects are offered the opportunity to buy versus reject a stock, the ventral striatum is differentially activated if subjects’ decisions coincide with decisions of a group. Furthermore, when subjects were balancing social information about a group’s decisions against private in -
formation in the form of stock charts capturing a stock’s historical performance, the probabilities of buying conditioned on social information correlated with differential ac -
tivations in the ventral striatum – an area associated with emotional processing of reward.
Other fMRI studies have been used to capture social influences on traders’ decisions. 
Burke et al. (2010b) analysed neural activations when players were deciding between 
social information about a group’s opinion and private information about the recent performance of a financial stock. Related analyses also suggested that amygdala and ventral striatum activation might correlate with conformist decisions (buying a stock when a group is buying it) versus contrarian decisions (buying a stock when the group is not buying it) depending on an individual’s characteristics and personality traits. As 
explained above, the ventral striatum is implicated in reward processing. Other studies have shown that the amygdala is implicated in aversive learning, that is, when people are feeling fearful.
Weaker rationality assumptions can be maintained if traders’ herding behaviours are 
still the outcome of calculations based on mathematical algorithms. In Bayesian mod -
els, for example (as we saw in Chapter 6 ), prior probability judgements are being up -
dated systematically and logically using others’ actions as new information arrives (e.g. see 
 Ba
nerjee 1992; Bikhchandani et al.  1992; Chamley 2003). From a Bayesian perspective, 
a rational agent will use every bit of available information, including social information about the actions of others. Herding can be understood as an extension of principles of rational behaviour whilst nonetheless allowing that human actions are not necessarily independent. Bayesian models explain herding in the form of information cascades as a process of sequential learning on a microeconomic scale with people updating probabili -
ties sequentially as the decisions of other individuals are revealed.
Emotions play a key role in traders’ susceptibility to social influences. Some neuro -
finance studies have shown that brain areas associated with the processing of fear are activated when financial decisions are affected by herding influences. Burke et al.  (2010b) 
and Baddeley et al.  (2010), again using fMRI evidence, analyse differential activations for 
herding decisions (decisions to buy a stock when the group buys and reject it when the group rejects) versus contrarian decisions (decisions to reject when the group buys and buy when the group rejects). As shown in Figure 15.1, financial herding is associated with differential activations in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex. 251 FInan CIal  H ErDIng
These differential activations suggest a role for fear because the amygdala is com -
monly associated with aversive learning and the emotional processing of fear. Overall, the 
evidence about the differential activations in the ventral striatum and amygdala suggest that there may be interactions between fear, social reinforcement learning and reward in financial decision-making.
~
In this chapter, we have explored the various ways in which emotions affect financial traders’ decision-making – and the impact of emotions is particularly pronounced for traders because they are often making decisions in the context of profound uncertainty and limited information. This means that emotions may be an important guide for them  and if these emotional responses are capturing something of their implicit knowl -
edge and intuition, then the role played by emotions in driving trading is not necessarily a bad thing. When emotions distort perceptions of risk, however, their role will be less benign. When the negative impacts of emotions – for example, in magnifying risk-loving or risk-
 av
oiding behaviours in the context of fear and greed – are significant and particu -
larly when magnified further by the social influences that encourage traders to follow the 4

Chapter summary
 •The financial trading decisions of individual traders and speculators are often driven by interactions between reason and emotion.
 •The impact of emotions on trading does not necessarily mean that trading will be poorly informed as – consistent with Antonio Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis introduced in Chapter 9 – emotions can be a good guide to decision-making.
 •Emotions such as greed and fear determine traders’ perceptions of risk and this affects their trading patterns.
 •Heuristics and bias in traders’ decision-making can reflect emotional influences, for example via the affect heuristic which is about how decision-makers use emotions as a decision-making guide because emotions are quick and easy to remember.
 •Traders’ emotions are also determined by social influences – specifically financial herding which often has a powerful influence in situations where the future pros -
pects for financial assets are uncertain and hard to predict.

Macroeconomics and financial 
systemsChapter 16
Behavioural macroeconomics
Behavioural economics is mostly about microeconomic phenomena and the concepts fo -
cus on the motivations underlying individual behaviour. Applying these microeconomic 
principles to macroeconomic analysis is complicated by the limits to aggregation. Whilst standard models aggregate, by assumption, from atomistic representative agents, behav -
ioural economics focuses on individual differences, social interactions, behavioural biases and non-rational forces including emotions and visceral factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to aggregate. Behavioural influences mean that the macroeconomy cannot be a simple sum of its parts.
Whilst little has been done on behavioural macroeconomics it is nonetheless impor -
tant to understand how and why behavioural factors affect macroeconomic outcomes. This chapter attempts to put together some ideas and insights from behavioural eco -
nomics to enable a better understanding of how and why the psychology of individuals affects the macroeconomy. To understand how and why behavioural insights are so im -
portant in developing a stronger foundation for macroeconomic theory and policy, it is important to understand why and how mainstream macroeconomics is constrained by its theoretical structure once psychological influences are brought into the analysis. So, we will start with an exploration of some of the foundations of the dominant paradigm in 
 ma
croeconomics – built on the microfoundations of neoclassical economics, which we 
explored in previous chapters.
Mainstream macroeconomics
As we explored in Part II in the context of financial decision-making, behavioural eco nomics 
offers alternatives to the microeconomic assumptions usually embedded in economic theory. In orthodox macroeconomic theory, stringent assumptions are used to construct aggregate models and these are needed because otherwise it is not easy to capture how the actions of different “agents” – the constituent parts of the macroeconomy – come together in the macroeconomy as whole. By embedding some assumptions, all the workers/consumers  256 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
and employers/producers in the economy can easily be added together. To enable this ag -
gregation, macroeconomists make some more assumptions, including:
a. The rational expectations hypothesis – which we explored in Part II in the context of finan -
cial decision-making. This is about very clever, well-informed agents responding 
quickly and efficiently to the arrival of new information so they do not make sys -
tematic mistakes.
b. The representative agents hypothesis  (RAH) that the average behaviour of all agents within a 
group can be described by the behaviour of one representative agent. For example, if the representative household is a utility maximizer then this describes the behaviour of all households. For example, if the RAH works well then aggregate consumption across the whole macroeconomy can be calculated just by multiplying the behaviour of a rep -
resentative household by the number of households in the macroeconomy as a whole.
c. Consumption smoothing , that is, people aim for a steady stream of consumption over 
their lifetimes and are enabled in this by an ability to save or borrow via perfect financial markets.
d. Ricardian equivalence : rational agents view different forms of government finance as 
equivalent. If governments finance spending via borrowing to keep taxes low today, then rational agents will realize that today’s relatively large disposable incomes are ephemeral and government borrowings will have to be repaid via higher taxes in the future. A rational consumption smoother will plan for these future tax rises by cutting consumption today and saving more for tomorrow.
In macroeconomics, aggregation does introduce additional problems for standard models and, in developing a good behavioural theory, we confront the same dilemma. Whilst be -
havioural economics almost by definition abandons the representative agents hypothesis this does still generate questions about how we can understand the macroeconomy and financial markets if there is heterogeneity amongst people, though this problem can be addressed to some extent via agent-based modelling in which sub-populations of agents are characterized using different behavioural assumptions.
keynes’s psychology of the macroeconomy
One of the pioneers in bringing psychological influences into macroeconomic analysis was renowned 20th-century economist, John Maynard Keynes. Keynes’s major work was The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money but some of the key insights were developed much earlier in his career, specifically in his A Treatise on Probability (Keynes 1921), which was based around his undergraduate dissertation. In this book, rather than constructing a model of rationality and assuming that all economic agents behave accordingly, Keynes explores the limits of individual rationality and the impact of socio-psychological forces on macroeconomic phenomena. Psychological motivations mean that different people will behave in different ways. Some economists conclude that Keynes’s analysis is based on an underlying assumption of rationality given uncertainty, reflecting themes devel -
oped in A Treatise on Probability (Littleboy 1990, Bateman 1990, Skidelsky 1992, and Dow and Dow 1985). In contrast, Shackle (1955, 1967, 1972), Winslow (1986) and Mini (1990) emphasize the subjectivism of economic behaviour and, to them, Keynes presents the  257 kEY nES’S P SYCH o log Y oF tHE MaCr oECono MY
volatile characteristics of the economy emerging as a result of “irrational forces, vicious 
tendencies, destructive fetishes and dangerous human proclivities”.
Some analyses reconcile these views, arguing that Keynes describes behaviour which is 
not strictly rational in a standard sense but is nonetheless reasonable in a broader sense and consistent with Herbert Simon’s concepts of bounded and procedural rationality, explored in Chapter 14  (Minsky 1975; Lawson 1981; Carabelli 1988; Littleboy 1990; Runde 1997; 
 Dav
idson 1991; Crotty 1992; Baddeley 1995; and Howitt 1997, amongst others). For exam -
ple, expectations and conventions are sensible and reasonable rather than strictly rational or irrational; they are not like customs/habits, they reflect rational, purpose-
 ori
ented be -
haviour under uncertainty and they promote coherent behaviour (Littleboy 1990).
keynes’s fundamental psychological laws
Keynes was unusual amongst economists in that he constructed a model of the macroe -
conomy that focused on the impact of psychological forces. Keynes (1936, 1937) argued that economic and financial decision-making is driven by a series of “fundamental psy -
chological laws”: the propensity to consume, attitudes to liquidity and expectations of returns from investment. Psychological forces are important when the world is uncertain: decision-making is fragile because uncertainty and knowledge are very precarious and it is difficult to form reliable predictions of future events.
Expectations and the state of confidence
Expectations are central to Keynes’s psychological analysis of the macroeconomy. He ar -
gues that entrepreneurs, when making decisions about the scale of their production, do not have just one expectation about future production and profits but a bundle of expecta -
tions held with varying degrees of probability and weight. When it comes to choices how -
ever, the entrepreneur will act as if his/her behaviour is the outcome of one undoubting expectation held with certainty and will utilize the expectation with the greatest weight (Keynes 1936, p. 24). Aside from some esoteric differences, Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) concept of weight in the prospect theory weighting function parallels the concept of weight in Keynes (1921, 1936). Keynes (1936) argues that rational judgements of weight underlie the convention of assuming that current events and recent results can proxy for short-term expectations (Keynes 1936, p. 51).
Weight also determines the state of confidence – a global, diffuse force similar to 
Prechter and Parker’s (2007) socionomic concept of social mood. The state of confidence affects a number of macroeconomic phenomena. It plays a crucial role in determining in -
vestment indirectly because it affects profit expectations and demand for money. A weak -
ening state of confidence is associated with lower weights and higher liquidity premiums. When the state of confidence is buoyant, judgements of weight are possible. When the state of confidence becomes more fragile, judgements of weight are more difficult. In the latter case, there will be no guide to rational action and non-rational forces will predomi -
nate. The state of confidence is not analysed in much detail in standard economic analyses and Keynes argues that our understanding of it must be based on empirical observation rather than a priori  theory.
Keynes’s analysis also links to Tversky and Kahneman’s (1974) analysis of heuristics 
and biases, in particular the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Keynes observes that 258 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
recently realized results will be weighted heavily when expectations are formed because 
using more rigorous but complicated methods of forming forecasts of the future will be disproportionately costly. In this way, Keynes uses the concept of weight to explain the heuristics that determine business confidence:
It is reasonable, therefore, to be guided to a considerable degree by the facts about 
which we feel somewhat confident, even though they may be less decisively relevant to the issue than other facts about which our knowledge is vague and scanty.
(Keynes 1936, p. 148)
Macroeconomic conventions
In Keynes’s model, conventions play a key role in determining the state of long-term ex -
pectation, a force that has significant impacts on entrepreneurship and investment (Keynes 
1936, pp. 152–153) According to Keynes, conventions may be rational, non-  ra
tional or  
irrational/psychological depending on the nature of belief underlying them; for example, the convention of assuming that the existing situation will persist appears to combine rational and non-rational elements because it is based in knowledge:
We are assuming, in effect, that the existing market valuation... is uniquely correct 
in relation to our existing knowledge of the facts which will influence the yield of an investment, and that it will only change in proportion to changes in this knowledge.
(Keynes, 1936, p. 152)
Keynes argues that the “conventional valuation which is established as the outcome of the 
mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals is liable to change violently” (Keynes 1936, p. 154). Keynes’s conventions have both a reasonable and a psychological element: they become self-fulfilling prophecies and therefore to assume that they will continue becomes the most reasonable thing to believe, once the convention is established (Lawson 1995). Also, it is reasonable for an ignorant individual to rely on conventions because other economic actors may be acting on better information and “we endeavour to fall back on the judgement of the rest of the world which is perhaps better informed” (Keynes 1936, p. 217). This links to the social learning theories analysed in Chapter s 4 
and 15 . Conventions are maintained by psychological factors: people prefer stable routines; 
conventions lull anxiety created by uncertainty about the future (Lawson 1995; Earl 1983).
It is difficult to analyse conventions because they reflect the overlap between individ -
ual and aggregate behaviour and are associated with feedback effects: aggregate behaviour affects individual behaviour and vice versa. It may not be rational for one individual to believe in isolation that the current state of affairs can be projected into the future, but outcomes are determined by aggregate behaviour and so a conventional belief held by many that the current situation is a sensible guide to the future does have a reasonable basis. What is individually rational and what is socially rational are different things, an insight also offered by Vernon L. Smith in his analysis of the links between social ration -
ality and individual irrationality in ecological rationality (Smith 2003a) .
Keynes also explained how conventions and behavioural biases affect money markets 
and attitudes towards money. For example, in the determination of interest rates: although the rate of interest is established by convention, dealers nonetheless perceive it to have an objective basis. The belief that the interest rate has its roots in objective grounds may lead  259 kEY nES’S P SYCH o log Y oF tHE MaCr oECono MY
to an inappropriate complex of interest rates prevailing due to these mistaken beliefs. This 
may lead to suboptimal levels of employment being maintained over periods of time as the conventional, relatively stable but high long-term rate of interest prevails. Some psycholog -
ical analyses of money draw on Freudian psychodynamic themes in Keynes. For example, Winslow (1986) applies money-loving instincts and Freud’s analysis of the anal personality, characterized by a triad of traits including miserliness, orderliness and cleanliness. In this way, Winslow blends ideas from Freud and Keynes to explain attitudes towards money.
Entrepreneurial animal spirits
In Keynes’s analysis, psychological factors also propel business entrepreneurs facing uncer -
tainty. Entrepreneurs have “sanguine temperament and constructive impulses” embarking on “business as a way of life”. It is impossible to predict the long-term future prospects of a new enterprise so those that do start up new businesses are not preoccupied with quan -
tifying profit expectations. The psychological force of “animal spirits” takes over “so that the thought of ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers... is put aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectations of death”. The problem comes because entrepreneurs are easily discouraged by crises of confidence and adverse economic, political and social changes will slow entrepreneurial investment; thus, slumps and depressions are exacerbated.
According to Keynes, entrepreneurs will be guided by conventions in the same way 
that speculators are guided by them, but they will also be affected by broader socio-
 
ps
ychological forces too, in particular animal spirits. The existence of animal spirits was 
postulated by Galen, an ancient Roman physician, who asserted that “ spiritus animalis ” had 
origins in the brain and mediated nerve function.
Linking Galen’s animal spirits with economics, Keynes introduced animal spirits in 
his analysis of entrepreneurship: entrepreneurs cannot properly calculate the future ben -
efits of investments because the future is not easily quantifiable. Keynes describes entre -
preneurial animal spirits as a spontaneous urge to act and intervene, even when there is no rational basis for action. He observes that most decisions:
to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many 
days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits – of spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantita -
tive benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities. Enterprise only pretends to itself to be mainly actuated by the statements in its own prospectus, however candid and sincere. Only a little more than an expedition to the South Pole, is it based on an exact calculation of benefits to come.
(Keynes 1936, pp. 161–162)
Keynes’s analysis of animal spirits also emphasizes the role of emotions including hope 
and fear:
Thus if the animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism falters, leaving 
us to depend on nothing but a mathematical expectation, enterprise will fade and die; – though fears of loss may have a basis no more reasonable than hopes of profits had before.
(ibid, p. 162)
Entrepreneurs’ reliance on animal spirits reflects uncertainty and limits on quantification.260 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
As Dow and Dow (2011) emphasize, Keynes did not describe animal spirits as an ir -
rational phenomenon and so the concept does not fit easily into economists’ dichotomous 
categories of rational/irrational. For entrepreneurial investment decisions in particular, a large number of alternatives exist and none are obviously more rational than the others. If it is not possible to rank alternatives, then entrepreneurs will be driven by motivations which are not rational in the sense of being evaluated in terms of consequences but are instead determined by psychological forces:
Generally speaking, in making a decision we have before us a large number of alterna -
tives, none of which is demonstrably more ‘rational’ than the others, in the sense that 
we can arrange in order of merit the sum aggregate of the benefits obtainable from each. [Therefore] we fall back... on motives of another kind, which are not rational in the sense of being concerned with the evaluation of consequences but are decided by habit, instinct, preference, desire [and] will.
(Keynes 1979, p. 294)
Agents are nonetheless doing the best that they can in the circumstances and this concep -
tion of rational behaviour is consistent with Simon’s concept of procedural rationality in 
which agents’ actions are the outcome of appropriate deliberation (Simon 1979).
In terms of the concepts in A Treatise on Probability , if animal spirits are a desirable force, 
then they can be justified as a form of rational action  even though they do not emerge 
from a rational belief, that is, a probability judgement. With uncertainty, knowledge will be vague. There may be no information available on which entrepreneurs can base their expectations. Two courses of action are available: they can rely instead on non-rational forces to drive behaviour or they can do nothing. Doing nothing delivers nothing. Often, it is better to rely on animal spirits and spontaneous urges to act. Relying on animal spirits will not necessarily be an irrational action  even though there is no basis for rational belief .
a behavioural analysis of macroeconomic 
in
teractions
The assumptions of macroecnoomic theory outlined at the beginning of this chapter, and Keynes’s analysis of psychological forces in the macroeconomy are very different ways of thinking about macroeconomic phenomena, so how can we reconcile them? Keynes’s concepts of conventions and animal spirits are a crucial link developed in behavioural macroeconomic theory. Often, behavioural macroeconomics starts with something like the microeconomic foundations from orthodox macroeconomic theory. These main -
stream approaches have been influential in macroeconomic policy-making and are often grounded in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. These models are dynamic because they capture decisions over time and they are stochastic because they in -
corporate a random element. Perhaps more importantly, they are founded on the rigorous microfoundations of general equilibrium theory in which firms and workers/households interact in supplying labour and producing goods/services. General equilibrium models rest on a range of assumptions about rational maximizing agents, perfect information, perfectly functioning markets and full employment, amongst other 
 as
sumptions  – as 
noted above. One crucial behavioural assumption to this, that we introduced at the start of this chapter, is the representative agent hypothesis: macroeconomic outcomes are  261 a B EH aVIoUr al anal YSI S oF MaCr oECono MI C IntEraCtIonS
understood in terms of interactions between homogeneous workers and firms – with 
individual differences and interactions generally relegated to stochastic error terms. This reflects a general characteristic of standard macroeconomic models. They often describe the behaviour of a very small number of representative individuals – multiplied.
Behavioural economics and DSGE models do not rest easily together. In addition, 
whilst the standard macroeconomic approach is prone to aggregation problems (the whole is not necessarily equal to the sum of its parts, even if the parts are the same on average), behavioural macroeconomics faces substantial additional challenges. It is in -
consistent with the essence of a behavioural approach to use one representative agent to describe general behaviour. Individual differences, not only in risk aversion and time preference, but also in cognitive skills, personality traits and emotional predispositions, are central to behavioural economics. And, even if representative agents can be described, it is not consistent with behavioural economics to assume that they act independently: they will interact with each other in response to social learning, social pressures and so -
cial preferences. These problems mean that behavioural macroeconomic theory will have to take a different approach.
Akerlof (2002) assessed the progress towards the development of behavioural macro -
economic theory, arguing that the standard approaches did not convincingly address mac -
roeconomic problems such as involuntary unemployment and under-saving. He assessed the progress of behavioural macro in terms of relaxing assumptions of perfect informa -
tion (in literatures on asymmetric information), capturing involuntary unemployment in terms of social preferences such as fairness and reciprocity, using cognitive psychology to capture monetary policy-making, introducing prospect theory into the analysis of nom -
inal wage resistance, incorporating time inconsistency into savings models using hyper -
bolic discounting function, and developing analyses of heuristics and biases to capture irrational exuberance in asset markets. Akerlof’s assessment of behavioural macro, along with insights from Keynes, led to the development of Akerlof and Shiller’s model of ani -
mal spirits in the macroeconomy, as described in more detail below.
Following from Keynes, in behavioural macroeconomics, actors can be divided in 
four key sets of players – equivalent to the agents in standard macroeconomic models: firms, households/workers, speculators and government. But whilst the agents and actors are roughly divided in the same way, the behavioural assumptions made about their mo-tivations and interactions are very different in behavioural macroeconomics. In standard macroeconomics, agents are like mathematical machines – looking just at the economic drivers. By contrast, in behavioural macroeconomic models, the actors will each be af -
fected by the range of psychological/behavioural influences – paralleling some of Keynes’s insights about psychological drivers. Different agents within the 
 ma
croeconomy  – whether 
consumers, entrepreneurs, investors, speculators, employers or workers – will be affected by moods and emotions in different ways, partly reflecting the fact that moods and emo -
tions correlate with risk-taking. An employee may – on average at least – be less likely to take risks than a speculator, for example. Effective decision-making will be constrained by cognitive biases and time inconsistency. Social influences have strong impacts human decision-making and people will tend to herd behind conventional wisdoms and actions.
Different groups will be affected in different ways. At a household level, individual 
differences such as age, education, income and socio-economic background will affect people’s susceptibility to psychological constraints. Psychological factors and individual 262 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
differences will partly explain the vulnerability of some households/individuals to fi -
nancial fraud and exploitation. Households, speculators and entrepreneurs will interact 
and their psychologies will coalesce to affect the general state of confidence, generating self-fulfilling speculative episodes and financial fragility, especially when regulatory insti -
tutions are not designed to take account of these vulnerabilities.
For business, entrepreneurs will be affected by fluctuations in mood and emotion, 
loosely categorized as animal spirits. They will be less susceptible to time inconsistency and herding because they will be more far-sighted than speculators and households. Spec -
ulators will be strongly affected by emotions such as fear and greed; there will be dif -
ferences between professionals and amateurs with amateurs more susceptible to herding tendencies, time inconsistency and other forms of cognitive bias. Households will be particularly susceptible to cognitive bias and time inconsistency.
A key contribution to the behavioural macroeconomic literature that captures some 
of these interactions is George Akerlof and Robert Shiller’s book Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism (2009). Akerlof and Shiller develop Keynes’s analysis of the psychological forces in the macroeconomy to build a macroeconomic analysis based on the animal spirits of workers, savers, speculators and governments as well as entrepreneurs. In this, they extend Keynes’s concept of animal spirits in order to capture a wide range of macroeconomic phenomena including financial crisis, depression and involuntary unemployment. They define animal spirits broadly, as the psychological factors affecting human behaviour (Akerlof and Shiller 2009).
They define five animal spirits: confidence, fairness, corruption, money illusion and 
storytelling – the narratives that shape our sense of self and others. Many of these non-
 
ra
tional forces are caught up with socio-psychological motivations and whilst these are 
woolly concepts and therefore difficult to analyse, there is increasing evidence that they are relevant. Akerlof and Shiller argue that non-economic motivations, such as irrational -
ity and the animal spirits, are central to human decision-making. “You pick the time. You pick the country. And you can be fairly well guaranteed that you will see at play in the macroeconomy the animal spirits that are the subject of this book” (Akerlof and Shiller 2009, p. 171).
Akerlof and Shiller’s animal spirits will interact. If the state of confidence is strong and 
people are optimistic, then the macroeconomy will be vulnerable to waves of euphoria, optimism. Some of these ideas about optimism have empirical support from neurosci -
entific studies. Sharot et al.  (2007) used fMRI methods to examine overoptimism whilst 
subjects imagined the contrast between positive and negative future events. They found that optimism is associated with differential activations in the amygdala (associated with emotional processing) and the anterior cingulate cortex, both areas associated with emo -
tional processing. Abnormalities in these areas are also associated with depression and pessimism.
The downside of optimism is that it is linked to speculators’ overconfidence, which 
can precipitate herding and speculative bubbles. Optimism bias in the macroeconomy also has its mirror image when macroeconomies tip over towards pessimism bias. When the state of confidence is weak and people are pessimistic, the macroeconomy will be prone to slumps and financial crises. These forces will spread via storytelling, word of mouth and false intuitions – for example, the false intuition that house prices can’t fall – feeding herding and contagion, all perturbed by anything from dramatic news stories to  263 a B EH aVIoUr al anal YSI S oF MaCr oECono MI C IntEraCtIonS
sporting events. Asset prices will be susceptible to feedback loops, with instability further 
magnified by leverage with knock-on effects for the real economy as  herding and specu -
lative bubbles exacerbat e instability , affecting wealth, investment, and the availability of 
finance. In this way, Akerlof and Shiller’s animal spirits determine market trends.
Akerlof and Shiller also identify other social influences as the product of animal spir -
its because market confidence is a form of social information and stories including the form of naïve folk wisdoms about financial market trends are communicated via social interactions. Akerlof and Shiller use an example of house prices: the story that spread before the collapse in US housing markets was that house prices could only go up; they could never go down. Markets fluctuate erratically; reflecting social mood, and waves of euphoria, optimism and overconfidence will be followed by slumps of pessimism and crises of confidence, all spreading through the economy via herding and contagion. These are fed by word of mouth and false intuitions (such as that prices don’t fall) and perturbed by a wide range of catalysts from dramatic news stories to unexpected sporting results.
Overall, Akerlof and Shiller acknowledge that psychological and sociological analyses 
are often eschewed in standard macroeconomic analysis because they are arbitrary and difficult to quantify but nonetheless they advocate a move away from economists’ typical antipathy towards socio-psychological explanations. They emphasize the importance of history and stories, and of qualitative alongside quantitative analysis (see also Dow and D ow 2011).
Consumption and saving
Akerlof and Shiller (2009) apply their conception of animal spirits specifically to the puz -
zle of consumption and savings. In standard macroeconomic models, consumption and saving by individual households are key driving variables. Consumption drives aggregate demand and can help to contribute to economic growth within an economy. Households’ savings help to support businesses’ investment in building their capital stock – as we saw in Chapter 14. The importance of consumption versus savings differs across the differ -
ent approaches to economic theory. Keynesian economists, drawing on essential insights from Keynes, tend to highlight the importance of consumption over saving in driving macroeconomic demand. Orthodox macroeconomic theories often focus on savings as the ultimate driver of macroeconomic growth. This is not the book to explore the mac -
roeconomic debates within economics about the relative importance of savings versus consumption. Here we will focus on how behavioural influences affect consumption and savings. Akerlof and Shiller draw on experimental evidence from the application of the mental accounting models (introduced in Chapter 1 3) which analyse the limited fungi -
bility of money: money will be perceived in different ways in different circumstances. Experiments show that people experiencing a windfall gain of $2,400 will consume dif -
ferent proportions depending on the circumstances and context in which the windfall is received. If they receive a windfall as a sum to be spread over a series of monthly pay -
ments, then they will spend $1,200. If it’s a single lump sum then they spend £785 . If it 
is received as an inheritance then they spend nothing. Rather than treating economic de -
cisions together as one gigantic maximization problem, people assign different events to separate “mental” accounts. These insights help to explain why people accumulate credit card debt at high interest rates whilst simultaneously saving at low interest rates – perhaps 264 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
explained by ideas about mental accounting developed by Richard Thaler and the broader 
behavioural literature about how people’s decisions are affected by cues and frames. In terms of mental accounting: if people are using different mental accounts for debt versus savings, then it is not so surprising that they hold debt and savings at the same time – especially once liquidity constraints are taken into account too.
As we saw in Chapter 7 , a large volume of experimental evidence from experimental 
psychology as well as economics shows that individuals’ discount functions are not stable and people tend to exhibit disproportionate impatience in the short run. The standard exponential discounting model predicts that if a person is making a choice in two situa -
tions then those choices should be stable over time. Experimental evidence shows people preferring to take rewards sooner when choosing for the short term than when deciding over longer time horizons. For example, as we saw in Chapter 7, Warner and Pleeter’s (2001) study of financial choices by US military personnel shows those preferences for lump sum payments over annuities reflect present bias. Warner and Pleeter also find that different choices correlate with individual differences in age, education and military rank.
Behavioural life-cycle models
A more analytically rigorous way to explore these consumption and savings behaviours have been developed in behavioural business-cycle models of Angeletos et al.  (2011) and 
Laibson et al. (2007). Some of these insights connect to other themes from behavioural 
economics that we have already explored – for example, the issue of instability in time preference, which we explored in Chapter 7 . Saving is by its nature a forward-looking 
process and so people’s attitudes towards the future, specifically their time preferences, have a crucial impact on their savings decisions. As also explored in Chapter 7 , behavioural 
economics postulates that people use hyperbolic or quasi-hyperbolic discount functions in making judgements about the present value of future rewards.
Embellishing the DSGE models with some insights about behavioural economics, An -
geletos et al. (2001) and Laibson et al.  (2007) use behavioural discount functions to con -
struct macroeconomic simulations, similar in empirical style to DSGE models including calibrated, real business-cycle models. Whilst these analyses suffer from similar limita -
tions to standard calibrated models, for example in terms of objective, reliable methods for identifying the parameters used to calibrate the model, they do match real-world patterns of consumption and savings and can help to explain why people accumulate credit card debt at high interest rates whilst simultaneously holding assets that earn low interest rates. Behavioural life-cycle models replace standard economic assumptions about exponential discounting with an assumption of “hyperbolic” or “quasi-hyperbolic” 
 di
scounting – as 
explored in Chapter 6 (see also Frederick et al.  2002; Angeletos et al.  2001; Laibson 1997; 
Thaler and Shefrin 1981). Angeletos et al.  (2001) construct behavioural life-cycle models 
based on quasi-hyperbolic discounting capturing the fact that people hold onto large stores of illiquid wealth (often in the form of housing) whilst simultaneously running up large credit card debts at punitive interest rates.
Another aspect of consumption and savings which is addressed more effectively in 
behavioural macroeconomic models than in standard models is consumer sentiment, building on seminal insights from George Katona who pioneered macroeconomic con -
sumer sentiment surveys in the US – now the US Consumer Sentiment survey hosted by the University of Michigan. 265 a B EH aVIoUr al anal YSI S oF MaCr oECono MI C IntEraCtIonS
Consumer sentiment, and its implications for the macroeconomy, has been analysed 
in a number of ways (Ludvigson 2004). In a macroeconomic context, consumer senti -
ment is significantly affected by non-economic variables (Earl 2005; Katona 1951). Where 
consumer confidence is a function merely of conventional economic indicators, it can be modelled without any recourse to psychology but aspects of “the news” draw on emo -
tions such as fear, anxiety and home and can make people nervous or euphoric, produc -
ing shifts in aggregate demand which are not generated directly by economic variables (Katona 1951). In this way, the psychological side of expectation formation operates as an “intervening variable”.
This proposition is especially significant in affluent societies, particularly when there 
is widespread access to credit. When income and/or loans are available to spend on lux -
uries, macroeconomic forces will affect the timing of consumer durable purchases and adoption of new products (Smith 1975). When consumption is also affected by Veblen effects (conspicuous consumption of high-priced goods) interacting with demonstration effects (for example, people observing others’ consumption when deciding what to con -
sume themselves), macroeconomic consumption has a different nature to microeconomic consumption and so a macroeconomic analysis needs to do more than aggregate the con -
sumption and savings decisions of one representative household.
labour markets and unemployment
In standard economic models, labour markets are described in terms of interactions between profit-maximizing firms buying labour/selling goods and utility-maximizing households selling labour/buying goods. The explanatory power of these approaches is limited though introducing asymmetric information into analyses does increase the ex -
ternal consistency of macroeconomic labour market models. Behavioural economists in -
troduce a range of psychological phenomena into the analysis, focusing in particular on the role of social preferences including trust, reciprocity and fairness. Akerlof and Shiller (2009) apply their animal spirits to labour markets. Most markets trade goods which are inanimate and emotionless but labour markets function differently.
Workers can adapt and change with repercussions for work effort. Psychological and 
sociological factors play a key role. Workers want fair wages (Akerlof and Yellen 1990), they resent their employers if their take-home wage falls, even if the fall in nominal wage is balanced by falling prices. Whilst this behaviour is attributed to money illusion in standard economics, Keynes (1936) explains it in terms of workers wanting to pre -
serve their wages relative to other groups’ wages (see also Shafir et al. 1997 for a survey 
of psychological explanations for money illusion). Similarly, workers reciprocate good treatment by trusting their employers. When wages fall, this sparks anger and resent -
ment; workers’ morale and sense of duty are offended. Work effort will decline and even as wage costs fall, employers’ profit will fall too because worker productivity is eroded.
Heuristics, bias and wages
In Part III  we introduced status quo bias – bias that occurs when people focus on the current 
situation as a reference point and adjust their beliefs and expectations around this refer -
ence point, meaning that they are slow to change their mind. This has implications in the macroeconom y via the labour market. Kahneman et al.  (1996) also study status quo bias in 266 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
the context of money illusion in wage adjustment. Subjects were asked to consider a scenario 
in which a company is making a small profit. Subjects are asked to consider two options:
A: Given no inflation, a company manager decides to decrease wages and salaries by  7%.
B: With inflation at 12%, a company manager decides to increase salaries by only 5%.
More subjects (78%) thought that Option B was acceptable whereas only 37% thought 
that Option A was acceptable. This is a classic nominal wage resistance result seen in 
 ma
croeconomics – used by some economists as an example of money illusion but ex -
plained by Keynes (1936) as reflecting the fact that workers are worried about their rela -
tive not absolute positions. In terms of real wages, everyone suffers equally from inflation but nominal wage falls may affect one group disproportionately relative to others.
Unemployment and efficiency wages
One standard explanation for unemployment is efficiency wages. Hiring workers involves a range of costs including costs involved in the process of hiring, firing and training workers as well as other payroll costs. All this means that the cost of a worker is not just the wage that they are paid. So, a profit-maximizing firm, by raising wages, can increase profits by raising labour productivity and/or lowering other labour costs and the efficient wage is the wage that minimizes unit labour costs, that is, total labour costs per unit of output. Efficiency wages involve paying workers a wage in excess of their marginal pro -
ductivity and this means that the standard labour demand/labour supply relationships will break down. Labour markets will not clear and involuntary unemployment emerges: workers are willing and able to work at the prevailing real wage but can’t find a job.
Some efficiency wage models develop a standard approach by focusing on the im -
pact of asymmetric information on hiring and search and analysing the consequences in terms of involuntary unemployment. Firms pay workers a relatively high wage to prevent shirking by making other opportunities seem relatively less attractive , but paying workers 
a wage above their marginal productivity leads to excess labour supply and involuntary unemployment. It is this involuntary unemployment (rather than the high wage) which disciplines workers in reducing their propensity to shirk because with high levels of in -
voluntary unemployment workers will worry that they won’t find a new job if they are fired for shirking (Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984). Other asymmetric information models focus on the role of high wages in overcoming problems of adverse selection; for example, if higher-productivity workers self-select into more highly paid jobs.
Behavioural models of efficiency wages move beyond the problem of asymmetric 
information analyses to focus on the deeper socio-psychological motivations underlying employer attitudes and worker effort. Akerlof (2002) identifies three psychological and sociological aspects to efficiency wages: reciprocity, fairness and social norms. Akerlof and Yellen (1990) develop some of the themes of fairness and inequity aversion in behav -
ioural economics, as outlined in Chapter 5, in a sociological model of the labour market, based on an effort-fair wage hypothesis . Effort is proportional to the wage paid less sub -
jective perceptions of the fair  wage – which is determined by the average wage and reflects 
wages to high- and low-paid workers alike. If the wage paid is relatively low, effort will be disproportionately lower and this explains why unemployment is higher for low-paid groups. 267 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI C PolIC Y
Reciprocity also plays a role in the labour market. Reciprocity is a feature of gift ex -
change models developed from anthropology. Workers will reciprocate the “gift” of a 
higher wage by working harder. Higher wages encourage effort and also loyalty and with loyal staff, a firm can reduce its labour turnover costs. Fehr et al.  (1993) analyse gift ex -
change games using experimental methods to show that players in experimental markets will offer prices about market clearing levels. They interpret this as evidence in favour of fair wage theories of effort (Fehr et al.  1993). Other experimental evidence shows that 
workers will not play the dominant strategy of minimal effort.
Behavioural macroeconomics is a young discipline and has yet to develop a coherent 
structure. As more insights are developed within microeconomic analyses of behaviour, these may be constructed convincingly into a theory of behavioural macroeconomics but how effectively to address problems of aggregation remains a problem.
In terms of robust analytical approaches, it is unlikely that mathematical methods 
can be employed to give behavioural macroeconomic models with analytical solutions. The use of calibration, simulation and agent-based modelling (ABM) could be extended to capture the complexities of macroeconomic interactions but calibrating these models with appropriate parameter estimates remains a problem, and the subjectivity involved means that, even with these technically sophisticated methods, there will be an element of ad hockery.
One potential solution might be to build a model which separates out the various actors 
within the macroeconomy – identifying specific traits and constraints affecting that group, and bring the actors together using agent-based modelling ( ABM). An ABM approach could 
draw on some robust findings from the analysis of economic behaviour and psychology at a micro scale. Different actors in the economy could be described differently either reflect -
ing their socio-economic context, their roles and/or their basic traits and other individual differences. Another approach would be just to treat the macroeconomy as an organism in itself and focus on the phenomena that emerge without trying to unravel the behavioural microfoundations. Either way, some attention does need to shift towards moving the many useful behavioural insights from the microeconomy to the macroeconomy, and a lot more work needs to be done in finding ways to blend intuitive understandings of how macroe -
conomies operate with empirical techniques in order to guide policy-making.
Behavioural macroeconomic policy
In current debates, behavioural public policy is generally assumed to refer to microe -
conomic policies – designed to change the behaviour of consumers and firms. Whilst it is much neglected, it is also important to apply some of the lessons from behavioural economics to macroeconomic policy-making. In Chapter 10, we explored some of the ways in which behavioural insights can be applied to the design of public policy-
 
ma
king –  sp
ecifically in the form of “nudges”, as popularized in Richard Thaler and Cass 
Sunstein’s 2008 book Nudge . But whilst some of the insights have been applied to microe -
conomic decisions with macro implications, mainly they are designed for microeconomic 
 de
cision-making for households, consumers and individual businesses.
Nudges used in a micro context can have some impact in a macro context, in reduc -
ing financial pressures that might be magnified across an economy. In a computerized world, people may procrastinate in protecting themselves from exploitation and fraud, for 268 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
example they may procrastinate about setting up proper protections when using the In -
ternet for financial transactions. In terms of saving for the future, a person may have good 
intentions but, in the short term, are unable to resist immediately available alternatives , 
reflecting problems of temptation and procrastination. The problem will be magnified when present bias reacts with other forms of bias, particularly overoptimism, leading people to be tempted into financial choices that are too good to be true, such as payday loans. The problem is that these microeconomic interventions are unlikely to be enough, especially in the face of global financial crises and recessions, and a lot is needed to bring clear and robust behavioural insights to macroeconomic policy-making.
Less has been done to explore how behavioural economics can come together with 
macroeconomic policy-making, even though effective macroeconomic policy-making is central to a successful economy and society. There has been a limited focus in behavioural economics on the psychology of policy-makers.
Some policy implications can be derived from contrasting the essentials of behav -
ioural economics with the foundations of the standard DSGE models that we have ex -
plored earlier in this chapter. These DSGE models were developed in response to the ‘New Classical’ economist Robert Lucas’s critique of government policy. Lucas and other New Classical economists argued that discretionary fiscal and monetary policy is ineffective because it is undermined by rational expectations: rational agents anticipate discretionary policies and raise their inflationary expectations and wage demands in anticipation of higher inflation. Behavioural economics undermines this analysis because it provides a fundamental challenge to the rational expectations hypothesis – not necessarily in assert -
ing that people are irrational but in suggesting that people’s rationality takes a form quite different from the mathematically tractable type of rationality seen in orthodox macro -
economic theory. Given systematic behavioural biases, people’s mistakes are unlikely to balance out on average, especially if people are susceptible to herding and social learning.
Akerlof and Shiller’s (2009) analysis is a fundamental challenge to the Lucas critique 
because their focus on the importance of psychological factors in the macroeconomy implies that governments do  have an important role to play in complementing capitalism , 
as we will see below.
Another set of policy implications drawing on insights from behavioural economics 
links to assumptions around time preference, as introduced in Chapter 7  and explored 
in the context of macroeconomic theory earlier in this chapter. Other mainstream mac -
roeconomists, including Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott, and Robert Barro and David Gordon, have developed the Lucas critique in focusing on the macroeconomic problem of dynamic inconsistency. Policies which are optimal in one period will generate en -
dogenous changes in expectations and a new optimal policy will emerge in the next period , which will change expectations again. Then a different optimal policy will be 
appropriate but this will change expectations again, and so on and so on. Overall, any discretionary policy will generate unstable shifts in expectations . The policy implica -
tion is that governments should not intervene. However, these approaches are based on assumptions not only of rational expectations and perfect information but also of exponential discounting. Incorporating behavioural discount functions into macroeco -
nomic models of policy-making may deliver different results and implications, particu -
larly once political considerations are added into the mix. Political business cycles, and perhaps the Euro crisis and financial crisis too, are partly the product of politicians’  269 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI C PolIC Y
present bias. Long-term strategies are undermined by short-term political contingencies 
and impulses in much the same way that a smoker’s plan to give up is undermined by a stressful domestic event. Policy-makers need pre-commitment devices and perhaps central bank independence can be better justified on the basis of behavioural insights about present bias.
More broadly, Akerlof and Shiller (2009) argue that governments play an impor -
tant role in complementing capitalism and “capitalism must live within certain rules” (p. 173). Given the overwhelming influence of animal spirits “the government must set 
those rules” (p. 173). Our old financial system is a Humpty Dumpty – it’s broken, cannot be fixed and must be replaced and, to moderate the current slump, Akerlof and Shiller advocate that governments adopt a two-target approach in which fiscal and monetary stimuli are complemented by targeting financial flows, for example via lending and capi -
tal injections, to ensure that they are consistent with full employment.
To summarize the broad implications of behavioural economics for macroeco -
nomic policy-making: in orthodox macroeconomic analyses – exemplified in the mod -
els of the New Classical economists – rational agents are continuously undermining systematic policy-making. The conclusion from the New Classical economists is that policy-makers should stand back and focus on a hands-off, transparent approach. These diktats have softened as New Keynesian macroeconomic theory – which combines the rational expectations assumptions of New Classical economics with a Keynesian ap -
proach in which unemployment persists and markets don’t clear – came to the fore in the 1980s onwards. Nonetheless, the New Keynesian focus on inflation targeting and central bank independence as essential ingredients to effective monetary policy is still founded on the idea that people are rational maximizers and governments do not need to intervene. Behavioural economics, if it can be effectively embedded within mac -
roeconomic theory, has the potential to transform this approach to policy-making by bringing in a richer and more nuanced understanding of how people’s real decisions affect the macroeconomy. Behavioural economics also brings in new insights about the policy goals that governments should be worrying about – including policies to boost happiness and well-being at a macroeconomic scale – a theme we will explore in more detail in Chapter 18.
~
Overall, behavioural economics has made less progress in macroeconomic analysis than in microeconomic analysis – but this is true of orthodox macroeconomic theory too. Macroeconomies are complicated by interactions and feedbacks between individuals, firms and industries and these are all difficult to capture within one parsimonious model. In addition, testing the different macroeconomic theories against each other is compli -
cated by the difficulties of collecting data to capture how individual decision-making and interactions between people feed through into macroeconomic phenomena. With -
out a strong and robust macroeconomic theory, it is difficult effectively to design robust macroeconomic policies – especially when financial instability is added to the standard macroeconomic policy goals framed around boosting employment and stabilizing infla -
tion. New methodological tools – for example, agent-based modelling and other compu -
tational modelling techniques – are adding new insights. All these gaps and shortcomings 270 BEHaVIoUr al MaCr oECono MI CS
represent an opportunity, however. Of all the areas of behavioural economics and fi -
nance, macroeconomics is perhaps the area which still leaves the most to be explored and 
discovered.
Chapter summary
 •Developing a behavioural macroeconomic theory is limited by aggregation problems and complex interactions between different macroeconomic actors.
 •Behavioural macroeconomics can offer important insights to explain some of the key themes traditionally explored in conventional macroeconomics, structured into decision-making around consumption–savings, employment, unemployment, fixed asset investment and business cycles.
 •Conventions and animal spirits are key influences in many behavioural macroeco -
nomic models – drawing on John Maynard Keynes’s original insights about how conventional decision-making drives financial markets and animal spirits, seen in the form of entrepreneurs’ urge to act and drive fixed asset investment decisions.
 •Akerlof and Shiller have broadened Keynes’s concept of animal spirits to extend to a number of drivers of macroeconomic fluctuations, including the five influences of confidence, fairness, storytelling, money illusion and corruption.
 •In behavioural alternatives to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) the -

ences, and these models often use agent-based modelling techniques to capture these divergences.
 •Behavioural macroeconomic models of consumption–savings draw on key insights about time inconsistency.
 •Behavioural insights for macroeconomic policy-making have been limited and this is one area of behavioural economics that needs much more research and analysis.

Financial instability and macroeconomic 
performance
Financial instability is one of the most pressing problems of our time and is affected by 
a complex nexus of financial, economic and political forces. In the previous chapter we introduced behavioural economics, focusing on the “real side” of the macroeconomy, that is, fixed asset investment, employment, production and output, without saying too much about the financial system. Yet, as the 2007 /8 financial crisis and subsequent global re -
cession illustrated, financial instability can have seismic and systemic impacts on macro -
economic outcomes – affecting jobs and production as well as the profits from financial trading. Without understanding how financial decision-making at a microeconomic level feeds through into the real economy, it is difficult properly to capture all the complexities of macroeconomic phenomena. In this chapter, we apply some of the insights about behav -
ioural finance explored in previous chapters, and use them to explain financial instability on a systemic scale. Then we explore impacts on the macroeconomy, to explain how and why unstable financial systems create problems for the “real side” of the macroeconomy, in 
terms of slowing growth and rising unemployment, and what can be done about it.
Financial market (in)efficiency
From the 1960s onwards, mainstream economic and financial theory highlighted assump -
tions of rational expectations (Muth 1961) and efficient financial markets (Fama 1965). In these models, the actions of homogenous, independent, self-interested individuals are assumed to be coordinated effectively via the “invisible hand” of the price mechanism. Alongside this smoothly functioning price mechanism, financial markets were also work -
ing smoothly because financial speculators are  assumed to use information  efficiently, 
systematically and consistently, forming expectations rationally by avoiding systematic mistakes. New information rather than group behaviour influences changes in asset prices (Fama 1965; Muth 1961) and so, in this perfect world, asset prices equilibrate towards the true fundamental values, where the fundamental value is defined as the discounted stream of expected future returns, for example in the case of a stock/share this is the discounted stream of expected future dividends. Given the liquid, fast-moving nature of financial markets, it was also assumed that speculative noise trading would have no sig -
nificant impact because arbitrage would eliminate it and asset prices would adjust fully to 272 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
reflect all currently available information. Allowing for differences in risk across assets, 
an asset’s price was assumed to be an unbiased indicator of its fundamental value given its risk profile.
If markets are efficient and people are rational then mistakes should cancel out on 
average and asset prices will track fundamental values. But this simple story does not easily match real-world experiences of frequent financial crisis. Financial crises have always been common and are difficult to reconcile with these assumptions of rational expectations and efficient markets. So, from the 1990s onwards, a growing number of economists were working on innovations to financial theory particularly focusing on asymmetric information and principal agent problems. But these models still embedded assumptions about people’s capacity for rational decision-making. Other economists – including 
 Ki
ndleberger, Shiller and Shleifer – were taking a different perspective in pre -
senting a different view of decision-making in financial markets, analysing problems of mob psychology, panics and irrational exuberance to explain the roots of financial crisis, focusing on phenomena such as herding alongside problems of policy mismanagement (Kindleberger and Aliber 2005; Shiller 2000; Shleifer 2000). These endeavours were given extra momentum following the bailout of Northern Rock in 2007, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the ensuing financial crises. Strict assumptions of rational expec -
tations and efficient markets are  unlikely to deepen our understanding of financial crisis 
and analysis shifted to focus on a wider range of explanations for financial crises includ -
ing regulatory failures, leveraging enabled by excessive liquidity, asymmetric information and fundamental uncertainty.
In this context, insights from behavioural finance had a particularly powerful role to 
play in providing a richer explanation in which the psychology of financial speculation, alongside some of the institutional failures in which financial instability was incubated, became an important thing to explain. Behavioural and psychological factors place limits on rational trading, allowing financial instability to spread. Erratic financial market fluc -
tuations can be captured more easily when restrictive behavioural assumptions associated with rational expectations are relaxed at the same time as restrictive assumptions about markets, that is, the efficient markets hypothesis, are relaxed. Behavioural and psycholog -
ical factors place limits on rational trading.
time and instability
One way to explain financial instability is via the problem of time inconsistency – 
 in
troduced in Chapter 7 . Partly this reflects short-termism in household decision-making, 
specifically their savings and consumption decisions. In addition to other forms of bias, financial instability will be exacerbated by present bias and distortions to inter-temporal preferences. In mainstream analysis, short-termism/impatience can be captured by high discount rates but recent developments in behavioural economics and finance have de -
veloped a richer understanding of preference reversals and time inconsistency. Present bias can be captured by replacing the conventional assumption of exponential discount -
ing with an assumption of “hyperbolic” or “quasi-hyperbolic” discounting, as explored in Chapter 7 (see also Frederick et al.  2002; Angeletos et al.  2001; Laibson 1997; Thaler 
and Shefrin 1981). Angeletos et al.  (2001) construct behavioural life-cycle models based 
on quasi-hyperbolic discounting capturing the fact that people hold onto large stores of  273 SPECU lat IV E B UBB lES
illiquid wealth (often in the form of housing) whilst simultaneously running up large 
credit card debts at punitive interest rates.
In explaining financial instability at an aggregate level, a key point is that the conse -
quences of short-termism are not confined to householders and will have consequences for financial stability more generally. With speculative bubbles, financial traders’ deci -
sions are disproportionately focused on short-term outcomes: the long-term value of an asset is unimportant if you intend to sell the asset quickly (Keynes 1936, p. 156). If time horizons are short, discount rates are high and financial markets are very liquid, then speculative bubbles mean that the social costs of liquid financial markets may be dispro -
portionately high relative to the benefits in terms of providing quick and easy forms of financing for business investment and consumption. Short-termism, time inconsistency and cognitive bias may limit people’s ability to make judicious financial decisions and if macroeconomic factors further undermine their ability to service their debts, either because they lose their jobs and/or they have take on unsustainable forms of debt such as payday loans, then this will exacerbate and prolong household financial problems making default more likely. As householders default, the contagion spreads to their lenders and financial institutions more widely, with negative impacts for the financial system and macroeconomy, as was seen in the fallout to the subprime crisis in the US and also in housing bubbles bursting in other OECD countries during the credit crunch of 2007/8 onwards.
Speculative bubbles
One of the key features of an unstable financial system is its susceptibility to speculative bubbles. But what precisely is a speculative bubble? Speculative bubbles are, by definition, violations of the efficient markets hypothesis because they are about persistent deviations in asset prices away from assets’ fundamental long-term value – where the fundamental value is defined as the present value of the discounted stream of expected future returns on that asset. The fundamental value of a share, for example, will be what shareholders expect that share to deliver as dividends (essentially the shareholder’s chunk of a firm’s net profits), measured in terms of the present value of dividends, if they were to hold the share forever. A speculative bubble in a share occurs when the share’s price rises much beyond what the shareholder could expect that share to earn in the future.
Speculative bubbles are an essential feature of financial instability. If markets are effi -
cient and people are rational then mistakes should cancel out on average and asset prices will track fundamental values. When they do not, speculative bubbles emerge and insights from behavioural finance can help to explain how and why speculation emerges and spreads to create financial instability.
Tulipmania was one of the most famous speculative bubbles, as well as one of the 
more colourful episodes in financial history. For three to four short months from No -
vember 1636, demand for tulip bulbs in Holland spiralled out of control and tulip bulb prices exploded; price rises of up to 6,000% were recorded for the rarer tulip bulbs. At the height of tulipmania, a single bulb from the exotic Semper Augustus tulip cost as much as a three-storey house in central Amsterdam (Baddeley and McCombie 2004; Baddeley 2018). Speculative bust followed the speculative frenzy in a way which was just as dra -
matic. By February 1637, most bulbs became impossible to sell at any price and many tulip  274 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
speculators lost their fortunes. There are many more recent examples of speculative bub -
bles, for example the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s, the South Sea Bubble and the 
global/regional financial crises that predominant today. These, and many other specula -
tive episodes throughout history, have undermined standard financial theories grounded on assumptions of rational expectations and efficient financial markets. Whilst there are models of rational speculative bubbles, these cannot fully explain systematic trends in financial markets. Behavioural finance helps to fill the gap.
animal spirits in financial markets
A powerful explanation for speculative bubbles and unstable financial markets is the influ -
ence of animal spirits. In the last chapter, we explored Keynes’s concept of animal spirits in the context of real activity in the macroeconomy, where the real side is about physical, non-financial/monetary outputs and output. Some of these insights can be applied to the financial side too. Originally, Keynes analysed animal spirits just in the context of entre -
preneurship arguing that uncertainty about the future prevents entrepreneurs from prop -
erly calculating the future benefits of their business decisions. In the absence of a basis for rational calculation, entrepreneurs’ decisions will be propelled by spontaneous urges to act and to do something positive (Keynes 1936, 1937).
Keynes did not apply the animal spirits concept to financial markets. As explained in 
Chapter 16, Akerlof and Shiller take the concept of animal spirits from Keynes but define it more broadly. Their animal spirits include confidence, fairness, corruption, money il -
lusion and storytelling. Also, whilst Keynes focused his analysis on the animal spirits of entrepreneurs engaged in fixed asset investment, Akerlof and Shiller extend the definition of animal spirits to include a broad range of psychological influences. In the context of financial instability, they also explore the influence of animal spirits from entrepreneurs to all economic agents, including financial speculators.
Another way in which Akerlof and Shiller’s analysis of animal spirits differs from 
Keynes is that they applied their analysis of animal spirits to financial systems too, arguing that they have profound impacts on financial instability. Akerlof and Shiller analyse emo -
tional factors in this context, in contrast to the conventional approaches which we out -
lined above, which assume rational expectations and efficient processing of information in financial markets. Akerlof and Shiller observe that pretending that asset prices reflect rational expectations of future payoffs is like “hiring a weather forecaster who has gone berserk” (Akerlof and Shiller 2009, p. 132). In the place of standard assumptions of ration -
ality and efficient markets, Akerlof and Shiller argue that financial instability is driven by forces of spontaneous optimism and pessimism in financial markets.
All Akerlof and Shiller’s animal spirits have the potential to play a role in magnifying 
financial instability. If confidence is high and people are optimistic, then financial sys -
tems and the macroeconomy more generally will be vulnerable to emotions of eupho -
ria, optimism and overconfidence precipitating herding and speculative bubbles. When confidence is weak and people are pessimistic, then the macroeconomy will be prone to slumps and financial crises. Asset prices will be susceptible to feedback loops, with insta -
bility further magnified by leverage. The real economy will be affected too as herding and speculative bubbles exacerbate instability, depressing wealth, the availability of finance, investment, employment and consumption. 275 Moo DS a n D W EatHEr
Animal spirits associated with corruption are a particularly strong theme in Akerlof 
and Shiller’s analysis of financial instability. Akerlof and Shiller suggest that financial in -
stability is associated with the erosion of social preferences around trust, trustworthiness 
and reciprocity, the dampening of cooperative social norms and other aspects of sociality. Corruption grows during boom times, perhaps when evidence of inequality is less avail -
able and salient, but it also creates fragility within the financial system and exposures of fraudulent activity can exacerbate financial downturns. Throughout history, corruption has accompanied the business cycle – from the Prohibition and the Great Depression of 
the 1930s, to the Savings and Loan crisis associated with the 1991 recession, to the Enron scandal associated with the 2001 recession and to the subprime mortgage crisis which precipitated recent  recession s around the world (Akerlof and Shiller 2009).
Some of the other animal spirits identified by Akerlof and Shiller also have the po -
tential to play a role in magnifying financial instability, and their different animal spirits interact with each other. If confidence is high and people are optimistic, then financial systems and the macroeconomy more generally will be vulnerable to emotions of eupho -
ria, optimism and overconfidence precipitating herding and speculative bubbles. When confidence is weak and people are pessimistic, then the macroeconomy will be prone to slumps and financial crises. Asset prices will be susceptible to feedback loops, with instability further magnified by leverage. The real economy will be affected too as herd -
ing and speculation exacerbate instability and depress wealth, the availability of finance, investment, employment and consumption.
Moods and weather
Related to animal spirits are the psychological influences reflecting mood, which is a more diffuse influence than emotions which tend to be person- and context-specific. We saw in Chapter 15  that emotions will affect financial decision-making and will contribute 
to volatility if they weaken the link between asset prices and the fundamental value, that is, the “real” value of assets, and thereby increase susceptibility to bullish asset bubbles and bearish busts. Feedback effects can intensify fear responses to evaluations of risk, pre-cipitating panics. Emotional factors such as nervousness or euphoria can induce shifts in aggregate demand in a way that cannot be explained just using economic analysis (Katona 1951). When all this comes together across groups of traders and speculators, then this can have significant impacts on financial markets as a whole.
One way to capture the influences of mood on financial markets is to unravel some 
of the drivers of mood – specifically weather. One section of behavioural finance focuses on exploring how financial markets are affected by exogenous weather-induced changes in mood and the knock-on effect of mood in financial markets. The impact of moods on markets has been explored by analysing moods in financial markets.
Kamstra et al. (2003) analyse links between depressive moods, risk aversion and fi -
nancial market activity focusing on the analysis of data on seasonal depression – what is known as “seasonal affective disorder” (SAD) – a depressive state linked to the fewer hours of sunlight experienced during winter seasons. Kamstra et al.  hypothesize that SAD 
is associated with increased risk aversion. They adopt the insight from prospect theory that people respond more to changes than to levels and hypothesize that changes in risk aversion prompted by the changing seasons will translate into changes in stock market 276 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
returns. Returns will be lower in the fall as hours of sunlight decline and higher in the 
winter when days are starting to get longer again. Kamstra et al.  estimate stock market 
returns for markets at different latitudes using lagged returns, an autumn/fall dummy variable, a SAD measure capturing hours of darkness, plus a range of weather variables (e.g. cloud cover, precipitation, temperature) as explanatory variables. They find that their SAD variable has a strongly significant impact on stock market returns and attribute this pattern to the impact of seasonal depression on risk aversion.
Similarly, Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) have analysed the relationships between 
mood, sunlight and financial trading activity, making a general prediction that hours of sunlight are associated with a positive mood. They analyse weather data, specifically hours of sunshine and its impact on stock market returns between 1982 and 1989 for 26 international stock exchanges. Similarl to Kamstra et al. , they find that daily stock returns 
correlate positively with hours of sunshine but other aspects of the weather, for example snow and rain, do not correlate with stock market returns. They suggest that weather de -
rivatives could be devised to exploit this weather-related pattern of returns.
Financial herding
In the context of financial instability, in a world of fundamental Knightian uncertainty, emotional factors will interact with socio-economic forces increasing the susceptibility of financial markets to fluctuations in optimism and pessimism. Financial herding is a key channel for some of these social forces, and a strong driver of speculative bubbles. Finan -
cial herding is about the inclination of traders and speculators to copy each other – and financial herding models build on some of the drivers of individuals herding – as intro -
duced in Chapters 6 and 15. At an aggregate level, herding in financial markets generates speculative bubbles because traders are responding to what their predecessors have done. For example, if a share trader sees another trader paying a high price for a share then they will pay a high price too, and so the share price builds momentum and spirals up and beyond the fundamental value of the share. More generally, as asset traders follow along behind each other, this creates momentum sending financial asset prices up and up, until the bubble because too big to last, and it bursts. But what explains the tendency for groups of traders to group together and drive instability in this way?
Herding is endemic within financial markets, especially during uncertain times. 
In standard financial theory, new information rather than group behaviour influences changes in asset prices (Fama 1965; Muth 1961). This problem is particularly stark when information is poor and uncertainty is endemic, leading to asset bubbles/trending in asset prices because traders and speculators have little objective information on which to base their decisions. When these socially-driven behaviours come together across a financial market, this is a key driver of speculative bubbles on a wider scale and this financial insta -
bility tips over into the macroeconomy more generally.
This herding behaviour can also reflect present bias if speculative decisions are dispro -
portionately focused on short-term outcomes: the long-term value of an asset is unimpor -
tant if you intend to sell the asset quickly (Keynes 1936, p. 156). This insight is important because it suggests that if time horizons are short, discount rates are high and financial markets are very liquid then the speculative bubbles generate negative herding external -
ities, in which case the social costs of liquid financial markets may be disproportionately  277 FInan CIal  H ErDIng
high. Returning to the efficient markets hypothesis, herding will stop financial markets 
efficiently processing information when a financial market is dominated by traders who are worrying what others think, and not worrying about the fundamental, long-term value of assets. This will mean that changes in asset prices will become random – in other words, financial asset prices will follow random walks.
Some of the explanations for herding in financial markets have their roots in Keynes’s 
analysis of speculation. Keynes focused on the relationships between psychological forces and instability including psychological waves of optimism and pessimism that affect fi -
nancial markets  and the social conventions that anchor speculators’ expectations. Keynes 
analysed speculators responding to sociological forces. When uncertainty prevents spec -
ulators from using information to form their own clear judgements, conventions will take hold and will encourage speculators to believe what others believe and to do what others  do.
Keynes (1936, 1937) pioneered the study of social influences in financial markets 
perhaps partly a reflection of his financial trading expertise. He blended econom -
ics, psychology and finance, explaining financial instability as the outcome of socio-
 
ps
ychological forces, Keynes explained speculation and financial instability as the product 
of  so
cially-propelled conventions which anchor speculators’ expectations and generate 
psychological waves of optimism and pessimism – thus driving financial market fluctua -
tions. When uncertainty prevents speculators from using information to form their own clear judgements, conventions will take hold and will encourage speculators to believe what others believe and to do what others do.
Financial instability is magnified by a range of social interactions between financial 
speculators, both amateur and professional. When a financial market is characterized by traders copying each other, then what Keynes calls a conventional valuation will dom -
inate. The market will be driven not by fundamental values but by social conventions. Rational economic agents may have an incentive to follow the crowd and herding will result as a response to individuals’ perceptions of their own ignorance. Keynes focused on three main reasons for financial markets to be dominated by conventional valuations and herding: social learning, beauty contests and reputation. These insights endure today in modern theoretical analyses of information cascades (introduced in Chapter 6 ), beauty 
contest models of iterative thinking (introduced in Chapter 5) and reputation models.
Social learning
Social learning is about traders using information they gather from observing the actions of other traders. If they see lots of other traders prepared to pay a high price for an asset then they will pay a high price themselves – because they assume that other traders know what they are doing. This herding will be rational if an individual has reason to believe that other agents’ judgements are based upon better information than their own: other people’s judgements become a data set in themselves. In this way, people will incorporate others’ opinions into their prior information set and their posterior judgements may ex -
hibit herding tendencies.
As explained in Chapter 6 , Bayesian models explain herding in the form of informa -
tion cascades as a process of sequential learning on a microeconomic scale with people updating probabilities sequentially as the decisions of other individuals are revealed. On a macroeconomic scale, financial herding cannot easily be explained as the outcome of a 278 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
sequential Bayesian process and is a more general phenomenon occurring when people 
respond to social influences by following the group or herd. This will necessarily gener -
ate a violation of strict forms of the efficient markets hypothesis because this hypothesis precludes the systematic trends generated by herding in assuming that all changes are unpredictable and asset prices follow random walks.
Keynes (1930, 1936, 1937) described herding in financial markets as a response to 
uncertainty and individuals’ perceptions of their own ignorance. Herding will be the out -
come of social learning when people follow the crowd because they think that the rest of the crowd is better informed. In this way, market fluctuations are driven by conventional beliefs rather than fundamental values. Instability emerges because herding affects the general state of business confidence and also generates self-fulfilling prophecies and spec -
ulative episodes. Keynes argues that during financial speculation, people will purchase an asset at a seemingly exorbitant price not because they independently believe that the object is worth the cost but because they believe that other people think that it is.
reputation
Protecting reputations is another social driver of financial herding and financial market instability. If a trader takes risks and performs poorly then they will be less likely to lose their job and/or bonus if other traders have been taking the same risks. There is job se -
curity in numbers. Keynes postulated that it is rational to follow the crowd and herd if it helps you to maintain a good reputation, observing that it is better to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally (Keynes 1936, pp. 157–158).
Reputation is not about learning from others; it has a broader interpretation. Keynes 
observed that following others may help individuals to maintain good reputations; it makes sense to follow the crowd because there is safety in numbers.
Scharfstein and Stein (1990) incorporate this insight about social influence into their 
analysis of herding in fund managers’ decisions. Fund managers have to convince people that they are investing wisely and, as short-term performance is not a good indicator of skill, they rely for their reputations on comparisons with peers, building upon Keynes’s (1936) insight that it is better to be conventionally wrong than unconventionally right. This will provide incentives to follow others and disregard private information in order to build their reputations. Managers will have an incentive to disregard private information in a world in which reputation matters.
Beauty contests
A third driver of financial herding, according to Keynes, is beauty contests. A financial market trader may spend time second-guessing other traders in a market. If a trader be -
lieves that others will buy (or sell) then they will buy (or sell) too because the increases in demand will lead to rising prices, from which you will benefit. This phenomenon is captured in what Keynes (1936) first described as a beauty contest . Keynes originally de -
scribed beauty contests in terms of a newspaper competition: competitors are asked to se -
lect from a series of photos not who they think is prettiest but who they think others will think is prettiest, or who they think others will think others will think is prettiest. It is a metaphor for the iterated reasoning that characterizes financial speculation. Speculators  279 FInan CIal  H ErDIng
are not worrying about what they think an asset is worth; they are more interested in 
tracking short-term judgements of others and so are more focused on average opinions of average  opinion.
The beauty contest competition has its parallels in financial markets. Given the fast, 
liquid nature of financial markets, speculators have no reason to worry about the long-term fundamental value of an asset because they intend to sell it quickly. To make money out of speculation in highly liquid and fast-moving markets, it is important to judge what the crowd is thinking and to follow it when you think that market valuations of assets are going to increase in value, even though you may privately think that they are overpriced. So, people buy assets at seemingly exorbitant prices not because they independently be -
lieved that the asset is fundamentally worth its price but because they believe that they can sell it to someone else for an even higher price. This helps to explain why, through -
out history, people have frequently been observed buying seemingly overpriced assets, whether tulip bulbs during tulipmania, houses during housing booms, or dotcom shares during Internet bubbles.
Beauty contests have been used in microeconomic models of learning to capture the 
links between imitation and iterative thinking, for example see Camerer and Weigelt (1991); Ho et al . (1998); Bhatt and Camerer (2005) and Camerer (1997, 2003a). Similar 
models of imitation explain irrational imitative behaviour as an outcome of the expec -
tation that others  will behave irrationally (Porter and Smith 1995). With beauty contests, 
financial instability will increase because asset prices will be susceptible to feedback loops and, if borrowings are used to fund asset purchases, instability will be magnified by lev -
erage , i.e. borrowings . Leveraging can have a destabilizing impact even on experienced 
traders. Porter and Smith (2008) devise experiments that incorporate increases in liquid -
ity and dividend uncertainty as shocks to the environments of experienced subjects. By introducing credit into asset markets in this way, experienced subjects can be repeatedly jolted away from equilibrium rekindling and sustaining speculative bubbles.
Beauty contests can also be linked to payoff externalities and reflexivity. When a 
person buys an asset, this contributes to rising demand and increasing prices and these generate payoff externalities for all holders of the asset, including the buyer. Reflexivity describes a related phenomenon characterizing systems affected by feedback loops and simultaneity. Cause and effect cannot be separated and markets will be prone to endoge -
nously determined market fluctuations. Soros (1987) applies the concept of reflexivity to financial markets; in financial systems, reflexivity is manifested in speculative episodes in which rises in asset prices lead to further rises. When financial traders herd behind others, trends will develop propagating mistakes through financial markets and changing individuals’ perceptions of market fundamentals. Mistakes will not be random but instead will feed on themselves generating self-fulfilling prophecies. When speculators follow trends, these biases will spread, for example share prices fall because speculators believe they will fall and so they do fall.
Macroeconomic impacts
Financial herding has significant negative impacts for financial markets as a whole. Whilst herding means that conventional beliefs will hold sway for sustained periods of time, dur -
ing episodes of extreme uncertainty financial markets will become very fragile. Investors 280 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
and speculators will respond in a volatile way to ephemeral changes in information be -
cause decisions and choices do not have a substantive basis (Keynes 1936, pp. 153–154). 
This generates social costs: whilst it may be rational for individuals to copy others, if copying and herding spreads through large groups of people then volatile speculative ep -
isodes will become more likely. Given uncertainty, if people are learning about financial assets from looking at others’ trades then herding may be the outcome of a rational learn -
ing but it may also be irrational if it is propelled by blind convention and unreasoning speculative frenzies.
Social mood in socionomics
A novel approach to analysing links between unstable financial markets and macroeco -
nomic impacts brings together insights about financial herding with the analyses of weather and mood . Socionomics, an approach to financial analysis pioneered by Robert Prechter 
from the Socionomics Institute in Gainesville, Georgia. Prechter and Parker (2007) identi -
fies social mood as the ultimate independent variable, affecting trends in all markets, from  
financial markets  to the macroeconomy, which builds on insights about mood and emotion 
in decision-making more generally. In socionomic analysis, mood is the ultimate causal factor and is experienced collectively in the form of “social mood”.
Socionomic analysis is developed by Prechter (2002) and Prechter and Parker (2007) 
from Elliott’s wave principle, which focused on deterministic cyclical fluctuations (see also Prechter 201 6). Insights have been applied specifically to financial and macroeco -
nomic  fluctuations by Prechter and Parker (2007). Casti (2010) surveys the socionomic 
literature and outlines some of the key facets of socionomic analysis. The central hypoth -
esis focuses on interactions between individuals. Social networks and herding link to a collective “social mood” which has impacts on events depending on the “mood polarity”. A negative, pessimistic mood polarity will lead to financial instability, conservatism in fashion and consumer purchases and insularity in government policy leading govern -
ments to favour policies such as protectionism. With a positive social mood polarity, people will be optimistic and hopeful. Fashions will reflect the positive mood – hemlines will go up and politicians will do well. As support, Casti notes that 911 had a minimal impact because overall the social mood was positive. Attributing causality to these events is complex but Casti rules out feedback effects between events and social mood. Mass psychology determines events but no event can feed back into social mood because mood is the ultimate independent variable.
Minsky’s financial fragility hypothesis
Socionomics is not specifically an economic theory, but it links to key insights from be -
havioural macroeconomics . Shiller (2000, 2003) analyses these ideas in the context of 
feedback theories of endogenous opinion formation in which beliefs about the system determine the path of that system, for example as is seen in stock markets (see also Topol 1991, Shleifer 2000, Brunnermeier 2001 and Sornette 2003, amongst others). As we saw from the analysis of financial herding models, outlined above, socio-economic forces af -
fect traders, for example via the socially-propelled conventions that, in times of uncer -
tainty, encourage speculators to believe what others believe and to do what others do  281 MInSkY’S F In anCIal  Frag IlItY H YPotHE SIS
(Keynes 1930, 1936, 1937). Following this approach other economists, most famously 
Hyman Minsky, analyse emotional contagion identifying the speculative euphoria that spreads through groups of investors during manic phases as a crucial catalyst in economic and financial booms. In turn, excessive pessimism and extreme risk aversion precipitate bust phases (Minksy 1978, 1986).
What does all this have to do with the macroeconomy more generally? Following in 
Keynes’s footsteps . Minsky (1975) and Kindleberger and Aliber (2005) and Shiller (1995, 
2000) have analysed how the socio-
 ps
ychological impacts of financial instability have 
wider impacts as emotional contagion generates financial fragility. Key insights around these themes come from Hyman 
 Mi
nsky – a 20th-century economist whose financial fra -
gility hypothesis  received renewed attention in the aftermath of the 2007 /8 financial crises.
Minsky analysed the speculative euphoria which spreads through groups of investors 
during booms, generating manic phases as a crucial catalyst in economic and financial booms; in turn, excessive pessimism and extreme risk aversion precipitate bust phases. These socio-psychological influences have traction when finance is structured in particu -
lar ways. In Minsky’s analysis, financial structure is composed of three main elements: hedge finance, speculative finance and Ponzi finance units. Hedge finance units fund in -
vestment projects that are sustainable in the long term because both interest payments on debt and repayments of the principal sums borrowed will be recouped via earnings from the assets funded by hedge finance. Speculative finance units are sustainable in the short term: profits accruing from the asset funded by the speculative finance units will be enough to repay the interest accumulating on debt. Ponzi units, however, create signif -
icant financial fragility and are unsustainable both in the short term and the long term , 
and are justifiable only by assuming future bonanzas. The profits from the asset funded by the Ponzi units are not enough even to cover the interest accumulating on debt, let alone repay the principal.
Given this financial structure, Minsky explores how financial instability is generated 
from an interplay between financial fragility created, as described above, and the opera -
tion of socio-psychological influences and emotional trading, as explored in Chapter 15. Waves of optimism and pessimism drive these financial and investment decisions. These fluctuations in sentiment help to explain how the business cycle is driven by financial fluctuations and financial fragility.
At the beginning of the business cycle, a euphoric boom phase starts to build up. Ex -
cessive optimism leads entrepreneurs to borrow too much to fund their fixed asset invest -
ment projects. Banks and other lenders are keen to lend, and in a euphoric boom phase lend too much. Eventually, the overinvestment becomes unsustainable and banks start to realize it and so add risk premia onto interest rates, and so interest rates on debt start in -
creasing . This generates what Minsky terms present value reversals : projects with a positive net 
present value (the discounted stream of expected future profits minus initial investment costs) at low interest rates transform into projects with a net present value at high interest rates. This means that some hedge finance units are transformed into speculative finance units: the profits from the asset that the finance units are funding is no longer sufficient to cover the principal repayments. Similarly, some speculative finance units are transformed into Ponzi units: the profits are no longer sufficient even to cover the interest repayments. Then some Ponzi units go into default: the profits are no longer sufficient to cover either interest repayments or repayment of principal.282 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
What has all this got to do with the real economy? As entrepreneurs go into default, 
this is when financial fragility creates problems for the real-side – overoptimism is re-
placed with excessive pessimism. Bank lending dries up, fixed asset investment slows down, employment and production go into reverse. In this way, the financial fragility set up by the structure of financing as outlined above, generates real-side consequences, leading to recession. Socio-psychological influences interact with the structure of fi -
nance to set up an unsustainable financial structure – essentially because of emotional 
 ov
erreactions – and the consequences tip over into the real economy.
Controlling financial instability
Minsky’s financial fragility hypothesis suggests some acute challenges facing policy-  
ma
kers trying to control financial instability and this partly, though not entirely, explains 
perennial problems of financial policy mismanagement (Kindleberger and Aliber 2005; Shiller 2000; Shleifer 2000). This raises the question: what can be done about this finan -
cial instability – in terms of institutional solutions and also solutions that might redress some of the socio-psychological, emotional and behavioural factors?
A greater understanding of how psychological traits affect economic and financial 
 de
cision-making will inform policies designed to control financial risk-taking at a micro -
economic level. Excessive risk-taking can be controlled if firms can construct incentives to encourage traders to take a more long-term view. Rogue trading can be reduced if people work within teams and traders have to report to a manager who takes a longer-term view. Other policy suggestions have included hiring more women or older men because they have lower testosterone levels and are less inclined to take risks (Coates et al. 2010). Technical in -
novations have also been devised including the emotional-sensing “Rationalizer” system – a machine promoted by Royal General Electric and ABN-Amro and designed to provide an “emotional mirror” by monitoring online traders’ galvanic skin response, a measure of skin conductance reflecting sweat rates, producing alerts when a trader is overexcited.
It is not clear how feasible these microeconomic solutions might be, particularly as 
it would be difficult to enforce their adoption by private firms. Designing effective mac -
roeconomic policies is crucial, especially as financial instability can be a socially-driven, aggregate phenomenon. Effective macroeconomic policies are also important because of financial instability’s impact on the macroeconomy more generally. Externalities from financial instability have implications for the real economy and growing, bursting as -
set price bubbles affect wealth, investment and the availability of finance. There will be feedback effects between speculation and entrepreneurship via equity markets because, as identified within Tobin’s q models of fixed asset investment, asset market valuations will affect new investment directly if market capitalization is used as a proxy for future profitability. There will also be indirect impacts if stock market buoyancy is interpreted as a signal of wider business confidence. Overall, if financial markets are struggling then this will lead to declines in fixed asset investment with knock-on effects for employment, consumption and growth.
Designing effective financial policies will be difficult and Keynes’s analysis of financial 
markets identifies the central policy dilemma. On one hand, unregulated financial mar -
kets encourage a liquidity “fetish”, exacerbating financial instability. Whilst speculation  283 Controll Ing F Ina nCIal  InStaBIlItY
does no harm as “bubbles on the steady stream of enterprise” a problem emerges when 
“enterprise becomes a bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital develop -
ment of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done” (Keynes 1936, p. 159). On the other hand, Keynes writes that the,
spectacle of modern investment markets has sometimes moved me towards the con -
clusion that to make the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble, like 
marriage, except by reason of death or other grave cause, might be a useful remedy.... But a little consideration of this expedient brings us up against a dilemma, and shows us how the liquidity of investment markets often facilitates, though it sometimes im -
pedes, the course of new investment.
(Keynes 1936, p. 160)
In reconciling this dilemma, Keynes believed that financial markets should be supported 
but with government intervention to control and slow market excesses (Keynes 1936; see also Backhouse and Bateman 2011).
One potential policy solution receiving a lot of attention recently is the Tobin tax, initially 
proposed by James Tobin as a way to “throw sand in the wheels” and moderate volatility in currency markets (Tobin 1974, 1978). It has also been developed as a potential solution to restraining short-termism in financial markets in order to promote macroeconomic stability,  
but it is problematic because it would require a high level of international policy coordina -
tion to prevent the shift of financial services to tax havens. Domestic political constraints are likely to compromise international attempts to coordinate policy. Returning to Akerlof and Shiller (2009), they emphasize that the impact of their psychological drivers in the form of animal spirits, and the impact of these on financial markets means that governments have an important role to play in complementing capitalism. As noted in Chapter 16, the government has a responsibility to set the rules within which capitalism should exist. To control real and financial instability, fiscal and monetary stimuli are not enough. Also, financial flows should be targeted and smoothed via injections of lending and capital. This will ensure that finan -
cial stability does not undermine an economy’s path towards full employment.
Other financial policies designed to ensure a stable financial system and thus a stable 
macroeconomy include government regulations – particularly those involving stress test -
ing of banks, capital controls to limit international movement of capital, minimum capital reserve ratios and institutional changes to separate retail and investment banking. These restrictions will limit the spread of consequences if traders are engaging in impulsive risk-taking at a systematic level – especially when this risk-taking is magnified across fi -
nancial markets , with macroeconomic impacts. These policy insights have been the focus 
of recent changes in financial policy, for example in the UK and in response to Basel III.
~
This chapter has explored the wide range of psychological factors and behavioural biases driving financial instability, with macroeconomic impacts – including social influences, biases and heuristics, animal spirits and emotions. With herding and reflexivity, these biases can spread through financial markets via speculative trading generating financial instability.284 
Financial instability , macroeconomic  per Formance
In terms of broader implications, if herding and speculation are rational responses 
to uncertainty and informational constraints, then policies to ensure the quick and ef -
ficient dissemination of information will be justified. But if herding were the outcome 
of more emotional and impulsive responses, then there would also be a role for govern -
ment in controlling financial instability. Baseline versions of standard models based on assumptions of rational expectations and efficient markets will have limited relevance though adaptations to standard models which incorporate asymmetric information and principal-agent problems do offer some useful insights about encouraging transparency, improving information transmissions and correcting misaligned incentives.
From a modern behavioural finance perspective, if economic behaviour is the out -
come of psychological forces such as impulsive risk-taking rather than logical, objective decision-making thought processes, then government intervention has a particularly im -
portant role to play, particularly as computerization, globalization and increased leverag -
ing enabled by financial deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s have amplified the speed and liquidity of financial markets today relative to Keynes’s time.
Chapter summary
 •Assumptions from mainstream financial theory, about rational expectations and ef -
ficient financial markets, are overturned in behavioural finance – in which financial instability is explained as a product of emotional and socio-psychological influences as well as market and institutional failures.
 •Financial markets are inefficient when asset prices are susceptible to speculative bub -
bles, that is, they do not follow the fundamental value of assets – defined as the pres -
ent value of the discounted stream of expected future returns on that asset.
 •Behavioural finance suggests a range of socio-psychological reasons for financial mar -
ket inefficiency and speculative bubbles, including time inconsistency, animal spirits, impacts from mood and weather, financial herding and social mood.
 •Akerlof and Shiller’s analysis of animal spirits can be applied in financial markets to capture financial instability – with corruption playing a key role as a driver of finan -
cial instability  and macroeconomic impacts.
 •Keynes analysed three main drivers of financial herding: social learning, beauty con -
tests and reputation.
 •Approaches building on Keynes’s insights have been used to explain how financial in -
stability has negative impacts on the real economy – most famously Hyman Minsky’s financial fragility hypothesis.
 •Insights from behavioural economics and finance can be used to advocate additional policy instruments to control financial instability and its deleterious macroeconomic impacts – including capital controls and stress testing of banks.

Happiness and well-being
In Chapter 16, we explored how insights from behavioural economics can be embed -
ded into conventional macroeconomic models, buil ding on the idea that macroeconomic 
success is driven by economic growth and employment. Behavioural economists’ per -
spectives on macroeconomic performance are shifting, however, as psychological and 
sociological influences come more directly into behavioural economic models as macro -
economic goals in themselves. This brings us to the happiness and well-being literature. We will explore in this chapter how ideas about happiness and well-being can connect with key insights from behavioural economics to give a whole new picture of what we want and need within modern economies.
Happiness
Happiness is a subjective feeling and therefore is affected by some of the moods and emotions that we explored in Chapter 9. It will also be affected by individual differences, for example some evidence shows that the French claim to be unhappier than Americans even though, as objectively measured, their standard of living is greater. A wide range of socio-economic decisions will affect an individual’s happiness including marriage, di -
vorce, criminality and addiction, amongst others. In A Treatise on the Family (1991), Becker applies rational choice principles to everyday decision-making asserting that these reflect a rational, maximizing balancing of economic benefits and costs. For example, people marry and divorce when they perceive that the overall benefits from entering into or breaking the marriage contract outweigh the costs.
A lot of behavioural economics focuses on the ways in which these rational choice 
principles are violated in the real world. Antisocial and self-destructive behaviours may be the product of a complex range of motivations, including behaviours that are associated with irrational and/or ill-informed decision-making. Rather than balancing benefits and costs in a symmetric and systematic way, people will prefer avoiding losses to making gains, and happiness will be affected by changing situations not the status quo. In this way, hedonic psychology, the psychology of well-being, can be brought into the analysis of happiness. Anchoring effects will operate when people’s decisions and choices reflect  287 HaPPI nESS
what they have experienced already: if they are happy with a given situation then they 
will anchor their expectations of future happiness to what they are currently experi -
encing. Framing effects will also bring the psychological context into people’s reported perceptions of personal issues. When students were asked: “Are you happy?” and “When did you last have a date?” the students’ answers were affected both by which question is asked first and by how things had gone the night before.
Utility and happiness
Kahneman and Tverksy’s (1979) critique of expected utility theory (EUT), explored in Chapter 4, does not focus specifically on problems with the basic concept of utility, though Loomes and Sugden’s (1982) regret theory does start to unravel some of the limitations of a stark conception of utility. In later work however, broader concepts of utility are addressed by Kahneman (2003, 2011). Utility is, in essence, about happiness, satisfaction and pleasure. Whilst standard approaches make utility seem like quite an objective concept it is inherently subjective – the subjectivity is acknowledged in a math -
ematical sense in EUT but in the process stripping out the emotional aspects of utility for reasons of tractability. Some areas of behavioural economics aim to develop a deeper understanding of utility and its complexities. Also, later analyses incorporate ideas and insights from psychology.
Standard conceptions of utility focus on one homogenous quality, revealed through 
choice. Behavioural economists have a more nuanced view and distinguish between dif -
ferent sources of utility including decision utility and experienced utility. Decision utility is about outcomes, and fits with a standard conception of utility. Experienced utility can be subdivided into instant utility which is about current, real-time experiences and re -
membered utility which is retrospective and because it focuses on current evaluations of past experiences is susceptible to some of the biases and heuristics outlined in Chapter 3, particularly biases emerging from the misapplication of the availability heuristic (Kahne -
man et al. 1997). Kahneman et al . 1997 develop a normative theory of utility focusing on 
the experienced utility from outcomes which are extended over time. They also allow a role for learning, noting that learning may bring different types of utility together. They also propose a neuroeconomic approach postulating that remembered, chosen and expe -
rienced utility will each be associated with neural areas. Conflicts will emerge because the different forms of utility may not coincide, for example addicts anticipate utility and so choose to consume a drug but then find that experienced utility is not so pleasurable, a conflict which is explored in more detail in Chapter 8.
Kahneman and Tversky’s research propelled a whole new approach to economics – 
hedonic psychology – the psychology of well-being. In one sense, hedonic psychology is a modern development of utilitarianism – a moral doctrine, associated with the English economist and philosopher Jeremy Bentham, asserting that actions should be assessed according to their impact on utility, that is, on pleasure, satisfaction and happiness. Pareto (1906) focuses on a narrower concept, namely ophelimity – measuring just eco -
nomic satisfaction to separate it from broader moral, political and religious aspects of utility. In hedonic psychology, people are making subjective judgements about their own happiness, for example in the context of decisions such as to marry or divorce, and these judgements will not necessarily tie in with monetary measures. In  marriage  and divorce 288 HaPPI nESS  an D WEll -BE Ing
for example, it is the change in circumstances that affects people’s perceptions of their 
own happiness.
People will judge their own happiness against a benchmark of what they’ve experi -
enced in the past. For married couples, their experience of marriage and divorce is deter -
mined by the recent past so happiness peaks at the point of marriage but falls rapidly until after (on average) two years of marriage it stabilizes at a level equivalent to (and some-times below) premarital happiness levels (Layard 2005). Stutzer and Frey (2006) develop these ideas analysing marriage using German survey evidence: their analysis suggests that happy singles are more likely to select into marriage and unhappy people are likely to self-select into divorce. Different life events may not be separable in terms of their impacts on happiness; for example, Rowthorn (1999) notes that contagion effects may operate in marriage if attitudes and expectations influence the likelihood of divorce. DeNeve and Cooper (1998) in a meta-analysis of personality traits find that personality traits, includ -
ing the Big Five factors of extraversion and agreeableness, were significantly correlated with happiness, life satisfaction and positive affect, though the correlations with negative affect are less significant.
So, overall, happiness is about more than the balancing of monetary benefits and costs. 
There will be spillover effects and socio-psychological factors will have an impact too. Layard (2005) analyses the paradoxes that underlie the pursuit of happiness, particularly issues of status, security and trust. Rising incomes in the advanced nations have coincided with increasing income disparities, declining job security and rising crime rates, all of which have compromised status, security and trust. Similarly, Frey (2008) focuses on the hedonic consequences of unemployment emphasizing that employment offers more than an income. Subjective well-being is also compromised and so unemployment involves not only the direct effects but also indirect impacts: he roughly and cautiously estimates that the unemployed suffer a 0.33% fall in happiness.
Happiness is a specific mood but other moods will affect decision-making too. The rec -
ognition of differences between anticipated, experienced and remembered utility, as men -
tioned above, leaves a role for moods and emotions, for example weather has an impact on mood and through that on financial markets, as explained in Chapter 17  (Kamstra et  al. 2003; 
Hirschleifer and Shumway 2003). Happiness will affect other aspects of standard of liv -
ing too. Wilson and Oswald (2005) find positive associations between marriage and health (both physical and psychological) identifying health gains from being married. 
 Edl
und 
(2005) focuses on the impact of marital decisions on labour mobility and migration and hypothesizes that females will move to urban areas because they are attracted by the higher incomes of the richer urban men. Gautier et al . (2005) assert that singles are more likely to 
pay higher property prices in cities because there are better marriage markets in cities.
Ifcher and Zarghamee (2011) analyse self-reported levels of happiness from the US 
General Social Survey and find that positive affect increases patience and makes people less likely to “live for today”. They confirm the association with a random assignment experiment: a “positive affect” treatment group was shown a mood-enhancing film clip, for example a clip from a stand-up comic routine, and moods were measured to confirm the effect of the film clip. A “neutral affect” control group was shown clips of landscapes and wildlife. Both groups were asked to state their present value equivalents of a payment in the future and the subjects in the positive affect group were signifi -
cantly more patient. 289 HUMan  CaP Ital  InVE StMEnt
Human capital investment
Individual differences in personality traits and cognitive skills have implications for hu -
man capital investment. Identifying when and if traits can change is an important ques -
tion. The returns from investment in education, for example, will depend on the relative 
impact of nature and genes versus nurture and the environment on a child’s development. If environmental factors play a significant role then parental investment in a child’s learn -
ing environment can enable the evolution of productive traits. Early childhood interven -
tions may also play a role because developing complex skills requires effort, practice and exposure to productive learning opportunities.
One of the relevant issues is the extent to which personality traits and cognitive skills 
can change over a lifetime. Are personality and cognition plastic and flexible? Or are they rigid and set in plaster? If personality is rigid then the returns to investment in enhancing cognition and social skills are likely to be relatively low, with knock-on effects for life sat -
isfaction and well-being more generally . The malleability of personality can be captured 
empirically by exploring mean level changes and rank order stability. Mean level changes are generally thought to reflect the impact of environmental factors and genetic factors are thought to be responsible for the stability of traits, though there are some key exceptions.
Borghans et al. (2008) explore the evidence on mean level changes and rank order sta -
bility and identify and a number of significant mean leave changes in traits over lifetime. Different traits evolve at different speeds over the life cycle with cognitive processing speed developing rapidly to peak in late adolescence. Conscientiousness, social dominance (part of extraversion) rise, and emotional stability increase steadily over a person’s life -
time. Social vitality (another aspect of extraversion) and openness rise then fall. Personal -
ity change in adulthood also reflects social roles. Female workforce participation increases confidence and identity may also play a role in this.
Rank order stability in traits increases steadily over a lifetime and although stability 
is often attributed to heritability, environment also plays a role. A range of individual dif -
ferences can be ascribed to genetic factors. Cesarini et al.  (2009 a) use evidence from twin 
studies to show that genetic differences capture about 20% of the variation in preferences for giving and also risk-taking. Cesarini et al.  (2009b) use another set of twin studies to 
show that overconfidence in cognitive ability, measured as the difference between per -
ceived and actual rank scores in a general intelligence test, is affected by both genetic and environmental differences with genetic factors explaining 16–34% of the variation in overconfidence. Cesarini et al.  (2010) also identify a genetic component to risk-taking: 
they analyse evidence about the pension fund choices of Swedish twins and find that ge -
netic variations empirically capture around 25% of the variation in portfolio risk. IQ also reflects an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. It is a relatively stable trait with strong genetic links but gains in IQ between generations suggest that environmental factors also play a role (Dickens and Flynn 2001).
Personality and cognition are particularly malleable in very early childhood. An 
early critical period for intellectual development may reflect neurobiological factors and the development of neural connections (Borghans et al . 2008). Children adopted by high 
socio-economic status parents have larger gains in IQ points also suggesting that envi -
ronmental factors are important (Borghans et al.  2008). Early interventions such as en -
riched childcare centres and home visits can alleviate disadvantage. Whilst they were 290 HaPPI nESS  an D WEll -BE Ing
designed primarily to improve cognitive skills, their success came mostly in boosting 
personality  skills.
Heckman et al. (2010a,b) analyse evidence from a controlled childhood intervention via 
the HighScope Perry Preschool Program (PPSP). For the children in the treatment group, the scheme was designed to educate children from disadvantaged African American back -
grounds by exposing them to a curriculum tailored to facilitate the development of cog -
nitive and socio-emotional skills via active, open-ended learning and problem-
 so
lving. 
The participants were selected on the basis of IQ scores and family socio-  ec
onomic status. 
This reflected not significant gains in IQ, but improvement in other areas. Treatment and controls were followed to age 40 and included  academic achievement and social skills , 
both of which are crucial to life satisfaction more generally. Heckman et al.  conclude that 
personality and motivation are as crucial to early success as cognitive ability and IQ.
Cunha and Heckman (2007) and Cunha et al . (2010) have used insights about the role 
of personality and cognitive skills on attainment to develop production models which in -
corporate the technology of skill formation. Using these models, they determine the opti -
mal level of targeting for interventions. Returns to investment in cognitive/non-
 co
gnitive 
skills formation decline as children develop and marginal returns are higher for disadvan -
taged groups. This suggests that investment in skills formation should be targeted towards very young children from underprivileged socio-economic groups.
Overall, these findings suggest that investment in early childhood interventions can 
generate benefits not only for the individuals involved but also for society as a whole. Heckman et al. estimate that the overall social rate of return for the treatment group – in 
terms of reduced criminality and benefit dependency together with increased educational attainment, earning power and employability, was around 7–10%.
Well-being
The literatures on well-being – across psychology as well as economics – are burgeoning. What’s the difference between well-being and happiness? General well-being is the mac -
roeconomic manifestation of general happiness. Well-being is about standards of living and happiness plays a part in well-being but so do other outcomes, for example access to healthcare, educational attainment, longevity, Internet access, and so on. General aspects of the quality of life are captured in measures such as the human development index (HDI) and the quality of life index (QLI) and well-being is a broader concept and captures not only GDP/GNP and physical standards of living but also the hedonic aspects. Well-
 
be
ing is a global concept capturing incomes, physical standards of living and happiness. 
There is increasing interest in measuring well-being and behavioural economics offers some insights into how to capture the psychological, hedonic nature of happiness and to build this into a macroeconomic measure of aggregate well-being. Well-being has both intrinsic and instrumental value: instrumental because happiness promotes learning, pro -
ductivity, creativity and health which all have impacts on social welfare. But it also has an intrinsic value of its own which partly links it with utilitarianism. Time is important: it takes time to build communities to sustain well-being (Huppert and So 2011).
Analyses of well-being often focus on relationships, physiology and opportuni -
ties. Many aspects of everyday life affect our feelings of well-being: employment/un -
employment, environment, commuting, social activities, environmental quality, illness  291 WEll- BEI ng
and treatment, and new technology. It is not always obvious what will be good for our 
well-being: Facebook may be good if it allows us to build online social networks for those who don’t have other social opportunities but if it is at the expense of real relationships then the net impact is less clear. On the other hand, whilst the common conception may be that computer games are bad for well-being, studies of prosocial computer games have shown that these can enhance well-being particularly as they link to social influence and the environment.
Well-being is not just about mood. Mood and personality together play a role, for 
example optimists are more likely to be happy and are also likely to have better life 
 ou
tcomes – as shown in a study of ageing and longevity which identified longer life-spans 
amongst those with a positive disposition (Kato et al.  2012). Huppert argues that well-  
be
ing concepts are complex. They focus on flourishing and “functionings” and relate to 
Sen’s capabilities, for example see Sen (2004a,b). Functionings are enhanced by resilience, strong relationships and social networks, as well as feelings, moods and emotions. In con -
ceptualizing well-being, it is important to focus not just on the hedonic aspects associated with individual physical pleasures but also on more eudaemonic aspects associated with a full and active life.
Seaford et al. (2011) outlines five well-being imperatives: connect, be active, take 
notice, keep learning and keep giving. The relative importance of different drivers will vary across groups and areas and behavioural concepts such as loss aversion will be rel -
evant. For example, loss of income is hedonically disproportionately worse than a gain in income, as explained in Chapter 4 on prospect theory. This loss aversion, specifically aversion to losing time, might explain why people report that commuting substantially decreases their life satisfaction. Loss aversion also connects well with the intuition that job security is important and negative correlations between well-being and unemploy -
ment have been identified. Part-time workers are also less happy than full-time workers. This was demonstrated in a Canada case study on the Canadian Community Innovation Project which explored the impact on perceptions of satisfaction in moving from income assistance (i.e. focus on money) to employment insurance (i.e. focus on jobs). Other fac -
tors that affect well-being include social capital. Well-being is also about social groups and networks. Baumeister and Leary (1995) discuss well-being as being about the need for connections. Personal resources such as sleep and physical activity also contribute to well-being.
Looking at it from the other direction, barriers to well-being include external barriers 
(for example, time, money) and internal barriers (for example, pessimism). There are also psychosocial barriers including habits, social norms, powerlessness feelings and exclusion. Overall well-being depends on social activity as well as economic activity (Halper 2014).
Halpern (2014) also discusses aspects of well-being in terms of conflicts between 
goals and outcome, for example being healthy and having a healthy lifestyle are not necessarily the same and being healthy is more important to well-being than having a healthy lifestyle. This raises the question of the extent to which well-being drivers are under individual control. What externalities are created that can affect the well-being of others? Driving a Porsche is an example: it generates negative externalities for some, in the form of envy. On the other hand, social relationships can generate positive exter -
nalities. There will also be unintended consequences, for example the “school gate phe -
nomenon”: some institutions generate positive externalities even though that wasn’t the 292 HaPPI nESS  an D WEll -BE Ing
original intention; the school gate is a place where families can meet other families and 
build connections generating positive externalities even though the school gate was not designed for this  purpose.
Well-being and the environment
One aspect of well-being which is developing a pressing importance is the relationship between well-being and the environment. Environmental problems will have an im -
pact on people’s well-being, particularly if they create concerns amongst individuals. The European Commission (2002) conducted 7,500 interviews for 15 member states of 
the EU and found that 89% of respondents were concerned about environmental pollu -
tion; 86% about natural resources and waste generation and 82% about trends relating to nature and wildlife; 72% are concerned about climate change; 73% believe that the environment influences the quality of life very much or quite a lot relative to 64% for economic and social factors. These attitudes are relatively robust over recent time with not much change since the global financial crisis and recession. The 2011 Eurobarome -
ter Surveys on the environment and climate change found that 95% of EU citizens feel that protecting the environment is personally important to them and 76% believe that environmental problems have a direct impact on their lives though only 69% believe that they should be personally responsible for using natural resources more effectively. For climate change, 68% support environmental taxes but just 53% had taken some sort of action to combat climate change; 66% reduced and recycled waste. This survey evidence reveals some inconsistencies between the significance of climate change and actions taken to combat climate change. In addition, some respondents seem not to realize that recycling is an activity that can help to combat climate change (European Commission 2011a).
Gowdy (2008) rejects the standard rational actor view that there is a trade-off be-
tween material consumption and environmental protection. Increasing per capita income does not increase well-being beyond a certain point and drastic reduction in fossil fuel use will mean a reduction in production of consumer goods but if welfare policy goals can shift from income to well-being more broadly defined then this will be a positive development, that is  there will be no trade-off. Similarly, developing countries that are 
reorienting policies towards living a full life rather than income creation may also expe -
rience benefits in terms of alleviating environmental pressures.
Weber (2011) notes the importance of voluntary reductions in energy consumption 
but most Western households fail to install energy-saving technologies even if they’d save money in the long term if they did. They also seem reluctant to make personal sacrifices in terms of lifestyle and some argue that this is because they have not experienced the con -
sequences of climate change, with implications for well-being more generally. However, empirical evidence does not suggest that lack of experience reduces motivations to act. Actions to reduce energy use not related to uncertainty about climate change existing, has more to do with whether or not they think that their behaviour will be effective.
Desires to maintain current quality of life will also lead to inertia especially as con -
spicuous consumption can signal social status. The sacrifices that people are prepared to make will reflect their socio-economic conditions, for example a Pennsylvania survey analysed the role of wealth and environmental attitudes in environmental action and  293 WEll- BEI ng
found no significant association between personal economic conditions and environmen -
tal concerns , though people on lower incomes were less willing to incur monetary costs 
and richer people were less willing to sacrifice living standards and comforts (Pongiglione 
2011). Other factors affecting positive environmental action include knowledge, an in -
ternal locus of control (taking personal responsibility), and perceived threats to personal health (Fransson and Gärling 1999).
To assess the impact of socio-economic status and environmental attitudes, Baddeley 
(2011b) analyses survey responses from 2,764 respondents to Northern Ireland’s Con -
tinuous Household Survey 2009/10, using ordered probit techniques. The data suggests that apathy (low levels of reported concern about environmental issues) is associated with reduced environmental action. Environmental awareness (familiarity with common phrases about environmental conservation etc.) correlates positively and significantly with the number of environmentally sustainable actions taken, though this survey may be susceptible to self-reporting biases given the positive normative connotations of pos -
itive environmental action. Larger household size also has a positive significant impact, perhaps because social pressure increases when observed and/or encouraged by others. Owner-occupiers also are more likely to engage in environmental action. Socio-economic status (as measured by whether or not the household depended on benefits), number of children, the age of housing and whether or not the householders were public-rental ten -
ants were insignificant suggesting that poverty does not constrain environmental actions and the presence of children does not either.
Leiserowitz (2006) also notes that people claim to be very concerned about climate 
change, ranking it highly on lists of global threats; but when it comes closer to home and people are asked to judge more proximate threats, climate change is low on lists of prior -
ities. Leiserowitz argues that people do not perceive climate change as a direct threat; this links to the impact of vividness and emotions on behaviour – people do not have vivid, concrete, personally salient affective images of climate change and so environmental be -
haviour change is a low priority.
The evidence about the impact of first-hand (and devastating) experiences of environ -
mental calamities is mixed. Spence et al.  (2011) analyse UK survey data from 1,822 indi -
viduals and find that flood victims were more concerned about climate change and were more confident that their actions would have an effect. Other studies suggest that direct experience of the impacts of climate change may restrain action if it leads to cognitive suppression of frightening realities (Pongiglione 2011). Lorenzoni et al.  (2007) observe that 
motivation depends on people believing that their actions will be effective but a 2004 BBC poll shows that only about a half of people think that behavioural changes will impact on climate change. This may link to feelings of powerlessness. Experience of detrimental consequences of climate change does not necessarily link to mitigation efforts and re -
sponses to questions about willingness to change behaviour to protect the environment. Whitmarsh (2008) reports survey evidence showing that the salience of risk does not predict behaviour: those who had experienced floods were no more likely to think that the problem could be solved. UK flood victims felt unable to control their situation during the floods and so did not expect to be able to take effective action against climatic events in the future; there are no significant differences in the responses of UK flood victims and non-victims in attitudes towards combating climate change (Pongiglione 2011, Spence et  al.  
2011, Whitmarsh 2008).294 HaPPI nESS  an D WEll -BE Ing
Direct experience may in fact restrain action if cognitive dissonance/cognitive sup -
pression take hold; fear and helplessness may be paralysing (Pongiglione 2011, McNamara 
and Grubb 2011).
Strauss (2008) analysed responses from a Swiss rural community: 95 residents were 
interviewed and most acknowledged that climate change was taking place but felt help -
less and preferred to focus actions on things they could control. Norgaard (2006) in -
terviewed people in a Norwegian rural community and found that people recognized climatic changes and had a high level of knowledge about the climate but made no mitiga -
tion efforts, instead associating climate change with fear and helplessness. These feelings of helplessness may be exacerbated by a social organization of denial because motiva -
tion is harder if people feel that they are acting alone and that there is no impetus to collective  action.
Yates and Aronson (1983) emphasize salience and vividness and argue that there is 
too much emphasis on initial costs; more vividness is needed in energy-saving advice. Similarly, Bazerman (2006) asserts that one of the problems is that environmental damage is not a vivid threat: it does not engage emotional, visceral responses and this encourages apathy. This could also link to salience and the availability heuristic: people form percep -
tions and decisions on the basis of recent experience but if people have not experienced the consequences of environmental damage then they are less likely to worry about it (see also Sunstein 2006, discussed above).
thinking about happiness
Some of the new tools from neuroeconomics (as we explored in Chapters 11 and 12) – a new subdiscipline of behavioural economics which blends economics with 
 ne
uroscience – 
have given behavioural economists new insights about how people think about happiness. As for other areas of macroeconomics, there are significant methodological constraints on using neuroeconomic insights for macroeconomic analyses of well-being. Almost by definition, neuroeconomics is a microeconomic tool and although “hyper-scanning” technology is being developed to enable the analysis of neural activations across groups of people, there is a limit to what neuroeconomics can contribute when it comes to ag -
gregate behaviour on a macroeconomic scale. There are, however, a number of studies exploring the neural correlates of well-being and happiness in individuals.
Lykken and Tellegen (1996) studied identical twins and found that genetic inher -
itance accounts for half of variance in happiness levels. Urry et al.  (2004) used EEG to 
analyse the responses of 84 people to questions about mood and happiness. They found more activity in the left cortex associated with higher happiness levels. Davidson (2004) used fMRI techniques to establish that emotional stress leads to activations in the amyg -
dala and right prefrontal cortex, confirming some of the findings outlined in Part III  
about the neural correlates of emotions. Davidson constructed a bell curve of people in resting state and found that the ratio of right and left prefrontal activations predicts a person’s happiness
Habel et al. (2005) used fMRI techniques to analyse the responses of 26 male, healthy 
subjects experiencing positive and negative emotional experiences. They found that, rel -
ative to a control task, sad and happy moods were associated with significant activations  295 tHI nkIn g a BoUt HaPP InES S
in the amygdala and hippocampus extending into the prefrontal cortex and anterior cin -
gulate. Sadness was associated with stronger activations found in the ventrolateral pre -
frontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the temporal gyrus , whereas 
happiness was associated with stronger activations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC), the cingulate gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus and the cerebellum. This sug -
gests that mood valence is affected by specific neural pathways.
Lutz et al. (2004) identified significant increases in gamma rhythms (neural oscillations 
associated with consciousness) during meditation and also found significantly higher left prefrontal cortex activity in Himalayan monks meditating. Davidson et al.  (2003) also 
analysed the impact of medication in exploring the relationships between well-being, affective style and mindfulness. Mindfulness involves being attentive to thoughts, as a means of reducing stress. They analysed highflying employees from a biotech firm who were enrolled in a two-month meditation course. The responses of this treatment group were compared with a control group. For the treatment group after meditation, the left prefrontal cortex was more active, perhaps reflecting the benefits from meditation. Strengthened neural circuits in the left pre-frontal cortex perhaps enabled  more effective 
inhibition of amygdala activity which, as explained in Chapters 11 and 12, is active in processing negative emotions. The effects endured and the experimenters could still see changes four months after the course had concluded.
Measuring well-being
One of the problems with a policy focus on well-being is its measurement. Even if goals are clear, effective and reliable, measurement tools are needed to assess whether or not these goals are being met. Maximizing growth in GDP/GNP implies a monetary measure of happiness and whilst it has many limitations it is relatively easy to calculate. Standard macroeconomic measurement also has problems because whilst it appears that we have an objective unit of account in the form of money, if money has a value in itself then it cannot capture the value of other things. Nonetheless, it is probably even more difficult to construct a behavioural measure because there is a clear place to start in constructing an equivalent for broader measures of well-being. The main insights about well-being often start with the Easterlin paradox (Easterlin 1974, 1995): cross-sectional analyses of reported happiness do not show that happiness increases with rising incomes.
One of the problems with well-being is how to effectively capture and measure 
it over time and across space. Subjective well-being is usually measured via surveys of life satisfaction measures. Some data also concentrates on outcomes in terms of “ill-being”, that is, mental health outcomes as a measure of the inverse of well-being and this has some resonances with behavioural stocks of capital, for example as seen in Becker et al. ’s (1991) concept of addictive capital – introduction in Chapter 8. Survey 
data does complicate cross-sectional comparisons of well-being. Value judgements can distort comparisons especially if the focus is on simple rankings because these do not take into account different expectations (e.g. the fact that Denmark was recently ranked first in terms of well-being and France was much lower down may reflect different cultural expectations). Different speeds of adaptation to expectation s will also affect 
survey measures of well-being and simple rankings do not capture the spread and 296 HaPPI nESS  an D WEll -BE Ing
dispersion of outcomes. Separating relative versus absolute well-being is problematic 
without some basic unit of account, though, in the other direction, monetary measures of inequality do capture more about general well-being than a simple absolute measure of income.
Spatial distributions of things which generate well-being have impacts too, compli -
cating well-being measurement: a tree planted in a city has more positive impacts and externalities than a tree planted in the country because even though either will contribute to environmental quality via carbon capture and storage, in a city a tree will increase well-being more because of its hedonic impacts. This phenomenon is difficult to cap -
ture, even using green GDP measures. It would also be useful to have ways of weighting well-being, for example the well-being of children and young people is especially impor -
tant to examine because they have more time ahead of them on average.
There are alternatives to happiness surveys including surveys concentrating on par -
ticular aspects of well-being, for example the Happy Planet Index, national accounts of well-being and measuring progress. Also, some survey analyses have identified interest -
ing links between economic and financial events and broader evaluations of well-
 be
ing. 
Deaton (2011) links financial crisis to well-being and used a range of self-reported well-being measures from the Gallup polls to capture the impact, in the USA, of fi -
nancial crisis and recession on people’s emotions and their evaluation of their circum -
stances. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Americans reported sharp declines in their evaluations of their circumstances accompanied by sharp increases in worry and stress, and declines in positive affect. The American population proved to be remarkably resilient however and by the end of 2010 many of the survey measures had improved.
Some researchers have also measured happiness using semantic methods, for example 
examining twitter feeds. There are similar ways to measure confidence, for example by counting Google searches for gold prices to capture when people are feeling pessimistic about the financial situation. Another way to capture empirically some aspects of happi -
ness and well-being is to use case studies, for example of marriage and divorce, religion, and so on. Some data collection initiatives have recognized the  limitations of some of 
these approaches and have adopted more complex approaches, for example psychometric factor analysis which is used in the European social survey. The European social survey incorporates three sets of factors: hedonic appraisal including feelings and emotions; pos -
itive functioning including competence and positive relationships; and positive attributes, including resilience, optimism and self-esteem.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK is developing new initiatives 
too, emphasizing links with equality/sustainability, that is, multidimensional aspects of well-being. In  2011 the ONS released its first report on life satisfaction and well-being 
(see ONS 2011) and four  questions have now been incorporated into the ONS integrated 
household survey, focusing on householders’ happiness, satisfaction, anxiety and wor -
thiness ( that is, worthwhile things done), with rankings on a 0–10 scale. There are also 
plans to elaborate the data collection by including questions on opinions surveys. The problem with self-report surveys is that respondents might not be honest and/or may lack insight into their own circumstances. Nonetheless, measuring well-being does pro -
vide richer information about people’s standards of living than the standard policy anal -
ysis of goals and data focused on employment/unemployment, inflation and growth. 297 CHaPtEr S UMM arY
Well-being in macroeconomic policy
As we explored in Chapter 16, boosting growth and employment have been the key macroe -
conomic policy goals for most governments until recently. Now the focus is starting to shift 
away from macroeconomic goals framed around monetary measures of macroeconomic performance, towards goals that reflect more directly the psychological well-being of a soci -
ety. Insights about happiness and well-being are changing profoundly the ways in which we think about the characteristics of a successful economy, shifting the emphasis away from an exclusive focus on economic performance towards a more holistic understanding. The goals of macroeconomic policy are changing. Governments are shifting focus away from stand -
ard monetary measures of economic progress such as GDP and GNP towards more broadly defined socio-economic goals. Whilst broader measures of economic progress, including indexes such as the Human Development Index, have been around for some time, govern -
ments and policy-makers are increasingly interested in targeting other aspects of macroeco -
nomic performance, using some of the new data sources outlined in the previous section.
Behavioural economics extends the range of goals towards conceptualizing and meas -
uring well-being and happiness on a macroeconomic scale. Policy-makers are focusing on the quality of life increasingly, in recognition of the Easterlin paradox and other sim -
ilar analyses which demonstrate that monetary gain does not necessarily translate into improved macroeconomic welfare. In terms of behavioural approaches to defining and measuring macroeconomic goals relating to well-being and happiness, there is a substan -
tial literature, though future advances could be made by moulding the disparate bits and pieces of this literature into a coherent whole.
Chapter summary
 •Replacing macroeconomic models of growth based on human capital accumulation, behavioural economists such as James Heckman, have developed alternative behav -
ioural human capital accumulation models which bring a personality dimension into the accumulation of human capital – allowing  a role for behavioural influences.
 •These insights offer an alternative to the measures of macroeconomic performance focused on monetary measurement of gross domestic product/gross national product.
 •New concepts and measurements of happiness and well-being require new insights about utility – replacing economists’ traditional conception of utility as one, fungible thing with different conceptions of utility, for example remembered utility versus experienced utility versus anticipated utility.
 •Alternative approaches to understanding and measuring macroeconomic performance are evolving – based on wider measures of well-being, happiness and life satisfaction.
 •Neuroimaging experiments have confirmed that happiness and well-being have a multifaceted nature mediated by different neural areas, and welfare is not just about monetary measures but reflects complex interactions of cognitive and emotional influences.
 •New insights about happiness and well-being are finding their way into govern -
ments’ sets of policy goals – with an increasing number of governments now target -
ing well-being and life satisfaction as macroeconomic policy goals , alongside more 
traditional macroeconomic policy goals such as reducing unemployment, controlling inflation, balancing fiscal and national accounts and stabilizing currencies.298 HaPPI nESS  an D WEll -BE Ing
